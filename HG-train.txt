Wow.  I was barely able to put this book down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked.  Suzanne Collins narrative here has an immediacy to it that, when combined with the very dramatic life-or-death plot, is incredibly compelling.  It's entertaining, and incredibly disturbing all at once.  If this was merely a good read, I would have given it 4 stars, but they say great art leaves you changed after you experience it...  and this book definitely did that.  Suzanne Collins has, with one amazing work, propelled herself onto my top shelf.  Parents, caveat emptor!  The storyline is brutal.  Even though the writing is geared for young adults, the main characters are teenagers, there's very little physical romance, and the actual violence would probably count as PG-13 nowadays...  it's probably one of the most terrifying books I've read in a very long time!  Right up there with George R.R. Martin, if not more so.  Remember what we learned from Jaws: you don't actually need to SEE the shark in order for it to be terrifying.  Sometimes not seeing the shark is even worse.  The story is basically about a teenager who is forced to compete in a 24-man-enter-1-man-leaves event.  I don't want to spoil it by saying any more, but if you liked The Running Man, you'll definitely like this.  And if you're young enough that you don't remember The Running Man, nor did you get the Thunderdome reference, then I'm just way too old.  But take an old fogey's advice and read this book.  Amazon, when can I preorder book 2???
Clearly Gregor was merely the prelude. Suzanne Collins, you've been holding out on us, missy. As an author we were accustomed to your fun adventures involving a boy, his sister, and a world beneath our world. I think it's fair to say that we weren't really expecting something like The Hunger Games. At least I wasn't. But reading it gave me a horribly familiar feeling. There is a certain strain of book that can hypnotize you into believing that you are in another time and place roughly 2.3 seconds after you put that book down. Life As We Knew It by Susan Beth Pfeffer could convince me that there were simply not enough canned goods in my home. And The Hunger Games? Well as I walked down the street I was under the disctinc impression that there were hidden cameras everywhere, charting my progress home. Collins has written a book that is exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns. It ascends to the highest forms of the science fiction genre and will create all new fans for the writer. One of the best books of the 2008 year.  Life in District 12 isn't easy for Katniss and her family. Ever since her father died the girl has spent her time saving her mother and little sister Prim from starvation by hunting on forbidden land. But worst of all is reaping day. Once a year the government chooses two children from each of the twelve districts to compete against one another in a live and televised reality show. Twenty-four kids and teens enter, and only one survives. When Prim's name is called, Katniss exchanges herself without hesitation to compete alongside the baker's boy Peeta. To survive in this game you need to win the heart of your audience, and so District 12's trainers come up with a plan. Why not make it as if Peeta and Katniss were in love with one another? But in a game where only one person can live, Katniss will have to use all her brains, wits, and instincts to determine who to trust and how to outwit the game's creators.  I described the plot of this book to my husband, particularly the part where Katniss and Peeta fake being in love to gain the audience's approval and the very first thing he said was, "Oh! That's the plot of They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" Then I mentioned that it took place in the future and that government leaders set up teenagers to fight one another to the death and he said, "Battle Royale". So sure, there are parts of this plot that have been done before. You could say it's The Game meets Spartacus with some Survivor thrown in for spice. But that's not what makes a book good or bad, is it? Some of the greatest works of literature out there, regardless of the readerships' age, comes about when an author takes overdone or familiar themes and then makes them entirely new through the brilliance of their own writing. Harry Potter wouldn't have been any great shakes if it weren't for Rowling's storytelling. Similarly, Collins takes ideas that have certainly seen the light of day before and concocts an amazingly addictive text. About the time you get to the fifth chapter that ends with a sentence that forces you to read on, you're scratching your head wondering how the heck she DOES that.  Your story often rests on the shoulders of the protagonist. Is this a believable character? Do you root for him or her? Because basically it is a very hard thing to create a "good" person on the page that your reader is going to fall in love with. Because we readers know that we are flawed, we are often inclined to side with the similarly flawed people we meet between a book's covers. Katniss, on the other hand, is so good in so many ways. She sacrifices herself for her sister. She tries to save people in the game. But there's almost a jock mentality to her too. Katniss can figure out the puzzles and problems in the game, but when it comes to emotional complexity she's sometimes up a tree. Most remarkable to me was the fact that Katniss could walk around, oblivious to romance, and not bug me. Seriously, nothing gets under my skin faster than heroines who can't see that their fellow fellas are jonesing for them. You just want to bonk the ladies upside the head with a brick or something. The different here is maybe the fact that since Katniss knows that Peeta has to play a part, she uses that excuse (however unconsciously) to justify his seeming affection for her. Thems smart writing.  Oh! And did I mention the dialogue at all? The humor? Yep, there's humor. We're talking about a story where adolescents hunger for blood, and Katniss is getting in lines about her trainers like, "And then, because it's Effie and she's apparently required by law to say something awful..." Good stuff. The words pop off the page. And then there's the fact that we're dealing with a dystopian novel where the author has somehow managed to create a believable future. No faux slang here, or casual references to extinct dolphins. There are some animals that were scientifically altered, but you can't have a future without a couple cool details like that, right?  In general, this book throws a big fat wrench into the boy book/girl book view of child/teen literature. People love to characterize books by gender. It stars a boy? Boy book. A girl? Girl book. Now take a long lengthy look at the first book in the Hunger Games Trilogy. It stars a girl... and a boy too. There's a lot of hunting, fighting, and survival... and a lot of romance, kisses, and cool outfits. There's strategy, the world's most fabulous fashion designer, weapons and a girl who knows how to fight. This is not a book that quietly slots into our preconceived stereotypes. And you know what happens to books that span genders? They sell very well indeed. That is, if you can get both boys and girls to read them.  The age range? Well, for most of this story I would have said ten and up. I mean, yeah the basic premise is that a lot of teenagers go around killing one another, and sure there's some romance to deal with, but none of it really seems inappropriate... until a final death scene appears in the book. I won't give any details, but suffice it to say it is gruesome. There are definite horror elements to it as well, so with that in mind I am upping my recommendation to 12 and up. I'm sure that there are 10-year-olds out there who've seen much worse stuff on cable, just as there are 12-year-olds who'll freak out ten pages in. Still, I'm more comfortable recommending it for the older kids rather than the younger. You'll see why.  It occurs to me that there has never been a quintessential futuristic gladiator book for kids. That is undoubtedly the roughest term you can give this book. Now I'm not a person who cries easily when she reads something, particularly something for kids. Yet as I was taking a train to Long Island I found myself tearing up over significant parts of this story. It's good. And it's so ridiculous that a work of science fiction like this could even be so good. You think of futuristic arena tales and your mind instantly sinks to the lowest common denominator. What Collins has done here is set up a series that will sink its teeth into readers. The future of this book will go one of two ways. Either it will remain an unappreciated cult classic for years to come or it will be fully appreciated right from the start and lauded. My money lies with the latter. A contender in its own right.
I'll be honest and say that I wanted to love this book. I was breathless with excitement when I downloaded it, and couldn't wait to start reading. With the rave reviews coming from almost everywhere I turned, right down to celebrities gushing their love for this series, I went into it with high hopes. The premise sounded fascinating. In fact, I'm pretty sure I turned to my husband and said the plot sounded "brilliant" when I first read a synopsis.  Brilliant, it was not. It was interesting, and I strained to stay awake late at night a couple of times just to read a few more pages. But for every moment of excitement, I felt an equal moment of letdown.  Let's face a few facts:  ~ The main character, Katniss, is dull. She is thoroughly useful, to be sure, using her skills and determination to hunt outside the Seam to feed her family (and then to outwit opponents in the Hunger Games arena), but there is nothing about her that is riveting or even relatable. She seems almost void of feeling throughout most of the book, tossing aside emotions and flitting from one mental capacity to the next without much notice. I find it hard to believe that any human being could be horrified by the thought of killing their fellow Tribute one moment and then mesmerized by their own beautiful appearance the next. These dissonances make Katniss seem silly and almost irritating at times.  ~ The writing style is frustrating. While I am all for the use of fragments to create drama and suspense, they are OVER-used in this book, to a point that is infuriating. I found myself irked within the first few paragraphs. Fragments for dramatic impact are one thing; fragments used repeatedly on every page are just insulting to the reader. I realize this is a young adult book, and I am above the intended audience age by a good decade or so. But even a teenager with average reading skills should find the continuous use of poor grammar to be unacceptable.  ~ The premise, as a whole, lacks authenticity. In order to enjoy this book, you MUST accept everything at face value. You must accept that the people of Panem are so resigned to - or, in some cases, so engaged by - the barbarism that is the Hunger Games, they never question it. In fact, in seventy-four years, not even one Tribute has questioned the mandate that they must fight to the death in this arena, until Katniss Everdeen does. Not one parent has stepped forward and tried to stop this horrific massacre from occurring. Suzanne Collins wants you to accept that the Capitol is so powerful, so impenetrable, that the districts of Panem are held under its thumb as if by a powerful drug. And, really, wouldn't they have to be drugged to behave in such a fashion?  Without any expansion on the characters other than Katniss herself (and perhaps Peeta a little bit), the climax of the book does not reach its full potential. I would have liked to see a prologue or any type of flashback to a time before now, to get a more vivid sense of the evil that is the Capitol. The book lacks a tangible, detailed villain. That is my primary complaint. There is something to be said for a mysterious, menacing presence as a villain - as in Stephen King's "The Stand", for instance - but even in The Stand, the villain is eventually expanded upon to make him seem more real a threat.  The Hunger Games is a good book. It's interesting. It certainly keeps the reader at rapt attention. I think the violence is too much for a young adult novel, but it is also necessary to the premise. I just wish the author had given a little more thought to human nature and not expected her readers to so willingly submit to the plot without question. Perhaps she really believes this is a representation of human nature. Based on the number of rave reviewers who can't seem to find fault with the book in any way, perhaps she is right.
You've got to hand it to Collins: No one can plot a fantasy novel like her. Nobody. She has you not from the first page or the first graf, but the first *word*. She creates believable, likable and riveting characters, ridiculously addictive survival scenarios and a rich world to boot. If you aren't up until 4 a.m. finishing this thing, you're a corpse.  My only problem with this novel also happens to be a very big problem: the overall premise. I'm not spoiling anything by mentioning that the plot involves kids pitted against each other in a giant outdoor slugfest to the death. Again: Kids pitted against each other in a fight to the death. Oh, and it's all on TV. Everyone in this post-apocalyptic world either thinks that's neat, or throws up his or her hands and figures there's nothing that can be done about it.  The author explains this away by creating a world of poverty and hunger; the parents of the young gladiators are so beaten down and afraid of the totalitarian regime that they just hug their kids and shut up and pray, but -- and this is just my opinion -- that's not an effective enough mechanism. It simply doesn't jibe with human nature. Even the starving, terrorized parents of child soldiers in Africa have been known to drag themselves into the bush and track their kids down or die trying. As much as I loved everything else about this book, I can't get past the basic setup. Isn't there one parent out there, one crazy uncle or scrappy rebellious mom, who'd stand up and protest at this amazingly cruel custom? There's not a single voice among the privileged rich in Capital City who might kick up a fuss? I know we're talking about a cruel dictatorship -- and an all-powerful one, at that -- but parental bonds have been known to be very strong things, and I think the author could have done a better job selling us on why the barbarism continues.
It took me a while to get to this book because I never saw it out of my two daughters' hands.  They devoured it!  Once I read it, I understood.  This is the second book I have reviewed this month that had a powerful female protagonist (other being 'Graceling').  I found the book to be well written with a fantastic pacing. Their is violence in there, but not so over the top as to be distracting.  Intimate scenes are sparingly written so as not to be too embarassing (something I greatly appreciated as a dad!!) The rage against the system theme is prevalent enough to notice, but not as overbearing as say.... Ayn Rand or Terry Pratchett.  All in all, I highly recommend this book for kids from 12 up.  The ending leads me to believe that this will be a series.  I imagine I will be pre-ordering as soon as it's available.  Congratulation Ms. Collins!!  All the best,  Jay
I was told for about a year that I just had to read this book.  And it certainly sounded like something that would be up my alley.  I love children's literature and a dystopian future situation is always appealing.  The idea of this book was a classic idea, oppressed society under the thumb of a cruel government.  But it seems that Collins leaves a lot to be desired.  For a book with such intense promise it had a surprising lack of heart and soul.  This should have held a lot more humanity, but instead I was treated to a rather dry battle of kids trying to kill each other and not much else.  How did this happen? For one thing, Collins has yet to master the art of characterization.  These characters were nothing but flat descriptions to whom Collins doesn't even pretend to give personality.  I could tell you absolutely nothing about the nature of anyone.  Even the protagonist Katniss is sadly two-dimensional.  She cares for her sister and she can fight. That was all I took from her.  Then on top of this a romance is forced with zero chemistry. Granted, situations were provided where reasonable romance can come in, but emotion to back it up? Nothing.  The storytelling is weak.  Collins relies far too much on summarizing events to keep the story moving, a bad choice that does "get on with things" but misses an opportunity to build world, drama, and characters.  Much of the plot is indeed devoted to the games--which means battle, of course--but that's it.  The writing itself is not bad. It's simple and straight forward, a style I've always liked, but the rest of the necessary components of story and character are missing, so the writing becomes just a dry account of an emotionless story.  The violence is fun, and there were a select few moments that captivated my interest, but that was it.  The sad thing is that "The Hunger Games" is not a bad idea at all.  But the delivery was poorly executed.
While I will say that I wanted to keep reading, it just is not a great book.  The Hunger Games is a mix of Roller Ball, Death Race 2000, and The Running Man.  The plot is well-documented in other reviews.  My issues with the book are few, but are significant enough to justify a two-star rating.  The Ending.  I believe it was too abrupt and almost 'tune in next time for the exciting conclusion of.....' aka 'buy the next book'.  The book lacked complete, or at least adequate, resolution.  The Psychology.  The story centers around children, most being randomly chosen by lottery, who fight to the death in "The Hunger Games" as a penalty for a past rebellion against the ruling Capitol.  They are dressed up, trained, and prepped for the spectacle which is broadcast to the nation on television.  Speaking for myself, being placed in this position, I would be in a state of stunned shock - even if the games had become an accepted but despised evil in society, as I'm sure many readers would argue.  The author set the main characters off on psychological tangents, such as admiring how good they looked in their costumes,  how well their interviews went, how good the food was, etc...  Being placed in the same position, did not ring true to me.  The Morality.  The book creates a very strong moral dilemma: "as an unlucky participant in the Hunger Games, I'm going to have to kill innocent children, like myself, simply to survive".  The book sets up a horrible situation for the main characters and then, I believe, lets them off too easily.  This is especially annoying when the 'rules' of the Hunger Games are changed (three times!).  I could give many examples, but want to avoid spoilers.  This really is a Young Adult book, which unlike many, will not satisfy the majority of adults (but apparently I'm in the minority).  I will say again, the book was compelling enough for me to look forward to my nightly reading sessions, but has some major flaws.
I must disagree with the glowing reviews this novel has received.  As much as I loved The Underland Chronicles, I didn't like this one.  First of all, it is written in the present tense. I know authors sometimes do this to give a "sense of immediacy", but I'd far rather have the story written compellingly enough not to need to use this crutch.  So, to me it was just an irritating gimmick.  Furthermore, having the protagonist narrate from moment-to-moment stifled character development.  The author tried to work around that problem with some flashbacks, but even those were put in the present tense.  Also, the ending is given away by the fact that it is in first person: the narrator cannot die because she is around to do the narrating.  Perhaps Collins' thought that writing in present tense would solve that weakness of first person narration inevitably revealing that the narrating character cannot die, but I was not able to suspend my disbelief quite that much.  I found the premise to be cliched:  a dystopian society in which coming-of-age rituals have been turned into something sadistic.  While used effectively in "The Tripod" trilogy, in this story the device didn't work as well for me.  If the bottom age range of those whose names were placed in hazard were a couple of years older, this might have been more plausible.  But, as it stands, I found that the premise was stretching it.  So, overall this novel was a major disappointment.  I hope that Suzanne Collins' future endeavors will surpass The Underland Chronicles, but for me this wasn't the project that will do so.  Had I not read and loved her previous novels, I would have considered the writer of The Hunger Games to be an amateur.  I will give the novel the small credit it deserves for being just interesting enough to cause me to finish reading it.  However, I won't be reading the future installments in this series.  The one redeeming value of the book was the character Peeta.  I really did like him.  It is too bad that the first person present tense narration so greatly limited Collins' freedom to explore this character.
Everyone around me has been talking about this book and I finally got a chance to read it.  I burned through it in less than a weekend, but I found myself wanting to like it more than I actually did.  The plot went extremely fast (and normally I read quite slow), but to me there was no depth to the story.  Each revelation the main character had seemed forced to me.  I felt like I was constantly being told this or that fact was important,  or the main character felt this way without the prose actually making me *feel* that way.  It was just too much telling and not enough showing.  Also, the dialogue throughout (epsecially between Peeta and Katniss) felt so stilted and rang very untrue to me.  Often sentences were confusing and sometimes scenes transitioned so quickly it was confusing I had to read over a passage a few times.  (It seemed on more than one occasion that Katniss had spent her last arrow, when in the next scene she was reloading her bow.)  There was even a typo in my copy.  ***SPOILERS***  I was expecting a more literary story (i.e. more thematic symbols--more could've been done with the mockingjay pin and the fire symbology, both missed opportunities on Collins's part.  The ending was a pure cop out: more could've been done to push the characters to their absolute limits and examine how far one really would go for survival.  It seems counterintuitive to say so, but there were so many cop outs in this plot, so many "deus ex machinas", that I grew frustrated with the believability of the plot.  Just when things seemed to get really juicy, the diffcult option was removed from Katniss's (and Peeta's) choice of options--every time she was in a position to have to kill a character she cared about, some outside force came in and killed them off.  (Rue, Thresh, Foxface.  Even Cato's death was more of a mercy killing.)  Imagine how profound the story would've been if she had to have allied with Rue and then have been forced to kill her in cold blood later on.  That's exactly what I was expecting when I started reading this book--I couldn't imagine it any other way than that she'd bond with the other children and then be forced to kill them, and then deal with those emotions.  Instead she got off the hook emotionally each time, and the story just felt flat to me because of it.  I really wanted the story to push her to her psychological limits in addition to physical limits.  She just made out too easily for a dystopian story centered around kids killing each other.  If she had been forced to kill Peeta, the story would've had some real weight to it.  (Though I suspect he's been kept alive mostly to set up a love triangle in the next book.)  The "stay tuned for Book Two!" ending only added to the frustration.  There is just no comparison to 1984 or The Giver, stories with real emotional weight, philosophical ideas, and more artfully-crafted prose.  I suppose the trend now is to have supposedly "dark" stories that are only dark in regards to action and plot, but lack any true psychological weight, and whose characters act coolly under pressure (except for a few obligatory tears) and emerge from the story unscathed in any profound sense.  (Who can forget Winston turning into coward at the end of 1984 and how his character is broken as a result?)  All in all, I feel this book had nothing to say about humanity.  There were glimmers of a theme, especially from the mouth of Peeta when he talks about dying his own terms, and when Katniss makes her first kill--but those themes are dealt with so briefly and then it's back to the action.  Peeta and Katniss feel more superficial towards the end of the story--I can't get any real sense of how they've changed after the Hunger Games, if at all.  We are only told in the exposition that Katniss feels different, but we are never quite shown how.  Same goes throughout the book--we are told some things are significant, but without any backstory, we can't feel how important they are.  Why is Katniss's decorating Rue's body with flowers such an act of defiance?  We are told after the fact that communication between Districts is forbidden.  Had we been told (or better yet, shown) that *beforehand*, the scene would've played differently.  There were just too many examples of events happening, then being told they were important after the fact.  Considering this is a best-seller, I was really surprised at the low quality of the writing style, even in regards to such basic things as scene transitions.  There were also a few elements that just seemed thrown in--like the muttations, that took more away from the story than added to it.  And must every YA book these days be written in first-person present tense?  A real disappointment and missed opportunity.  I really wanted it to be better after all the good things I heard about it.
Don't get me wrong: there is a LOT of good and even excellent science fiction and fantasy in the "young adult" (worst age-related euphemism ever) market. I enjoyed William Sleator's books in high school, and Garth Nix's Old Kingdom trilogy is among my favourite fantasy. So I thought this was worth a try, and it was. My overall impression of it was that it's enjoyable, and the plot moves along at a decent pace once it gets started. If you just want some book to kill time this will do. However, there is nothing particularly memorable or ingenious here.  The story is set on the east coast of what is now the United States of America. Presumably this is several hundred years in the future, after a war which has not only destroyed the USA but also cut the survivors off from the rest of the world. Around where Washington, D.C. used to be, there is a city called Panem surrounded by thirteen districts which supply it with food and materials, and are kept under control by Panem's technological superiority. The people in the districts, on the other hand, live in almost mediaeval conditions.  Every year two children are picked from each district and made to fight to the death in a reality TV show called "The Hunger Games". The sole survivor's district is showered with food for the rest of the year. Sixteen-year-old Katniss from District 12 is our narrator - the book is written in her voice. It's kind of choppy though, because sometimes the voice flows naturally as if she's telling the story to a friend, and at other times, especially when the writer is describing the world Katniss lives in, it sounds stilted and fake.  As mentioned, the story moves at a decent pace once it gets going. About two-fifths of the page count is spent on Katniss' life at home, her trip to Panem and grooming as a celebrity for the Games. We get a good overview of her world and how it got that way, but during this long introduction nothing feels all that important. A twist in relationships between Katniss and the other kid from District 12 is introduced.  Once all 24 children are in the arena, things get more interesting. The organizers play off the participants against each other by introducing obstacles, dropping gifts strategically, prodding them into "teams", and so on to make it more exciting. It's an effective parody of a reality TV show taken to its logical conclusion. Most of this was fun to read. The zombie werewolves near the end (I'm not kidding!) were the most ridiculous part.  To me the main weakness of the book was that, for all the intensely complicated relationships and griefs that Katniss experiences, and the atrocities that take place in her world, the author didn't make me feel an emotional connection to it. It feels like it's made up of a bunch of science fiction elements patched together, and between that and the stilted narrative voice, it didn't feel as real as it should have.
The 74th Annual Hunger Games are soon to begin. The Hunger Games are a fight to the death. In the new country of Panem, in the ruins of North America, each year as punishment for a rebellion and as a control mechanism, the Capitol forces each of the 12 provinces to draw names of a male and female tribute. The tributes are drawn from all people between the ages of 12 and 18. They receive training, are assessed by the game masters and then the betting begins. The games will be televised and are required viewing for the whole nation.  The draws are not exactly even though. You can choose to enter your name extra times, for yourself and for family members to receive a terse, a grain and oil supplement from the government. Thus enters our heroine Katniss Everdeen. She is entered this year 20 times as she is 16 and taken the terse every year, for herself, her sister and her mother. Her close friend Gale has his name in 42 times, but this is the last year he is eligible. Then Katniss has the worst fear hit - her younger sister Prim (short for Primrose) is drawn with her 1st and only ballot. Katniss then does the unthinkable; she volunteers to take Prim's place.  Katniss Everdeen knows that she has at least some chance of survival in the games. She has been secretly hunting in the woods and feeding her family since her father died years earlier. She hunts and gathers what she can with her friend and hunting partner Gale, in the woods beyond the fenced border of District 12. Yet even so, most believe she has just given up her life for her sisters.  Katniss and Peeta Mellark are the tributes from District 12 for the 74th annual hunger games. As they travel to the capitol they have two mentors - Haymitch Abernathy the only surviving Hunger Games winner from the district and Effie Trinket the Capitol's representative in the district. They will each in their own way try to help them to survive both the Capitol, to win favor with the citizens who can sponsor them in the games, and then the games themselves.  This book is very well written, the scenes sharp and crisp, the world believable and detailed. The characters become real as you read. You reach the end and are left hungry for more, which is what you will get as this is book one in a trilogy. The only drawback in my opinion is the lack of a map. I keep hoping for a map of Panem, with the 12 districts, the mysterious destroyed 13th district and the wilderness area's between them. Maybe it is just a guy thing, but I wanted a map. In this book Twenty-four are forced to enter the game zone but only the winner survives. You get a sample online. You can read chapter 1 online but it will only whet your appetite for more. There is also a video trailer for the book you can find online. This is a great Sci-fi book and would make an excellent movie.
Perhaps having read 'Battle Royale' by Koushun Takami before reading the Hunger Games somewhat ruined the novelty of the storyline. For those unfamiliar with it, Battle Royale was a Japanese cult classic (that eventually gained mainstream recognition) with the following premise;  The totalitarian nation of Japan has collapsed. At fifteen percent unemployment, ten million were out of work. 800,000 students boycotted school. The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Battle Royale act. Every year, a high school class (42 students) is selected at random by the government and taken to a secure location, where they are forced to kill one another until a single victor emerges. It is meant to quell rebellion and create fear in the general populace.  Somehow, Koushun Takami makes me care more about over twenty individual characters than I cared about Katniss Everdeen. The premise of Collins' novel is hardly original and she does not add any truly unique aspects to her story that capture my attention. I've already read to death the whole 'utopia ruling over the distopia' cliche... I was also unable to relate on an emotional level the trials Katniss faced. If the whole book was supported by the awful reality of forcing children to kill one another... that requires the reader to care not only for the main character, but the victims as well. In a melee that supposedly contains 24 children, Collins decides early not to focus on more than three of them, two of them being the main characters. As this is a young adult book and the first of a trilogy, that detracts heavily from the suspense that otherwise might have been garnered over the fate of the main character.  It is in this fashion that Battle Royale shines and The Hunger Games falters. I felt nothing at all while reading The Hunger Games as young children were murdered one by one without the reader learning so much as their name, let alone any sort of back story. Katniss could very well be prancing through the prairie cutting the heads off of dandelions for all I care. There is exactly one character that creates emotional impact, other than the main two characters.  The book is rather short, and the wording simplistic. I have read my fair share of young adult novels, and Collins is not that impressive in her prose. Also, and call me nitpicky, but I didn't read any sort of review or book summary before reading this book - therefore, I spent a large portion of the beginning of the book unclear on the gender of the main character. There is also no mention made of her looks. From what I can gather, she is white and has long hair. That's it. I could not tell you what color her hair is, what color her eyes are, how tall or short she is. I like to be able to hold a picture in my head of the people and places I am reading. Collins assigns very few physical attributes to her characters, and having finished the book I cannot describe to you what the Capitol looks like, or what her District looks like, or what Katniss' home looks like. No great effort is made by the author to develop her characters and settings into things you can see. I find this incredibly frustrating.  I will not be reading the rest of the series.  In all, I'd recommend someone read Battle Royale over reading this.
I don't believe in censorship, I let my kids read omniverously, but I'm grateful I picked up this series and checked it out. We'll be having some long conversations this weekend about the culture we live in and that produces books like this.  At first I thought these books would be a critique of Reality Television, of a corrupt and decadent society where some toil ceacelessly, and others amuse themselves endlessly like late-empire Romans. I hoped as I turned the pages that Suzanne Collins might have something real and important to say about how knowing that we are constantly being filmed changes the way we behave, even when we are in mortal peril. I hoped she'd have something to say about courage and love and the meaning of life and death.  Forget about it.  Where J.K. Rowling is an alchemist, collecting dross and ore from everwhere, and turning it into gold, Collins is a petty thief, stealing hamfistedly from Battle Royale, Survivor episodes and Project Runway. This series has the feel of something concocted by an editor a writer and a marketing director. Be sure to put in a bridal gown...the girls love bridal gowns! What upsets me the most is that she herself is a manipulative Gamekeeper who can make anything awful happen at will to her characters to move along her plot and she invites her readers to be like the audience who watches the Hunger Games, turning the pages to find out who will be slaughtered next and in what exciting way. Did she have any sense of irony or humor or satire (as Battle Royale does) that asked kids to question their experience, I'd forgive her everything, but she doesn't. It's all delivered very seriously. We are allowed to mourn for the very young and the very old but as to those trained for the gladitorial combats they are brute killing machines and we are allowed to cheer their demise. When Katniss kills...it's always in self-defense and she's killing someone who clealy deserves to die...she never is tortured by her own lack of morality. How convenient...  I am reminded of the zen story: You are having a dream that you are on a lifeboat with your mother and your father. You are told that the situation is such that you can only save one of them. Which would you choose?  In the Hunger Games, the characters struggle and wrestle with this question but Suzanne Collins hersel doesn't know the answer...the answer is "you are having a dream." Wake up!  Wake up Suzanne Collins.  In the second book she attempts to make it seem like Katniss will inspire or even lead a revolution in this corrupt dystopia...and maybe sort of she does. But it's all completley unwitting. She's a pawn even of the revolutionaries. Besides, since we don't really know anything much about the society, its governmental system, its foundation and maintenance, this is NOT 1984 (although I'm sure Collins would like to imagine for herself that it is.)  Finally, I am left thinking of Harry Potter, how J.K. Rowling wants her readers to feel the weight of each death in that book, of the good characters and the bad, the complex and the simple. Cedric Diggory is a minor character in some ways but his death is not minor. Harry will die to return his body to his parents. This is fiction that raises us up, that asks the best of us, the believes in the best in us.  Collins treats most of her characters like figures in an X-Box game, choosing one or two for us to mourn a little and then focusing on dispensing with her legions in all kinds of creative and inventive weighs.  My final take on these books? Plenty of action, the kids will gobble it up, bu they'll be as morally hungry when they are done as if they had been playing Mortal Combat. Let 'em read them, but please, parents, read them yourself and start a discussion about real revolutionaries, real courage, and real sacrifice.
I find myself at a loss to explain why so many people like this book so much. The premise sounds interesting enough, but it has been done before, is practically cliche in Japanese media, and Collins has not done it well.  The book is boring. Most of the first third is made of infodumps. They're not even well-executed infodumps. The writing style is simple and straightforward. Such a style can be fantastic when done right, but in this case it (with the exception of a few nonetheless forgettable passages) has no elegance or flavor; it's just plain boring, and it is incapable of rendering the infodumps anything more than snooze-inducing.  The plot is very predictable, and the author throws in a couple of plot twists that, rather than ramping up the tension, excitement, character development, or any of that, slaughter what little tension the plot possessed. They are deus ex machinas that save the main character from having to make the tough decisions one would expect from a book with this premise.  And the main character never has to make any truly tough decisions. She is never conflicted by anything except the book's contrived love triangle. Even when she is forced to kill, she feels little to no remorse. She just spends a sentence or two thinking about it with no particular emotion, and then forgets about it for the rest of the book. The author never lets her kill preemptively, only allowing her to act in self-defense, and her opponents are so poorly developed that the reader has no real reason to care about them.  The main character does not act consistently her age. At the beginning of the book, she acts in a reasonable manner for a sixteen year old subjected to poverty. But later in the book she seems more like a ten year old, both in the way she acts and in the way she is described (she apparently looks like a "little girl" in one particular dress, which is quite a feat considering her age). At almost the same time, she acts like some sort of hardened veteran in her utter unflappability.  All the characters are unflappable. For goodness sake, even the twelve-year old is unflappable. Where is all the emotional distress that should result from the threat of death and the necessity of killing innocents? From being suddenly and forcefully separated from family and friends? From being constantly monitored, starved, and injured?  Despite the book's unbelievability, predictability, and general terribleness, the second and third thirds of the book are admittedly somewhat entertaining. But still, I found myself skipping over large chunks of boring text even in the middle of the best of the action scenes. And the very best part of the book, the only part in which we are shown a relationship that feels relatively real, is all too brief. The mockingjays are cool, though.  I notice that many of the bafflingly few other low reviews cite the book's disturbingness as a reason for their low rating of it. I disagree with these people; this book needs to be more disturbing, not less. There's violence, but it is hardly graphic, and it happens to people the reader knows little to nothing about. This premise has so much potential for emotional turmoil, horror, and difficult decisions, but the book completely fails to deal with any of that and is presented in a sparkling clean and bloodless (and lifeless) manner. I actually find is disturbing how the book glosses over what should be a horrific situation.  In short, I have no bloody idea why people like this book so much. It's derivative, predictable, poorly written rubbish.
So this is what keeps troubling me about the book: as an adult reader, I cannot decide if this is merely a guilty pleasure, or a book with substance that, as the cover says, "explores the effects of war and violence on those coming of age."  Professional reviewers and Amazon reviewers alike seem to agree that the book has a political angle, and the inside cover goes so far as to say that it combines "suspense and philosophy."  To which I can only say.... if that is true, then it is certainly philosophy-lite, even for a YA novel.  I will, however, grant that it does have "unsettling parallels to our present."  The reason that I feel so ambivalent about it is that it is such a gripping and suspenseful read; it truly is difficult to put down.  But it is so in a way that reminds me of a video game: different opponents, each with specific abilities; changing settings which present new obstacles and hazards; a limited life-line buttressed with revitalizing finds or gifts.  Indeed, it's called "The Hunger Games"---duh, right?  And yet something about all of this bothers me.  It's structured like your standard voyage and return narrative, with many elements of the hero's quest.  But in this book there is no Grail, no Dragon.  The reward is simply your life, and the villains are merely pawns like the protagonist.  This lowers the stakes and even calls into doubt the idea of heroism.  Is fighting for your life heroic?  I tend to see self-defense as something very different from heroism.  The real evildoers are, of course, the game makers and the society which permits this atrocity to take place, but this aspect is never really developed (at least there is no climactic confrontation, and not much of a build up to one either).  True: the reader cannot help but to feel disgust for the game makers. True: one is appalled by the extent to which the media forces people to create a false persona and to live a lie.  But that is really the extent of the social commentary, and I felt like some opportunities were lost.  Ultimately, I found myself asking: Is this enough?  You want the characters to live (they are, after all, archetypes, and hence parts of us all---the courageous, the doomed, the saved).  But saying that the Roman Games are wrong as you sit down to watch the gladiators as they are thrown to the lions is not a critique, and shouldn't make us feel any less guilty about watching.  In the end, are we the readers just as bad as the spectators in the book?  If so, then we've been duped.  And I don't think this was Collins' intention.
I finally picked up this book because my sister and cousin had both just read it and had mixed feelings about it. After reading it, I have mixed feelings myself. The first thing I noticed upon opening it was that the author has terrible grammar. I wasn't sure if I wanted to finish it but I decided to read at least a few chapters. A few chapters in, I still wasn't sure if I liked it but I had to find out what happened. So I read it all the way through and I am still not sure whether I liked the book but I have to read the others and find out what happens. It is a little weird.  I think that this book is mostly so popular because of its "shock factor." It is violent in a way that is unusual in YA literature. Technically, it is not really any more violent than a lot of other YA and even children's novels that involve wars or other forms of conflict, nor is it more graphic or bloody. It is the form of violence that is different, where ordinary (well, mostly ordinary) kids are forced to kill each other even if they are or could be friends.  Katniss irritated me. Her self-absorption and obliviousness made it hard to like her. Not to mention the fact that she pretended to fall in love as a strategy. She got a little better towards the end, but I still couldn't make myself care for her except for the sake of her family and Peeta. I liked Peeta and the way he retained his soul no matter what happened. He was strong and brave without being as harsh as Katniss and he would try to protect her even when she did not care about him.  I stayed up very late because I had to get to the end of this book to see what happened, but not because I was enjoying it. There is something about the way the author paints a picture of such a cruel and horrible world that makes you keep reading in the hope that something good will happen. I would not particularly recommend this book to anyone, but I have to admit that it was an interesting story.
Perhaps it is the hype, perhaps I just don't get it. It took me most of the book before I realized why I did not like the writing: complete lack of figurative language. No metaphors, no similes, no analogies. For a book that tries so hard to immerse you into its very different world, I found this very disconnecting.  There is very little show, but a lot of tell. The story is first person present tense. Everything is from Katniss' perspective, where she tells you what she is feeling, what she sees, what she is doing, and what she is thinking. The problem is she tells you she is sad, or hungry, or scared. So I know she feels this, but I don't. There is very little description, no way for me to experience her world. What there is a lot of, however, is her thoughts: lots of rambling. While this makes sense: she is hunted and fear for her life in a very strange setting. It gets very, very tiring after a hundred pages. Yet this progresses throughout the entire book. If you can relate to a 14 year old girl, perhaps this will make more sense to you. But I obviously can't (not for the entire duration of the novel anyway), so this felt incredibly annoying. So there is no respite from the endless torrent of her inane thoughts. No other perspective from other characters.  And then there is the problem of character: Katniss has no personality. She is generically a good character. She is skilled at hunting, and she has a good heart. Whoop-dee-freaking-doo. Her main struggle is to stay alive, fake a relationship with the other guy from her district, and stay a live, and stay alive. There is no difficult moral dilemma to confront her. Every friendly person she encounters in the game that might pose such a problem is dealt with in some morally convenient manner. In short, she makes almost no real progression in her character. No development. She only begins to fall for the other guy from her district, Peeta, near the end, and he is but a one dimensional character even less fleshed out than Katniss.  Not even the basic premise worked for me: basically Battle Royale between strangers. While I had hoped since this was focused on just one character it would evoke more emotion, I was wrong. But what gets me is this: a dystopia where children are forced into gladiator style game and the districts are forced to watch, yet there is such a strong need to make it entertaining? If it is some form of punishment, why make it entertaining? I know this somehow makes sense within the context of the story, but I never thought it  believable. Maybe I am just too old for this.  This wouldn't be so bad if Katniss wasn't so thick-headed to begin with. Quite a few "surprises" were quite obvious from the beginning. But if you are new to pop stories fit for mass consumption (Hollywood, I'm looking at you) then you should find this entertaining.  While this book isn't for me, I realize I am in a very tiny minority. I just wanted to voice my opinion in case someone else finds it useful.
Rating System:  1 star = abysmal; some books deserve to be forgotten  2 star = poor; a total waste of time  3 star = good; worth the effort  4 star = very good; what writing should be  5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others  STORY: Katniss and Peeta are selected to represent District 12 in the Hunger Games. . .a last man standing game to the death. What makes this a higher risk game is that all the participants are in their early teens. The subjugated districts are required to participate in one way or another or face certain punishment, up to and including complete annihilation.  Where this book really shines, is it sets a post-apocalyptic world, in which a corrupt government keeps it "subjects" impoverished and subdued. By forcing the districts to give up their youth (one boy &amp; one girl) once a year to the Hunger Games, the government continues to remind people about the futility of revolt.  This setting has so much potential, but that is where it end.  The author focuses more on the relationship between Katniss and Peetra, and on surviving the games. These aren't bad things, but with a setting so rich in possibilities, those possibilities are only hinted at. I was hoping for something like V for Vendetta, Brave New World or 1984, but we are given an entertaining story that said very little about the need for rebellion.  Actually rebellion is hinted at but no indication if it will be explored further in books to come.  Yes, the characters are all memorable and likable. We cheer for Katniss and Peetra and want them to succeed. To me this means the author did her job in creating good characterization.  The story did end with the words "THE END BOOK ONE", but other than a new book showing us how the life of the winner changes, no other hint is provided. . .no other mysteries to solve or injustices that need righting are presented.  AGE APPROPRIATE CONTENT: There are a couple of "gruesome" scenes that may be a bit much for young readers. There is no profanity or sex in this story. Nakedness is referred to in the context of Katniss stands naked before the stylist who looks her up and down trying to decide how to dress her for the presentation. Overall its handled cleanly and even with a sense of modesty, which is something you don't see often these days and one thing I appreciated.  OVERALL: A story I kept turning the pages on, especially once the games began. Good pacing. Good characterization. The story was light on theme and failed to exploit its potential. Overall a good first book in a "potential" series.
The Hunger Games is one of those painful books, an excellent premise ruined (or almost ruined) by very flawed execution. The story sounds promising: 16-year old Katniss Everdeen (yes, really) is forced to compete in the titular Games, which involves 12 boys and 12 girls fighting to the death on live television. The world that this grisly tournament takes place in is suitably distopyian, and there are a few scenes near the beginning of the book that manage to effortlessly create a sense of tension and unease.  Unfortunately, things go downhill from there. The story is told in first-person present tense, which I'm assuming was meant to leave the reader in doubt as to Katniss's ultimate fate. If that was the case, it didn't work, and I found myself wishing I could take a break from living inside Katniss's head. She isn't the most endearing character in the world, and her frequent (and intrusive) flashbacks do little to flesh out her personality. It doesn't help that the writing can be stilted in places, particularly during the action scenes.  There are further disappointments when we get to see the Games themselves. The other Tributes, or contestants, are mostly given quite sparse characterization, which makes it difficult to care (with a few exceptions) when they start dropping like flies. The pseudo-love triangle between Katniss, her fellow Tribute Peeta and her longtime friend Gale also feels extremely forced and unnecessary, as if the author felt the need to put it in because she thought readers would expect it.  Actually, that explains another of the book's major flaws: it's status as a trilogy. It's painfully obvious throughout that certain plot points won't be explained until future volumes, but the story itself feels as if it should be self-contained. Did we really need the subplot about the Avox girl, which comes out of nowhere and just sits on the page lifelessly for the rest of the book? And what about the Capitol's 'muttations'?  All in all, The Hunger Games feels like wasted potential.
I can't believe this trilogy has me feeling so compelled to write my first ever Amazon review.  I'm not a review type of person.  However, I'd like to gently forewarn the next enthusiastic reader about The Hunger Games, Katniss and Suzanne Collins.  Because, I, for one was surely enthused.  Please know I really wanted to give the entire series a 5 star across the board.  I really did!!!  There was room for such great growth and potential.  Yet, I left the world of Panem feeling lukewarm, disturbed, and stunned.  Especially the ending to Book 1 and most definitely the last book, Book 3.  Suzanne is definitely not a happily ever after sort of author.  Which is fine - to each its own.  Now I know for future read.  With all the violence and darkness, I remained hopeful for a happy ending.  A ying/yang balance to all the ick.  I kept trudging along believing that hope will arrive, that I wouldn't be disappointed.  The time of hope never does arrive and I was disappointed.  It was more like a constant lingering tease.  Until you realize, "what have I done?" and go "DOH!"  O-M-G the characters are flat, 1 dimensional.  There was such richness for the main and secondary characters to be developed.  I was wishing for them to develop and grow.  Now onto the romance, first love, etc.  I'm saddened by the romance because you can't even truly call it one.  I'm a dubious sentimentalist and hopeless romantic.  It was just so unbelievable and annoying.  It felt like an afterthought, almost like let's toss the readers a mince bit of bone.  If there's a love triangle make it real and good - pump it with drama.  Instead Gale was missing for most of the entire series.  Katniss... oh Katniss!  I didn't like her and she's the heroine.  Like the series and my imaginings of 5 stars, I strived extra hard to like her.  In the end I found I wanted to slap her silly for being blind and entirely selfish.  Perhaps on the verge of wringing her neck.  You know shake her into realizing that love did surround her and to stop taking flight.  Even after the heroine realizes she was selfish, she didn't change.  Overall, I did enjoy my read of the series.  Therefore, can't will myself to give it less than 3 stars across the entire board.  I read all three books in 3.5 days.  I don't regret making my Kindle purchases or taking the time to read the trilogy.  I'm just sad that I wasn't able to find it amazing because I started so very hopeful/optimistic.  I'd even recommend others to give it a chance and see for themselves.  In this case I'm the minority (voice of the few who dare say otherwise), since so many people love the trilogy.  But in the end I wasn't impressed and it left a lingering bad after taste in my mind.  The only upside to this are the characters of Prim and Peeta (especially Peeta).  He was the redeeming quality and salvation to this messy atrocity.  If I can ask Suzanne, I'd like to know her decision of Finnick and Prim.  Than cry out, "why?"  How is this for YA?
I have only read the first book, but I am interested in reading more though I have to get this off my chest.  In the first book, _The Hunger Games_, we are introduced to a society that is similar or at least recognizable to own.  People still have to work; there is school and coal mining and other existent industries.  Nevertheless, there are huge differences.  America as we know it has ceased to exist.  Instead, the area that we know as North America is divided up into thirteen different districts strongly answerable to a central government at the Capitol.  Each of these districts has been set up in a fairly strict division of labor -each has its own industry outside of the general survival-level services: there is a coal-mining district, an agricultural district, a luxury goods district.  If district 12, the area we know most intimately, is in any way representative, the areas are small.  District 12 has only 8,000 residents.  If that is just an average, we can assume only 96,000 non-Capitol residents supporting the Capitol in their divided labor.  The life in the districts is Hobbesian: nasty, poor, brutish, and short.  Katniss, the heroine, has essentially raised her sister and her mom since her father died.  (It would not quite be children's literature if there were strong responsible parental figures around, would it).  The residents seem to be prisoners of their district.  There is little leisure, and little even electronic idiot-box stimulation of any kind as there is spotty electricity.  They certainly cannot go on holiday as their meager existence is surely scrapped by.  Even if they wished to wander, they are caged in to the district.  Aside from the quite literal prison nature of their existence, there are two strong forms of social control the Capitol exerts.  First, the reader is told that only twelve of the actual districts are inhabited.  There was once a district thirteen that must have been uppity so the Capitol incinerated the district.  If I remember, it is still smoking and polluting the downwind districts.  If you miss that, they play footage of the district on the television from time to time.  The second is that every year a male child and a female child must fight to the death in the annual "Hunger Games," the central element of the book.  This is the part that strains my credulity and kept me asking "Why" and "How"?  The reader of the book does not know enough of the back-story to know about the implementation of the games or the make-up of the central authority.  The early exposition is clumsy, forced, and unnatural.  The world of the Hunger Games is enough like our contemporary world it is hard to see how we got there from here and what was the precipitating cause (or it is so close I choose not to see it).  Whatever reason, it does not work for me and had I not already bought the second two books in the series I may have abandoned the text.  I am glad I did not because I decided that you just had to ignore the logic for the time being.  I wanted it to be something like Paulsen's Hatchet, but I decided it was better to accept the logic lain out by the author.  There is such a financial and technologic disparity between the Capitol and the districts there just has to be some underlying cause.  Once I got into the games proper, I enjoyed the text. Collins writes action well and the pages started turning with abandon.  However, there was still the nagging doubt about whether the central concern I have would be resolved.  I have to unfavorably compare the book to _Lord of the Flies_ and the Harry Potter books.  Both authors found novel and interesting ways to solve a problem Collins was not, in my opinion, able to - exploring the psychology of children in fantastic events.  The story is interesting, once she tells it.
Hunger Games  Katniss Everdeen is the teen protagonist of "The Hunger Games." Now if a heroine is named Kate or Cat or any variations, it seems to be literary law that she be spunky, quirky, tough and independent (but with a secret heart of gold).  And so it is here.  In the dystopian world she lives in, two youth are chosen from each "District" to engage in a fight to the death televised battle (think reality shows that result in fatalities) to win the Games and bring riches and honor to her family.  When her younger sister is chosen, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  The odds are against her, as some richer districts have been training their contestants since birth.  But Katniss is a skilled hunter and may have a few other advantages as well, including the alliance of another contestant from her own district who has had a lifelong crush on her.  While the book is a definite page turner with an engaging heroine, the Games themselves begin well and slide into absurdity, but then I tried to make sense of everything which was probably a mistake. The world presented has state-of-the art technology.  During the Games, those in charge have ability to manipulate the climate, broadcast exactly what's going on with the participants - even so the participants know who's died - and also send them supplies at a moment's notice (though they're supposedly out in the wilderness).  They can also genetically alter birds and animals, and have impressive medical advances.  Yet, at the same time, a certain percent of the population aren't permitted to use wheeled vehicles (cars, trains), must hunt and gather for their food, and use herbal remedies for serious health problems.  How this discrepancy came about is never addressed in depth, nor if it extends to the rest of the world.  The reader is simply supposed to accept things as they are, whereas in books like Lois Lowry's "The Giver" you get the impression the writer wants you to question things and probe further. Maybe that's an unfair comparision, but this book has gotten so much praise that I expected more.
I finished the novel thinking that this entire book was comprised just to sell other books.  While books like The Giver force you to think and evaluate humanity, morality, society, etc.  this book simply alluded to some of those issues and let them fall flat.  SPOILER:  There was much predictability here (except for the surprise robot/wolf/dead kid attack out of nowhere).  I sincerely hoped that after all the initial build up at the beginning of the story and later touched on about individuality winning out over the controlling government that the kids would have given the cameras, audience, and leaders the finger and made some proclamation that you CAN revolt... THEN actually killed themselves to prove it.  Instead, it ended with some sappy, team edward v. team jacob, buy the next book to find out what happens gimmick.  Yuck.  It's a page turner for the action.  Teens of both sexes will find something appealing here.  I just wish that Suzanne Collins had the guts to write a book with a real message.  The potential was there, however, I'm still hungry.
I've read the entire series, but I'm leaving my review here for those interested in picking it up. I'm not sure even where to start with this one. Oh yeah:  WARNING **********  SPOILERS *************  Anyhow, I avoided this series for a while because of it's YA status, I prefer darker and more serious matter. But I thought I'd give it a try when a friend dumped the books on my doorstep. Besides, it's got the main elements of some of my favorite stories: post-apocalypse, dystopian dictatorship, rebellion, the unlikely hero, tragedy, and survival. But what it lacked was character development, a believable plot, a likeable protagonist, or a satisfying conclusion.  First book: Hunger Games  First off, she didn't make the hero, Katniss, very likeable. I give this one a pass on the first book, because we're given to understand she's had a hard life and has trust and daddy issues. The lead up to the Games, everything in the book to this point was awesome. I was into it, and couldn't wait to get to the actual Games. But it started going downhill from there. The action in the Games was very abbreviated, to the point that we did not even know who some of the competitors were, or how they died. The book is from Katniss' point of view, so I assume since she's not privy to how the others' died, we won't be either. However, the book spends a great deal of time describing how every detail of the Games is recorded and broadcast, so I assume at some point we will be watching some broadcast with Katniss and find out what happened to the others, but not so. After the main emotional death in the arena (Rue), Katniss decides to seek out Peeta and team up with him. And everything pretty much derails from there. Katniss is saved from death several times by various deux ex machina plot devices, and the rest of the book mainly follows their tepid are-they-or-aren't-they romance.  By the end of the book I am annoyed mainly by two things:  1. That Katniss does not seemed emotionally moved by either Gale or Peeta. You would think that a nice character arc would have her at least leaning one way or the  other by the end of the book, but she stays in a perfectly boring limbo while at the same time leading two guys (who have risked their lives for her) on.  2. That Katniss doesn't seem particularly skilled, likeable, strong, or interesting. In books like this, I would expect that the "trial by fire" portion of the story would refine the main character's view of themselves, and create a sort of improved person, having been refined by the fire, so to speak. But not Katniss. She makes mistake after mistake, every time being saved from death by either a plot device or a person. Other than being able to track food, she doesn't seem to be good at making plans, following orders, or thinking ahead. She's not strong or particularly clever, she can't handle gore (??), and shuts down emotionally at the slightest provocation. It seems like during most of the Games she's laying around while other people kill each other off. Even in the end, she doesn't win by defeating every last victor - she wins by default because everyone else is dead (except Peeta, which you know how that ends). She's basically a very good woodsman (woodswoman?) with a significant amount of luck and inexplicable friendships.  Second book: Catching Fire  I hardly remember what it's about, it was that uninteresting. The author continues to doggedly bore us with the teetering menage-a-trois. And in a completely not-at-all-expected plot twist, the President orders a second Games for Katniss and Peeta to compete in. Add a few more characters, change the scenery, and it's another battle. Yawn. More of the same surly, abrasive, impulsive, reckless Katniss, that now for some reason has got the entire country holding her up as a rallying point for the rebellion. The book ends with them breaking her out of the arena and flying her toward the unknown District 13, where we expect to see the Final Battle in the third book.  Third book: Mockingjay  This book actually made me angry. Katniss is, if possible, even more dislikeable. She has so far managed to: endanger her family, get herself injured on the point of death several times, get other tributes killed on her behalf, had the entire District 12 wiped out, play head games with the boys, and be as uncooperative as possible. They are taken to the District 13 where she refuses to help and stays high most of the time. Then she decides to go fight, but as usual, messes everything up and does not follow order, acts recklessly, and gets a lot of people killed or injured. For whatever reason, they decide to send her to ANOTHER battle, where once again, she screws everything up and does not follow orders, and gets injured to the point of death AGAIN. Then they find out that Peeta is brainwashed somehow, and he does not love her anymore. Gale is fed up with her games, and hangs around to...make her feel bad? In any case, Katniss spends most of this book being shot or blown up, high or hiding in closets. Peeta spends most of this book absent, being tortured back at the capital, or heavily brainwashed, in which case there are no friendly words between him and Katniss. And once again, for the biggest battle of all, Katniss manages again to convince the people she has ignored and disrespected from Day 1 to let her go out there. And once again, she ends up somehow messing everything up and taking her team of camera men and one deranged Peeta on a direct assault on the President's mansion. Like I said, she's not much for planning.  Surprise, surprise, she manages to get almost everyone killed, including her sister Prim, who made enough of an appearance in the book to inexplicably materialize ahead of the invading force and be blown up (and the scene is handled so vaguely, I wasn't even sure it was Prim for a few pages), and Finnick, who grew as a character (shocker!) enough to become a major character, only to die in a throwaway line when they counted heads later. And what happens next? Katniss gets injured to the point of death. And spends the rest of the book moping around and being high. And killing someone else, but not the President, and oh lord this review is boring me worse than the book.  This book reminds me of the MST3K movie, "Agent for H.A.R.M." during which at one point, one of the guys says, "It's more like 'Old Guy Who Sort-of Helped Agent For H.A.R.M.'" There seems to be virtually no redeeming quality about the main character. Her surviving the plot has nothing to do with her talents, abilities, or personality, and everything to do with the Plot Gods resolving to keep her alive, but only barely. It's pathetic, really. And so are the people around her who seem to enjoy suffering death for a glimpse of her back as she ignores them or stomps out of the room. I gave this series 2 stars, because I love a good post-apocalypse, survival, Thunderdome, phoenix story, and this series served to, if nothing else, give me a framework to use when I'm re-imagining how it should have gone in my head.
I was puzzled (and, I'll admit, annoyed) to find that so many of the lower-rated reviews of "THE HUNGER GAMES" were all concerned with the book's content rather than its quality because, in my opinion, there wasn't anything to complain about on that front. Suzanne Collins had an excellent idea here, and as a storyteller, she's got some amazing potential.  I've had this book sitting on my shelf since it was released in 2008, long before the sudden explosion of popularity that "MOCKINGJAY" ushered in. So maybe it's all the recent hype that's paved the way for my disappointment. All I know is that by the end of this book, I wasn't impressed.  Nothing about Collins's writing stands out to me. In fact, her voice ranks as a low C on my grade scale; there was something incredibly remote and lifeless about the description, something flat in her dialogue and the story's tone. Collins build herself a fantastic world here, yet it came across as totally uninteresting through the protagonist's eyes. And after looking forward to seeing for myself all the good things I'd heard about Katniss, her lack of depth really surprised me. There wasn't anything I particularly liked about her supporting cast, either; cool names were everywhere, but there was a startling lack of cool development.  Overall, there's nothing wrong with "THE HUNGER GAMES". Not really. It was just a boring novel, plain and simple, another brilliant concept executed poorly. I had a relatively good time reading this, but unlike my friends, my experience with this trilogy ends here.  (Also, it would be awesome--AWESOME--if we could all stop comparing every YA dystopian/speculative fiction book to "THE HUNGER GAMES". Please. Please please please. It is absolutely killing me to see other novels bashed because, unlike the dozens of identical siblings in the paranormal genre, they've got so little in common with the "leader". Surprise, but dystopian fiction existed long before Suzanne Collins. )
I'm seventeen, and everybody and their mother told me to read The Hunger Games, because "it's incredible!". I finally decided "Why not?", despite the fact that I have long given up on Young Adult novels. Sure, I've come across some good ones, but The Hunger Games is a prime example of why I don't shop in that section anymore.  For what was advertised to me as an "awesome, fast-paced adventure", I was bored out of my mind from start to finish. With every turn of the page, I thought it'd get better, thinking surely something interesting had to happen or else people wouldn't be so obsessed with it. Twilight should have taught me that people can go nuts over poorly executed literature, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt.  The book is poorly written, in the POV of the main character, Katniss. When I say "poorly written", I mean both in the construct and execution of plot and characters, AND the writing style (e.g., Lots of cliche ideas, like "it feels like I was just dreaming", and one line I remember reading was "the saltiness of the soup reminds me of my tears". I find that ridiculous, like some moping Emo-stereotype) And, because the story is in first-person, I (*spoilers*?) started the book KNOWING that she wasn't going to die (not to mention, two books follow). I didn't feel any danger for her and I didn't like her. While, admittedly, I like the CONCEPT of the book, I didn't enjoy anything about it while reading. The characters and plot are one-dimensional. It was painfully predictable. Cliche. Boring. Immature.  The sad thing is, I think teenagers like this book because it requires no thought--it has no sustenance by means of developed characters or intricate plot. If we want people my age to start reading, should we really settle for feeding them empty stories like this one?
I have held out on reading this dystopian society book for nearly a year because I truly hated the premise of teenagers killing other teenagers (the series was lent to me by a friend). Since she and I are going to see the movie tomorrow afternoon (well, I was going to the see the movie--now I'm not too sure I'll go), I figured I'd better finally read the book.    After finishing it, I am hard put to figure out why everyone (adults and teenagers alike) is so gaga over it.  The violent premise of teenagers blithely killing other teenagers without a qualm (okay, I'll admit, not all of them--but enough of them), or the fact that the world is embracing this book where adults in charge are encouraging and exploiting such behavior--I don't know what I hate the most.  Why do writers today think that a YA book has to be full of murder, mayhem, and violence (on the internet or in person) against each other?  Yeah, I know that the main character and her fellow District 12 'Tribute' have no stomach for the Hunger Games and are chosen unwillingly; however, there are other teenagers in different 'Districts' that train for the Games since their early childhood--and volunteer willingly.  Ergo, they kill willingly and without conscience.    I'm disappointed in our culture...which preaches that bullying is wrong, passes laws mandating educators to 'control'  the propensity of some students to be mean and vicious to one another in schools, yet rave about books and TV shows (Glee comes to mind) that continually contain plots of said behavior being tolerated and or encouraged by the adults in charge.    On a side note, I hated the stilted, sophomoric writing as well.  Oh well--I guess I should stop my rant and finally join the 'Old Ladies' club.  Obviously that's where I belong.
I was debating between giving it 2 or 3 stars. Would have given it a 2.5 but apparently that option isn't available so I settled on a 3 because I was entertained as I read it, the action, suspense, and that whole thing of survival/living off the earth kept me interested. But there were some issues.  SPOILERS  - First of all, the world wasn't fleshed out enough. We're told that District 12 is in Appalachia, which makes sense because of the coal mining. But this district has about 8,000 people. Which made me wonder how big Panem is as a whole. Panem is in what was once North America, and the Capitol (the main city surrounded by the outlying 12 districts) is somewhere in the Rockies.  So...exactly what is the total population of Panem/North America? Because unless the other districts have a much higher population than District 12's 8,000, they are all very spread out for such a small population. Also, how are other parts of the world faring in this unspecified future time period? There is never any mention of areas outside of North America.  - I never understood some of the future technology. I understand this is Sci-fi so the tech might seem odd or unbelievable, but certain things weren't explained at all. One thing I noticed was how the tributes were being filmed at all times. Katniss and Peeta are filmed the entire time they're hidden in a cave as a storm rages outside - how did this work? There's nothing around them. Are they being filmed somehow because of the tracking devices inserted into their skin? Are there tiny cameras in the air around them? This is never explained in any way.  And I couldn't help wondering how far their privacy extended, about how people could conceivably watch them while they preformed acts like bathing or relieving themselves. Not that these types of activities are discussed in any great depth, or at all. I don't think Katniss ever talks about using the bathroom while out in the woods. We didn't need to see it happen of course, but it would be a struggle to do this in the forest much like finding food can be a struggle, so you assume it will be mentioned.  - Another thing that wasn't fleshed out a lot were the characters. Only a handful of them get any major focus, and even they are lacking a bit. You know just enough of them, but not enough to the point where they feel very real. Funny that Katniss ponders what her identity will be after she wins and will no longer have to spend her time hunting to feed her family. We're left wondering the same thing because that's the bulk of what we see of Katniss.  Luckily, most of the story has a fast enough pace where you don't notice it and it doesn't take away too much from what's happening. And the characters weren't necessarily bland. But at certain parts where things slow down and the characters interact, you can feel it. Beyond the surviver and hunter who knows her way around a bow and arrows, who is Katniss? There could be more there.  - There were a few "saving graces" that gave Katniss an easy way out of a bad situation, and it's unsatisfying. You pretty much know Katniss will live, and that's okay, because I spent much of the story wondering HOW Katniss would survive and how she would kill other people, how she would deal with the moral dilemma of hurting people she'd grown to care about to save herself, in a way submitting to the Capitol by losing herself and becoming their tool.  But instead of handling these tough choices that were intentionally set up from the beginning, they are usually done away with, in a way that makes it obvious the author didn't want to follow through with the grim nature of the story. Katniss makes only one direct kill, and that was out of revenge. Many of the kills she makes or is involved with are accidental, like when Foxface eats the poisonous berries called nightlock that Peeta had laid out for Katniss and himself. A nice way to kill off a very clever, strategic opponent who took food from others and prefered the tactic of evasion, which made an open confrontation less likely. But still a little too convenient.  Katniss rarely has to get her hands dirty, even though her possibly having to sacrifice morality in order to survive (for herself and her family as she says) was part of the drama. In this way she's absolved of a lot of guilt and responsibility.  It feels like a stretch when Thresh lets her go out of debt. The debt was because Katniss teamed up with Rue and avenged her death, but Thresh calls Rue "that little girl," suggesting he doesn't know her very well, if at all, and the only thing tying them together is that they're both from District 11. It's a little hard to believe he would lessen his own chances of victory for the sake of someone (Rue) he has little connection to, even considering the mutual understanding the poorer people have about being indebted to someone.  The one that really got me though was when the rules were changed so that both from a district could survive instead of just one. The entire premise was that there could only be one victor, and the sudden change two-thirds of the way through was another one of those obvious "saving graces" that kept Katniss from making hard decisions (killing Peeta). If Katniss and Peeta both had to survive, it could've been worked another, more creative way instead of having the Capitol pretend to change the rules, them take back the offer, then be forced to give in because of Katniss' threat (both her and Peeta killing themselves when the Capitol must have a victor).  - The love angle that was played felt forced. Having Katniss care for Peeta made sense, it strengthened her moral dilemma, but the romance wasn't that believable. Peeta has apparently watched Katniss from afar for years and loved her at first sight - that alone doesn't help with the "realness" of it. Katniss "pretends" to love him for the Capitol's cameras because it helps them get more food and adoration from the crowd, but it's as though she starts to believe her own act for some reason we can't see. Apparently because...well, we don't really know why, we're only shown Peeta's kindness towards her and struggle to help her survive, and that seems to be enough. It so obviously sets up a love triangle between them and Gale, which feels unnecessary.  - Anyway, I wasn't aware of this book until I got it as a Christmas gift, so I didn't know about the movie or the hype. In general, it's enjoyable enough and held my attention, so while I can't say I loved it, I liked it enough to continue - I will get around to the 2nd one and see how it goes. But Hunger Games didn't fufill it's potential, mainly because of the issues above. It's more of a fun read than one meant to make you think a whole lot.
I'm late to this particular game, given as how I've only just now read the book, but I managed to avoid all of the hype and chatter that apparently accompanied both the book release and the movie release, and I was able to read the book without any preconceived notions.  In short, this book is based on an intriguing premise, but never moves beyond being mildly entertaining on the most basic level. It is a very quick and light read, but that's not exactly the best approach to take to a theme which should be filled with moral ambiguities, gut-wrenching decisions (both literal and figurative), as well as social, political and philosophical challenges. If nothing else, the main characters could have been shown to struggle with these issues on a personal level, even if the author wanted to avoid having the book be too dense for younger readers. Instead, all of the complex tension which is hinted at in the beginning is deflated when the plot twists in every direction to avoid dealing with tough issues. For example, [SPOILER ALERT] when Katniss is forced into a gladiator's arena and is faced with killing both an endearing friend/love interest (Peeta) AND a young girl (Rue) that she takes under her wing, the reader is anticipating some genuinely thoughtful drama and character development; disappointingly, the author takes the easy way out by having Rue killed by a different tribute (in a barely plausible setting), and THEN having a bogus "rule change" occur in the middle of the games. Apologists will point out that the "rule change" was later rescinded, and yet it isn't realistic that Katniss and Peeta would have fought each other to the death as the last two contestants, whereas she may have let him die earlier in the games.  Ultimately, a braver plot would have made this a better book, but wouldn't have overcome the two-dimensional functionality of most characters in the book, nor the lack of artistry in the style of writing. Also disappointing was how poorly the book was proofread and copyedited (at times I felt like I was reading a Yahoo News article). While three starts seems a wee bit generous, two stars would be unfair, so I went ahead and rounded up.
The Hunger Games (2008) is the first in the super-popular young adult series by Suzanne Collins. Highly critically acclaimed, with a movie deal in the works, the trilogy has successfully sold millions of copies. (Scholastic must be very, very pleased.)  In the future, North America is divided into 13 districts (one a ruined wasteland), all controlled with an iron fist by the Capitol. The districts are still paying the price for a failed rebellion generations before - the government is doing its damndest to grind them into the ground.  Into this bleak future comes young Katniss, age 16. Katniss has taken care of her family ever since her father died - mostly through illegal hunting. This, in the long run, proves fortunate: hunting has given her the skill set she needs to fight off 23 other semi-feral teens in the annual "Hunger Games".  Not satisfied with just crushing the districts physically, the Capitol demands human sacrifice as well - 2 teens from each district are brought in every year and forced to fight to the death. It's not just brutal reprisal, it's entertainment!  The majority of the book takes place inside the game itself. Katniss can't get just away with surviving - she also needs to make a series of increasingly difficult moral decisions regarding her fellow combatants. Some are one-dimensional and utterly loathsome (fire away!), others have more complex motivation (and even names!), making it harder for Katniss to rationalize their murder.  Katniss is a strong character (if slightly dense when it comes to personal interaction). The action is good - I'm not sure there's ever any doubt about who is going to win, but Collins still keeps things tense. When it comes down to it, I'd be much more impressed if it all hadn't been done before.  Battle Royale, the 1999 novel (first in English in 2003) by Koushon Takami is about a futuristic, dystopian government that randomly kidnaps children and forces them to fight to the death for the entertainment of the masses. Initially a book, it was adapted into a manga series and a popular cult film.  Takami's book has the same moral ambiguity, the same teen romantic struggles and the same horrific violence. It also has the same dystopian, omnipotent government, maneuvering behind the scenes. (Including the same ending - in which the conflict escalates from the physical arena to a political one.) But where Takami's book veers towards the artistic - a sparse writing style that uses violence to emphasize the surreal horror of the situation - Collins' The Hunger Games is more story-driven.  Ms Collins cites a variety of influences for The Hunger Games - including Greek mythology - but not Takashi's book. I'm certainly not accusing her of plagiarism. It is merely a question of stylistic difference - two authors telling a very similar story in a very different way.  I prefer Takashi's 1999 work, but I can understand why a young adult publisher (and, trusting their expertise, a young adult audience as well) would be more drawn to the safer option of Collins' version. The Hunger Games is a fairly respectable book, but the unmitigated enthusiasm surrounding it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Battle Royale, unsurprisingly, is now back in print - I recommend that other readers take the chance to make their own comparisons.
It's been said by previous reviewers, and probably in better words, but I'ma say it again.  The first book is super fast-paced and an easy - and engaging - read. But I think it's bad literature.  The setting of a dystopian society wherein children are pitted against one another to the death in an annual melee ABSOLUTELY BEGS for a strong moral message. A message of humanity, hope, compassion, the darkness AND the lightness in each person, forgiveness, sacrifice, redemption... And the call is completely unanswered. There is no moral message that comes through, not for the characters and not for the readers.  I read and read, waiting for the characters to develop, to come to understandings, to break through and open up and help us, the readers, realize along with them that even if things are bleak and wretched there can be hope, we can still maintain our dignity and humanity and compassion.  We can learn from our mistakes. We can be the better person. We can overcome.  Nope! Suzanne Collins instead makes the reader part of the audience to a sad and violent reality show where we're super excited and horrified to see who's gunna git killed next. The story is dark and depressing and shallow. Aaaand poorly written.  The crazy-hard moral dilemma of our would-be heroine Katniss - in which she must kill or be killed - should REALLY bring out some character-building, impossibly complex ethical predicaments, right? Again, no. When Katniss kills another child in the arena, we always feel that he really deserved it. He was an a-hole. He was dangerous.  We all love us some good old fashioned black-and-white characters. Bad guys are always easy to kill. When Katniss begins to like one of her opponents and frets over the "one of us is going to have to kill the other" situation, the other character is killed off by one of the bad guys. Whew. Glad we didn't have to face that one. How frickin' convenient. And how horribly shallow and irresponsible. Instead of really digging into the obvious issue of "Dude, these are a bunch of kids fighting to the death for an audience and that's super horrible", Collins makes the fighting itself the focus and intrigue, rather than a platform from which to tackle real, deep issues.  Ugh. I just wanted these books to be so much more. But they weren't.
After getting recommendations from so many people that I lost count I decided to downloaded this book and I have to say I hate the people who recommended it to me. I am aghast the praise these books are getting. The story has a weird pace where nothing happens for dozens of pages and then within a few paragraphs all is said and done. I attributed some of the lack of depth to the fact that this is young adult fiction but it just does not stack up against many of the books in the genre.  There is little or no introspection, both from the author or any of the characters, they are petulant short sighted and whiny. (Spoiler?) Katniss goes from being horrified that she has to leave her family to maybe starve to "Oooh what a pretty dress" in the space of a few hours. She likes to sleep with Peeta but their relationship is purely platonic. Is it just me or does someone else find it hard to believe two teenagers don't really act that way. Both Peeta and Gale are perceptually in love with Katniss though its hard to see why, she is dull, manipulative and self-serving and obviously so.  The rules of the games are arbitrary and seem like they were made up as the author went along to suit the particular plot device she wanted to use at that point. Maybe I am too used to Tolkien and Asminov where the integrity and consistency of the universe in which their books reside is more important than the current plot twist. Also I recently read the Game of Thrones series where the characters are multidimensional, introspective and actually change radically during the course of the story. I read this book and wept for more Starks and Lanisters.  However even if you overlook all of the problems I have mentioned so far the writing of this book is abysmal. The use of first person for the whole book is annoying, over-use of dialog for trivial conversation and over use of adjectives makes it boring to read. The crude and forced revolutionary overtones are just painful to read and any social commentary about the current reality television fad is accidental. Its more a product of the reality TV era and if it is possible this book is even more shallow and crude that the reality television programs it seeks to provide commentary on.
The intrinsic horror of the Hunger Games has been reviewed by other readers.  Yes, it is sick and awful that kids are forced to kill each other and that it is televised, but when you stand back and look at the book in a detached way, it's really rather ridiculous.  The world building just doesn't make sense.  First of all, the reason given for the Capitol's stranglehold on the Districts is that there are no resources.  Everyone is starving.  The sea has covered the land.  The environment has gone to hell.  People are so desperate that they're throwing their kids into the pot as human sacrifices.  And they're mining coal.  Repeat: THEY'RE MINING COAL.  If resources are so scare, how is there any coal to mine?  If things are that bad, the coal should be long gone.  Plus, our heroine hunts outside the fence in what appears to be a thriving ecosystem: plenty of predators, prey, virgin forest and clean water.  Isn't the environment supposed to be wiped out?  Speaking of which, if things are so bad on the inside of the fence and so good on the outside, why hasn't everyone--or, at least, some--escaped the Districts and set up an alternative society in the forest?  The Capitol seems to have some serious technological advantages, and it better had, because in real life, the nation of Panem would be under constant attack.  Other countries seem strangely absent in this version of the future, which is plain odd, but I guess it's a good thing, since other countries would have seen Panem as a weak target long ago and attacked it.  If resources are scarce, people fight over them; and Panem is wasting tons of its resources by sinking them into the pointless Hunger Games EVERY YEAR.  Every SINGLE year, they are spending the equivalent of millions of dollars on terrorizing their citizens, creating the Arena and making zombie werewolves (seriously).  The Hunger Games do nothing to stimulate any part of the economy but reality TV; they do nothing to defend the country.  The ONLY purpose they serve is entertainment and terrorism.  Any other country, in a world as brutal as Collins', would have long ago ransacked Panem, which, spending all its resources on state terror, would be unable to fight back.  In real life, Panem would not be wasting valuable soldiers on gladiatorial fights, not when they could be shipping them off to defend the borders.  The sheer emotional horror of this book is good, and, I know, the main point.  But the world makes no sense when you leave your fantasy of the Ultimate Evil Reality TV Show and take a long, hard look at it.
Out of the many who gave The Hunger Games rave reviews, mine is only fair.  Why?  This genre of book is not for everybody.  As a reader I felt like I was always at the mercy of an overbearing, controlling and cruel "Big Brother" type figure who on impulse would make really  ludicrous things happen to the characters in their fight 'till death competition.  Just when events in the story were about to make sense,  something crazy like mad dogs reincarnated from formerly dead players would be thrown into the plot.  There was no reason for it.  The characters all seemed to be missing a personality.  The heroine lacked emotion.  Her reaction to kissing a boy for the first time lacked in everything and made it rather dull.  I found myself feeling weary and annoyed from all the unlimited bad things that were uncontrollably going wrong.
One of my only reviews I've ever put on here, but this book is nothing more than entertaining escape fiction.  Is it dystopian?  Sure.  But comparing this to 1984, Brave New World, or Fahrenheit 451 is an insult.  There is simply no legitimate description of WHY the world in this novel exists outside of a few boilerplate pages.  Not to mention, once the game starts (half way through or so) the author drops any real attempt to parallel the dystopia with current society -- in other words, it's just an action novel.  The characters were flat with the exception of the heroine, and the author's attempt at creating even a faux love for survival were lame.  I would compare this to the first Harry Potter novel, but it at least created an alternative world with consistency and detail.  The Hunger Games is more-or-less 6th grade action fiction with enough violence and innuendo to make it to Hollywood.  Sadly, I expect the movie to be better than the book.
Before you start down the long path of reading this series, pay close attention to the fact that the last book--Mockingjay--has received much weaker reviews than the first two books. That may not seem to matter now, but believe me--it will when you get there. The Hunger Games series is entertaining, but ultimately it leads nowhere. I won't tell you how the story ends, but I will say that any insight, redemption, or spirit that this book may promise will never arrive.  It is an empty tale. It's charming but vacant. It settles on the tongue like cotton candy, but never reaches your stomach. It will indeed leave you hungry: hungry for a story with some humanity, some depth. For that, try The Lord of the Rings, or the Chronicles of Narnia, or Harry Potter. The Hunger Games is not even in their league.  I regret spending my time on these books. I did enjoy them, most of the time, but in the end I like my stories to be more than cheap thrills and action. I like my action to have a heart beating beneath it. If you do too, keep browsing.
This book has so many reviews, I didn't intend to write one. As it is, I'll skip the plot introduction and setup and go straight to my thoughts.  Without a doubt, this book is a page-turner. Indeed, the same is true of the whole trilogy; I blew through all three books in a weekend. And it was a great ride. I liked Katniss well enough, and while I was reading I was certainly invested in the tale.  In retrospect, though, this trilogy was compelling to me mostly because it's so fast-paced and action-driven. Not that that's the only thing it has going for it: Collins does a good job of developing the society, there are some intriguing plot elements and I liked the angle the book takes with the romance (in the first book, at least). And I liked that the book doesn't make out-of-place references to our current society or give infodumps on what happened between the modern day and its futuristic setting. But already, looking back on the trilogy I'm underwhelmed. So, a few of the problems:  - The characterization is a bit iffy. I liked Katniss, but she didn't ever feel like a real teenager (except maybe in the third book). Peeta is sometimes sweet, but way too perfect. Gale seemed interesting, but we never saw much of him. The secondary characters aren't awful, but there just isn't much here that's memorable.  - The premise seems specially created to give the characters serious moral dilemmas. Only, the book neatly avoids those dilemmas. The setup seems to require Katniss to kill basically nice people in order to survive.... the actual plot sidesteps that.  - Speaking of the plot: a bit too gimmicky for my taste. I'd like less reliance on monsters and magical obstacle courses and such, and more conflict arising from the characters themselves. Your mileage may vary. The first book isn't too bad about this, but there's more and more of it as the trilogy continues.  - And speaking of the setup. I simply never bought that forcing a couple dozen randomly-selected teenage (and younger) boys and girls to kill each other on national TV would be a good PR move for any government. Especially with all the efforts to humanize them--the pre-Games interviews, having viewers witness every moment of their struggles, strength and suffering, interviewing their families and friends, and so on. I bought that the Districts had to accept this because they were oppressed. I didn't buy the people in the Capitol thinking this was all good fun.  - Finally, I could never figure out why, when there are so few people left in the world, they'd confine themselves to such small areas. District 12 only has 8000 people (the size of a small town) and seems to be the only settlement in all of Appalachia. So, why does everyone live within a fenced-in area as if this was a zombie book? Wild animals (the reason given in the book) didn't necessitate such a drastic response from either the Native Americans or the original European settlers, so I assumed it was a political ploy to keep the people under control.... but that didn't make a lot of sense either. With such abundant land and natural resources, why would the government want to keep the population small, starving and with little to lose when it could instead take credit for a growing population and improved standards of living as they made use of the surrounding area? And would controlling a wider area really be a problem for a government that already exercises such tight control over such vast distances? Presumably they're already capable of controlling it, or dissenters would just run off into the wilderness and create their own societies? This is simply never addressed.  Anyway, this trilogy is entertaining enough, but if somebody asked me to recommend an exciting series about teenagers fighting a bad government, I'd recommend Marsden's Tomorrow series before I'd recommend this.
Let me first start off by saying that this isn't a bashfest review. I was honestly taken aback by the all the praise this book received. It received a lot of publicity because Stephenie Meyer recommended it, but that doesn't necessarily mean it was a fantastic read.  It was a decent read. It was a something-to-do read. But I found it in no way as amazing as it was played up to be when I purchased it. I found this book to be written somewhat childishly, overcompensating for that fact by crazy, lame character names. Katniss? Primrose? Gale? Peeta? Glimmer? I understand that this novel is set in futuristic once-North America, but the names set my first impressions throughout the book, and I just could not get past that.  I also, at times, found Katniss's voice to be somewhat unbelievable and juvenile--I found it hard to believe she was sixteen when her voice sometimes reminded me of a twelve or eleven year old. This disappointed me because, in the beginning before the Games, she did seem much older than that.  SPOILERS:  Finally, I found the love triangle to be somewhat meaningless. Gale receives a chapter or two in the beginning, and a few periodic mentionings throughout the book, but all we really know about him is that he hates the Capitol, likes to hunt, and is the school heartthrob. I felt a little cheated that Katniss decided that she wasn't sure she could choose between Peeta and Gale, after all she and Peeta went through. Perhaps this triangle would have felt more solid to me had Gale been given more time to establish himself in the beginning.  Overall, I really do not regret that I read this book and I don't feel like it was a waste of my money. It gave me something other than school material to read, and I enjoyed escaping to the total unreality of it sometimes. But, in the end, I wasn't too impressed with it as a whole.
An obviously enjoyable book, judging from the rave critics reviews and movie release, but empty, formulaic, predictable and cliche'.  1) The characters are not faced with truly moral decisions, the bad guys are bad, the good guys are good, and the main character never encounters a moral dilemma. I hoped that the plot device would give an opportunity to explore human nature, virtue, courage, desperation etc. But it fails. There is no valid exploration of human nature.  2) As mentioned by many others, the plot is derived from "Battle Royale" Not a problem in itself, except that "Hunger Games" fails to adequately justify its plot devices.  3) The convenience of medicines that magically appear, and rules that spontaneously change do not lend to a suspension of disbelief. These events are contrived.  4) It would have been much more enjoyable not to work in a love story.  5) Whatever social commentary the author strives for, it is utterly lost. The dystopian society of the "Hunger Games" is so alien that there is little in the book that lends to reflection.  6) Reviews praise her writing style, but she uses many cliche's and fails to paint an original vivid narration.  7) None of the characters truly contemplate the moral outrage of the central plot device. This is the elephant in the room. Even in Roman times, the merits of the arena were debated.  With that said, I can believe that she intentionally paints her characters as shallow, one-dimentional, insecure and media-obsessed (Katniss is always worried about how people will perceive her "performance" in the hunger games) as a means to lambast the idiocy of reality television. There is a veiled allegory of how television viewers in the United States are entertained by watching people exploit themselves on national television. The lack of any truly deep questioning by any of the characters is in some way reflective of how television viewers today don't have any moral compunction about viewing similarly exploitive reality television.  In short, throughout the whole book I hoped it would redeem itself in some way. It failed to do so. I jumped on the bandwagon because my friends were all about it, but will need some persuasion to read the sequels.
The Hunger Games would be much more palatable if this story were original.  It is not.  I read Battle Royale a few years ago and greatly enjoyed the entire experience.  I'm a high school teacher, and my students have been raving about The Hunger Games.  While I was aware of the comparison to Battle Royale I thought I'd give the story a try, wanting to judge it on its own merits.  I came away sorely disappointed.  The storyline is virtually identical to that of Battle Royale.  This is concerning for two reasons.  First, it is glaringly unoriginal.  Throughout the story, I kept hoping for the plots of the two books to diverge onto separate paths.  This did not happen in any sustained way.  The political environment, the setup in the arena, the writing about the Games, the love story, they have all been written before and given much more articulate and compelling treatment.  Second, it is written in an inferior manner to Royale.  I could forgive the "plot inspiration" were the author to exhibit exceptional literary skill.  Unfortunately, Ms. Collins disappoints.  In fairness, the one element that I appreciated from Games was the preparation process.  This diverged to a significant degree from Royale's plot, and made me quite hopeful for the arena.  I sped through those pages hoping for more originality, yet, found none.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the arena scene, virtually two-thirds of the book, fails to offer the main character any moral dilemma.  This frustrated me to a great degree.  The author constructed a story arc with which she could really play with morality and emotion.  Instead she included a contrived, poorly written, and uninspired love story.  The main character feels, in this reviewer's opinion, almost a bystander to the main conflict.  Now, I'm not a young adult, but as a teacher of young adults I find the acclaim of such a one dimensional work truly frightening.  While I'm excited to see young people reading anything (anything is better than no reading), I feel that their age group is missing out on something more.  For those young people discovering reading, the premise of the story is irresistible.  Sadly, the conclusion of the story leaves me wishing that I had reread Battle Royale.  This could have been a novel headed for the English cannon.  Instead, it will go the way of the Twilight series, fading into irrelevance, as its readers mature.
When Katniss Everdeen finds herself a contestant in the annual Hunger Games, she considers herself a goner. Out of 24 teenaged contestants chosen from the 12 districts of Panem, only 1 will emerge victorious. The rest will be slaughtered. By each other. And the entire event will be televised from the Capitol for the entire nation to watch.  If you had described the basic plot of the Hunger Games to me and told me that it was going to be THE book to read in 2008, I probably would have raised an eyebrow. Futuristic? And dystopian? AND gladiatorial? Despite the seemingly disparate elements, Suzanne Collins somehow managed to hit upon the perfect combination in this thrilling story about a girl who lives in a nation obsessed with violence and reality television. There is action, romance, deception, humans hunting humans (Most Dangerous Game, anyone?) surgically altered stylists (reminiscent of Scott Westerfeld's Uglies), genetically enhanced mutants, a cruel totalitarian government, and a unspoken mandatory creed to treat the entire event as if it were a holiday.  I read Hunger Games from start to finish in a day while I was supposed to be studying for finals. I meant to read a chapter or two and then go back to work, but I just could not put it down. Hunger Games is the kind of book that continues to haunt you days and weeks after you've turned the final page. I absolutely recommend it to everyone, with the one caveat that it does feature brutal violence between children and is perhaps not for the faint of heart. The next book can't come fast enough! In the mean time, I'm going to go learn how to shoot a bow, you never know when you're going to need to know how!
Unless you've been living under a rock for the past five or six years, you already know that THE HUNGER GAMES has been a publishing and motion picture phenomenon. The book itself is a fast-paced, nail-biting, extremely compelling read, with an extraordinary premise and the kind of gritty, underdog characters that easily capture the reader's interest and emotions. But there is something more going on here, something that I dearly hope readers will take the time and effort to truly comprehend. If you are willing to actually scratch the surface of THE HUNGER GAMES, you will see it bleed.  The feeling that there was something important that kept narrowly but consistently evading me dogged me throughout the book. At first, I thought it was just that there is something uniquely and profoundly chilling about watching a child deliberately hunt down and kill another child. That aspect of the book made me feel dirty, like someone who should be respectfully averting their gaze from a gruesome car crash but couldn't quite tear their eyes away. That was part of it, but it wasn't all of it. Next, I thought the thing that kept nagging at the edges of my mind had something to do with the grotesqueness of these young human sacrifices being first primped, pampered, and made into beautiful and desirable celebrities before being fed to the wolves. The cult of celebrity is something I abhor, and I could see in THE HUNGER GAMES a very apt and poignant allegory for the way in which young celebrities in particular are "eaten alive" by the entertainment industry. Yes, this was also part of it, but it still wasn't all of it.  It wasn't until I read a short interview with the author at the end of the book that the final piece fell into place. In this interview, Suzanne Collins described what had first given her the idea for a story that became THE HUNGER GAMES. She had been sleepily channel surfing late one night and kept flipping back and forth between the images of a reality TV show in which children were competing for prizes or prestige and the images of a news report on child soldiers, an appallingly real condition that exists in many parts of our world today, in which children are forced to become soldiers fighting real wars against each other. That was when I finally realized exactly what I had found so unsettling about reading this book. It wasn't just the disturbing IDEA of children killing each other, it wasn't just what the book had to say, ALLEGORICALLY, about the ruthlessness of the cult of celebrity. No, what really made my skin crawl and my mind shrink back defensively as I read was the apparently subconscious knowledge that THE HUNGER GAMES IS NOT FICTION.  The characters of this book may be invented, the plot of this book may be invented, the book may be set several centuries in the future, but the conditions under which this story develops are right here, right now. In THE HUNGER GAMES, some of the child sacrifices have trained their whole lives for the competition and enter it almost willingly, whereas others are simply forced to compete and enter the arena feeling nothing but terror. In some parts of our world, children compete in what they view as a willing manner for status, image, and celebrity, whereas in other parts of our world, children are kidnapped, contained in a certain area, and forced to either kill each other or be killed. These things are not fiction, these things are happening all day, every day. They're happening as you read this. They're happening as you wake up in the morning. They're still happening as you go to sleep at night.  It's easy to read THE HUNGER GAMES with a chill running down your spine at the thought of children fighting to the death - for status or simply for their lives - but the reassuring thought in the back of your mind that "It's just a story." But as I finally came to realize, the most important thing about THE HUNGER GAMES is that it's NOT just a story. It's a very timely warning that at every moment, in every part of the world, we are allowing our children to be exploited in the most brutal, gruesome, and shameful ways imaginable - ways so shameful, in fact, that we can really only face up to them when they are presented to us in the guise of fiction.
This book could have been so much more.  The dystopian future is interesting enough, the characters are decently developed, and the plot is far darker than most YA dramas.  Yet Collins refuses to take the step into truly deep moral debates.  Never is there an actual delima in the killing of other Tributes; it's always good versus evil until the very end.  Never does there feel like the Games are actually destroying the humanity of the participants.  When the ending finally does arrive, there is no horrible acts done for the greater good, no debate over the cost of rebellion to those who have no say in the matter, only an idiotic love-based decision to defy the game's rules.  While the gamble pays off, you are left scratching your head going "really, this is what they decided to do?"  If Kat had taken the next step and gone down a darker path, or if more of the other Tributes had souls, the book itself would have led us towards moral debates rather than only leave you wondering "what if" while the obligatory love triangle begins.  Sadly, this book will fade in a few decades rather than forever be installed in anals of literature as a masterpiece of socio-philosophical debate.  For all the enjoyment of a nice light read, truly a disappointment.
This story was truly life changing. The premise of the story alone is enough for anyone to realize this will not be your run of the mill young adult novel.  Katniss and Peeta's story is amazing. How two children can be sent to compete against other kids knowing the likelihood of them surviving is minimal at best is enough to make any reader lose their breath. Then the relationship development between these two characters really puts the icing on the cake. The story was so well written, I was literally in tears to the point where I thought I couldn't continue any further, yet I still refused to put the book down. On the flip side, there were moments I was grinning like a Cheshire cat. Therefore, if you don't want people to think you're losing your mind you may want to find a nice quiet room to read in because you may not be able to control your emotions when reading this story.  Though both main characters were inspiring to me, Peeta was really the standout character within the story. As the son of a baker, he comes off as one of the most unlikely players to make it through the first few minutes of the hunger games. He may not be the strongest or best with weapons, but he has an inner strength and resolution that really makes you rally behind him.  As if creating exciting main characters wasn't enough, the supporting cast Ms. Collins brings in are just as remarkable. For example, Rue and Cinna are two characters I felt could have had their own stories. They had a star quality. I was eagerly anticipating the next scene to include them. These are only two of the wonderful characters that grace the pages and I am sure you will fall in love with each and every one of them.  I have recommended this book to numerous people including my daughter. She was captivated to the point that she brought the book to read during lunch and recess in school. While this book may not be appropriate for children under twelve due to its dark themes, it is certainly worth an adult's time to read and then decide whether to share with their child.

Either Katniss is a perpetual liar/unreliable narrator, or lobotomies were free for most characters.  #1. The hungry ignore how she gets food. Katniss says she's one of few who hunt--the rest haven't learnt archery or spear-throwing or fishing. They aren't desperate enough to creep outside the fence, where it's brimming with food and life. "Roots to dig, greens to gather, fish..." And even a strawberry patch! If Katniss' father--a regular coal miner--became a good hunter, why didn't the starving masses copy him?  #2. Katniss' dad would've made them rich. The food he'd fetched would have made him a lot wealthier than a miner, so WHY was he still mining, instead of hunting full-time?  #3. Hunger doesn't drive these people to boldness? "Even though trespassing in the woods is illegal and carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it if they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture out with just a knife." (Pg 6). But the Peacekeepers "protect" successful hunters instead of punishing (shooting) them, and Prehistoric men turned sharpened sticks into spears to hunt and defend against sabre-tooth tigers! Desperate people would hunt like this to feed their children, or even with pitchforks. It's 74 years since the Games started, and hunting/gathering outside is STILL rare?  #4. Animals (meat) are safe inside D12? Katniss tells us there's a lot of livestock INSIDE District 12 and that all are apparently safe from being stolen and roasted. Pigs (Peeta's), goats (Prim's &amp; Goat Man's herd), cattle (the soup lady will tell the Peacemakers her soup is beef), horses (to pull the wagons), sheep (Katniss trades for wool), and enough leather for shoes, jackets, etc. Yep, starved coal miners and orderly teens limp past Prim's goat on their way home to their starving families every night and ignore it!  #5. Everyone's a lawbreaker, but they're terrified of breaking the law? The reason Katniss gives for the above is that it's against the law to steal, the punishment being death, which would be scary if they weren't being killed slowly, anyway. And she *also* says, "...and who hasn't broken the law?" Whiplash! Which is it? 200 years ago in England, the poor knew they'd be sentenced to death or shipped to hard labour in Australia for being caught stealing bread or hunting on private property, but hunger twisted their arms.  #6. Starving people don't make their own veggie gardens? Outside the fence are potatoes, carrots, beets, parsnips, turnips (roots), berry bushes, leafy green veg, herbs and strawberries, all growing hardily without human nurturing, so the seeds/cuttings are right there to cultivate from! Pg.34 has Peeta's yard with a "garden bed, not yet planted for the spring" and Pg.42 K's hungry mother grows herbs, so growing food is legal in D.12 and no one is persecuted in any way for it. Why isn't the whole of D12 swollen in greenery from these hardy crops?  #7. Katniss is well-fed but hungry, poor but sells what everyone wants? She says she still goes to bed hungry at times, so hungry she's needed to put her name in the Hunger Games hat extra times every year for grain and oil. Yet she *also* says their goat (her "gold mine"!) provides so much milk for them to drink that they occasionally have enough left over to make cheese, and that she brings food, including meat, home on a daily basis (Pg.377).  #8. Miners that keep the Capital running on coal are so hungry they can't mine? If the above is true, then miners go to bed even HUNGRIER than Katniss, every SINGLE night, thus they're seriously frail, endangering D.12's ability to dig coal for their overlords = the main theme is a PLOT HOLE!  #9. The Capitol doesn't care about production? A place of technology and comfort, they use electricity (from coal) to maintain that lifestyle. Understandable. The other districts would also be heavy electricity users for their different productions, so coal would be in VERY high demand since no other fuel is being produced. Wouldn't PRODUCTION be the overlords supreme goal? Fear of the Capitol is a done-deal already, since all children must have their names in the hat for the Hunger Games. So the Capitol doesn't have to shoot itself in the foot by having workers who can barely walk in order to maintain control.  #10. Miners with serious illnesses keep the Capitol running? Living mostly on grains and oil would mean these precious workers are severely deficient in Vit.C = scurvy (weakness, anemia, bleeding organs, heart disease), folic acid (anemia, irritability, memory problems, manic depression, bone fractures, low libido, fetal problems) and iron (fatigue, difficulty maintaining body temperature, decreased immune function, anemia). HOW ARE THEY REPRODUCING, let alone working?  11. Given the laws of supply and demand, Katniss would be wealthy. She is one of just a few who are selling the rarest and most desired product to eight thousand people (including the wealthier Peacekeepers) who are all desperate for her meat. However, she trades this commodity that's hundreds of times more valuable than the meat in our stores today, for shoelaces, wool, bread or salt. Lobotomy! Even the organs/heads/feet would fetch high prices! Her mother, being a supposed healer, should know that broth made from boiling fish-heads is an iodine-rich remedy for energy/illnesses, and boiled bones/hooves makes a gelatine and mineral rich broth that boosts the immune system, is an anti-inflammatory, a hormone regulator, and for skin and joint/tendon health. The people in D.12 would *greatly* need these remedies!  #12. Where does she find the time? Every day, Katniss goes to school, hunts in the mountains, sells/trades her extra food in the Hob (where she "makes most of her money") and (I assume) guts and skins her kill for her mother to cook.  #13. The overloads care about schooling the kids (up to 16, at least) they starve and deny futures to. The Capitol pay teachers and other staff while providing classrooms, "sports activities" (Pg.13), and "music assembly" (Pg.366) for children who could otherwise be mining. Poor kids as young as 4, in the Victorian era, were uneducated and mined coal under a MUCH less sinister government. "Somehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides basic reading and maths, most of our instruction is coal related." Why do non-mining kids, like the Mayor's daughter &amp; Peeta, have to know all about it? Why do future miners even need to know anything about coal that can't be taught on-the-job? Moreover, why do *they* need to be taught even basic reading and maths by their evil overlords?  #14. Or ARE good futures produced from this schooling? Katniss lectures Prim about staying in school on page 42, as if it can improve Prim's future, as if it's a choice Prim has not to go. Yet this is supposed to be a place where mining coal is people's main avenue for income...after the age of 16/17.  #14. Why didn't Katniss give Prim advice to help her life without her? "Prim, forget school that'll get your nowhere. Make and tend a big vegetable garden of berries, greens and roots. That'll be your carbs, so you don't need to enter the Hunger Games for grain rations! Mom, teach Prim reading and maths, and tend the garden with her. Gale, can you trap some baby rabbits for them to breed their own, easy meat in cages over grass?" (since no one would steal them). "With the money you get from selling extra food, buy more goats to sell milk and cheese, too." In fact, why weren't they doing all this all along? Why weren't others? Ah, those darned lobotomies!  #15. Did I miss a law for dark haired, grey-eyed people to mine, or else? What about all the other jobs needed in D12? The majority of D.12 are supposed to be coal miners who get paid very little for their hard, dangerous work, yet there's plenty of other jobs they could do (and that would NEED doing! So...each new generation of coal miners choose not to be meat-hunters, bakers, butchers, teachers, prostitutes, pub staff, Moonshine producers, grave-diggers, police/peacekeepers, staff of the Mayor, fruit growers &amp; dryers (raisins on Pg. 37), hide-tanners (all that leather), fabric producers &amp; dyers (for pretty dresses, "pink" ribbons, trousers, blouses, babies' diapers, sanitary pads, etc--What do they make it from? Cotton? Hemp?), cotton/hemp farmers (unless these starving people can afford to import all that in), animal farmers (pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, horses), wagon builders (pg.48), clothes washers, wool spinners, makers/importers of school &amp; office supplies (paper, pencils, chalk, text books?), herbalists/healers (Katniss' mother), soap or toothbrush producers, black-market businesses, carpenters, plumbers, electricity company workers, electricians, electric bulb &amp; wire &amp; switch manufacturers, steel workers (knives, fences, pots, ovens, nails, sewing needles), guards for herds of livestock?, shoe/boot-makers, garbage men (rubbish bin's emptied on Pg.34), etc, etc.  #16. The Capitol called the games "HUNGER" yet they don't want any of the hungry to believe any of them are so hungry they actually die from hunger. HUH? Pg. 33: "Starvation is never the cause of death officially. It's always the flu, or exposure to pneumonia. But that fools no one."  #17. Which district pumps oil? The amount of fuel to make and transport all these products of "industries" back and forth across the country means fuel needs are immense. They have hovercrafts, trucks, tractors and trains... I thought the trains, at least, must've been coal-produced-electric (given their high speeds), but then the train on page 540 stopped for "fuel"! Not even trains today do that (electric). Soooooooooo...?  #18. THE WRITING.  So many adverbs. So many cliches ("silent as a stone" + "fresh as a raindrop" + "chilled to the bone" + "shaking like a leaf"). So may dialogue tags. If it's just two people in a conversation, we know who's speaking after the first dialogue tag/action beat! This drove me nuts:  "Yes, there's usually some," I say.  "Katniss, it's just hunting. You're the best hunter I know," says Gale.  "It's not just hunting. They're armed. They think," I say.  "So do you. And you've had more practice. Real practice," he says. "You know how to kill."  "Not people," I say.  "How different can it be, really?" says Gale grimly.  THE GOOD...................................  Indeed, I thought there were a lot of good things in tHG, despite all the above. I really liked the author's prose and pacing. The "little duck" comments in the beginning with Prim were so cute and creative, I was drawn in right away. And the cat and her hating each other got my attention as well--very unique. I loved the creativity in how simply the author wrote, "Entrails. No hissing. It's the closest we'll come to love." These are what spurred me to click "buy now" ASAP. Loved having a strong female lead who wasn't bitchy or whinny! I think this confuses a lot of writers who aim for strong, but Katniss was created with talent. The rare trope/pairing of "Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy" made the read more interesting, and I think that, too, took talent to pull off. The characters of Gale and Prim were my favourites, and I got teary just reading the Kindle sample where Katniss substituted herself in Prim's place. After the sample is where it went down-hill for me--leaving district 12 and the characters I was most invested in.  Personally, I would have found it a fascinating read without the Hunger Games, but rather a story of how they cope in District 12 (minus lobotomies!), how their survival progresses and how their relationships grow and are challenged in that interesting setting.
Suzanne Collins will blow your mind with this fantastic read. The main plot is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen. When her sister's name is picked for the 74th annual Hunger Games, Katniss knows that her sister is too weak to compete. Katniss is forced to join a competition where you fight to stay alive in an arena with the most extreme living conditions. They must live for several weeks without any resources. The last person left alive wins. Will Katniss rise to the expectations from District Twelve or will she fall under the standards and lose her life to the deadliest place throughout all of the districts? Suzanne Collins wrote an award winning novel that deserves more appraisal then it has received. If you are interested in a GREAT read and very interesting book, The Hunger Games is a great thriller and adrenaline rush.  ~CB~
I admit that I wasn't too excited when my book club picked this book as our next read. I'd heard just enough about the plot to make me nervous. Kids killing each other, really? I'm supposed to read this for entertainment?  I gave it a chance, and found it to be a riveting and compelling read. Violence is integral to the plot, but it's not gruesome or drawn out. This is no celebration of violence, but rather a story about what it means to be human in the face of violence.  I left with a deep emotional attachment to the characters, and a concern for their welfare living under a government  that keeps its society in check by forcing children into a life-and-death struggle on live TV. Questions are raised about the dehumanizing effect on the audience of watching these gladiator-like games -- apt questions in our world of reality TV shows.  Parents, certainly this is one to read and discuss alongside your son or daughter. But I would rank it as similar to the later Harry Potter books in terms of intensity and violence. This is a dystopia, so it's meant to be disturbing, but the tone is similar to The Giver -- not Brave New World.
First off, I must admit that I am far beyond my teen years and, for some, that may explain "it" (my discordant review). Having never read any of Suzanne Collins's works, I had no expectations as to her literary prowess, style, or, if it exists, the purpose (apart from mercenary considerations) of her writings. I chose to read Hunger Games (Kindle edition) because many independent sources liken it to Harry Potter, which I thoroughly enjoyed (the books, not the movies). Indeed, an oft repeated refrain is, "If you liked Harry Potter, you'll love Hunger Games." Really? You be the judge . . . .  For those with limited time and patience, I will summarize my review, now, by saying that I believe Hunger Games to be a vacuous story expressly written to a vacuous (ergo, undiscriminating) audience. If one reads some of the negative reviews, one finds the question (in various forms), "What is there about Hunger Games that teens find awesome?" The unequivocal answer is that which applies to the appeal of today's entertainment media: action, special effects, but no story! I think it safe to say that teens are more excitable than they are pensive, more superficial than introspective, and more easily entertained than challenged - and that may explain the popularity of Hunger Games. It is precisely akin to first person shooter games: you blow things up, kill the survivors, and move on to the next level with the profound observation, "Whew, that was close!"  Hunger Games is written in the first person point of view, i.e., EVERYTHING that happens is seen from Katniss's viewpoint. The problem that issues from this POV in Hunger Games is, essentially, that there is no development of any other character because one cannot get into their heads - other than what Katniss allows; unfortunately, being rather self-absorbed, she does not allow for much and one is left with a teen autobiography that could have been exhausted in one chapter. As in first person shooter games, other characters are, for the most, to be spared or killed and what, if anything, they think, say, or feel is beside the point.  It should be no surprise that Hunger Games progresses slowly because it is bereft of a captivating or interesting story: one blows things up, kills the survivors and moves on to the next challenge - the interim between challenges being filled with uninteresting reminisces or asides that are non sequiturs, at best. I dare say most people (teens) could read only the "action" sequences, skip the rest, and finish the book having missed nothing - all in one chapter.  Interestingly, as reviewer Alex pointed out, you know that Katniss is going to survive the games because (1) she had to survive to tell the story and, (2) she has to be around to relate the sequel. Here one might point out that the same is true for Harry Potter. Yes . . . but, in the Sorcerer's Stone, one is not told in the first chapter that, in the events that immediately follow, only one will survive - a theme that, coincidently, J.K. Rowling artfully develops over the course of seven volumes.  Finally, I share the observation and, indeed, the concern of others, that Hunger Games lacks a moral definitive or imperative; more than one chapter of kill or be killed in the abstract gnaws at the fibers of my core, which I find intolerable. As I stated, however, that is precisely what first person shooter games are about - and nothing more. Life is inconsequential.  I found nothing in Hunger Games akin to Harry Potter; indeed, I found nothing at all redeeming in Hunger Games. Perhaps I was too distracted: while reading Hunger Games, all I could think about was The Predator.  Ed
I read the both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire a couple years back, before Mockingjay had come out and long before this  (undeserved) hype had started. I've always been an avid reader, so when I stumbled upon it at the library and it looked interesting, of course I took it home. Like anyone, I found the story fast-paced and compellingly told, but I didn't like much else about it. After I finished the two, they quickly left my mind, making no impression on me.  I only just got around to reading Mockingjay last week (I can't stand not to finish a series once I start), amidst the inexplicable amount of excitement about the series and the upcoming movie. Upon finishing it I made the decision, once again, that the Hunger Games is not a good series.  I have rarely encountered a character I dislike as much as I dislike Katniss. A comparison that comes to mind is Harry Potter's Professor Umbridge--and even then it's a different situation, because you aren't expected to root for Umbridge, while Katniss is the main character and the narrator of this trilogy. Katniss is cold, selfish, entirely self-serving, oblivious to the kindness of others, brash, vengeful, and truly cares about no one. All this, and in all three books I failed to see any character growth. She badly mistreats her mother, Peeta, and Gale throughout the series (and yet, Peeta and Gale both follow her like puppy dogs--this makes absolutely no sense as she has no redeeming qualities) and, although several times realizes it, does nothing to rectify her actions. Sickening, truly. Perhaps the best example of Katniss' absolute lack of character is at the end of Mockingjay when she votes "yes" for a final Hunger Games. While Peeta vehemently disagrees with the notion, Katniss agrees thinking only of revenge. Way to have some growth, Katniss, it's really endearing of you. To me, Katniss is an empty shell of a person. She is hardly the only person in Panem to have suffered hardship, so she should probably grow up and deal with things as a functioning human would. But Katniss seems to have no soul and hardly any humanity at all--and this is the heroine leading us through this acclaimed trilogy.  It's true that the series is fast-paced, compelling, exciting. But if one takes a step back to examine, at least, the first two books, what is it? Nothing but a weak, bare-boned story about a girl surviving in some woods by killing others in devious ways. The story of the revolution is very thin indeed in comparison to the graphic details of kids killing each other in cold blood. In other words...boring, brutish, and barbarian, just Katniss displaying her lack of moral character as she clings to survival. Yawn. But more disturbing, these books offer no redemption, no message of hope. Just blackness. It's unsettling and disturbing...and even more disturbing that so many people are considering this series so wonderful.  Yes, I know--the books are deeply symbolic, meaningful, brilliant. But not to me. To me they are nothing but a waste of paper concerning one soulless, selfish, unlikable girl and a whole lot of death. This series will never be anything to me, and the current hype around it is ENTIRELY undeserved. As for me, I'll never waste a cent on any part of this franchise--books, movies, or anything else. Brilliant? Please. If you want to read a really brilliant story, try something with a little more redemption and humanity.
I'm not sure how I feel about The Hunger Games. At the end of the day, isn't it about whether or not you liked it and would recommend it to someone else? Yes? Then, okay, consider me as giving it a thumbs up. The book is entertaining--you want to know what kind of curveballs Katniss and Peeta are thrown next during the actual Games.  On the other hand, as I think about the story as a whole (or perhaps as a "hole")...it's shallow.  Let's start with the love story. I could see all along and was expecting Peeta's feelings for Katniss to spark some sort of emotional turmoil within the heroine...she started to love him only because it meant survival. I have no issues with that. My biggest problem with the love story was this hint of a love triangle developing with Gale. Gale was present for all of one or two chapters. I don't think his character was developed well enough to make Katniss' conflicting emotions at the book's end believable. Someone in her shoes would have either been in love with Peeta or not in love (or not think that they might be in love) with anyone else. At the beginning, we're not given any reason to believe that Katniss might have feelings for Gale, and the fact that she starts considering that possibility two-thirds of the way through the book, with Peeta (who she thinks is generous and handsome) obviously falling hard for her, feels unnatural. In the end, the way the love story was left as a sort of cliffhanger was expected but it still felt shallow beyond that.  Secondly, I'm not sure I'd classify this book as young adult...and the fact that they say 13 year olds can read it is laughable. I'm an adult male with fairly moderate views, especially when it comes to violence and sex...but when I think of how this book will be played out as a movie, I feel that there's no way it couldn't be rated R, if the movie stays true to the book. Children are impaled by arrows and spears, creatures bite off huge chunks of other kids' legs, and Katniss is completely naked (in front of an adult man) on more than one occasion. I know she's not in the buff in any sexual situations but it still seems off to me. I don't know.  That said, as a communication professor, I enjoyed the book's study of reality television and look forward to seeing the movie. Going forward, however, the issues present in this first book, mostly as it relates to Katniss' character and her underdeveloped internal conflict, makes me question whether or not I want to read "Catching Fire." That is my current internal conflict.
I read the entire book in one night.  Brutal in so many ways, yet without causing damage to the reader, and certainly no dwelling on pain, suffering, or violence just for the sake of it.  Compelling, cool story, solid character development, and well-constructed plot. Not the most original concept for a story, but certainly has enough angles, twists, and depth in and of itself to make for a very worthwhile read. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and enjoyed the pure escapism it offered.
I was not sure what to expect after seeing the teen/Sci-Fi label attached to this Novel. Being a middle aged male and seeing the main character was a teenage young adult female, I was wondering if I had made a mistake in ordering this.  I was quite pleasently surprised, with the magnetically riveting tale of a future that was dark, bleak and saddening. What has become of a once great continent. A story of a girl becoming a woman in the most brutal circumstance. When she's forced to chose between family,friendship,love and survival. A future where young people are forced to play a game of battle, and survival between what would be called states or districts to the death.  Only one can claim victory! Maybe not as simple as it seems. We all have choices in our lives, this young woman has to make choices in a world gone mad, where government has decided that these games must take place to keep an already beaten down people in there place. Well written, entertaining and a real page turner is how I would describe this work. I would have to say yes it has a teen flare as it's told from the young ladies perspective in her own narration. I enjoyed it all the same.  I would recommend this novel to anyone above the age of 10 or so, it does have some violent passages. Overall a nice surprise, glad I ordered it at the end of reading. I might even get the sequel. Which I would assume will be on it's way.  If it looks interesting to you, pick it up. You will enjoy it.
Read the books one after the other within a few weeks. Interesting theme, fast paced in certain parts but did not keep me engaged. Lost momentum in the second book but picked it up again in the last book which was good. Not a book I would typically select but was suggested  by my daughter who loved them and we enjoyed having discussions about the themes, characters etc.
Well this book is as different from Collins' Gregor the Overlander series as it could be.  While the Gregor books were simply good, The Hunger Games is outstanding.  There is constant action as Katniss is literally fighting for her life most of the book.  The first time I read this book, I thought it was a sort of spoof on Survivor.  It is kind of like Survivor, except it is a fight to the death.  I read this book through in one sitting, forgoing food and water to keep reading!  I was dismayed to find that it is part of a trilogy and have been anxiously awaiting subsequent books in the trilogy to find out how it ends.  For those looking for love or romance, there is very little of that in this book.  This is something men would like as much as women, due to the lack of emotions beyond those of fear, determination, and survival against all odds.  In fact, my husband loved this book and he is not a reader.  Things I like about The Hunger Games:  1. The plot: so many twists!  2. The pacing: once you start, you just can't stop!  3. The world building: finally, a fantasy novel that I "get" right away, without having to read hundreds of pages to figure it out (like I did with The Demon King).  4. The character development.  5. The suspense: You would think that having already read THG twice, I would not be as caught up in the suspense---but I was. My heart was pounding at certain parts, even though I already knew what would happen.  6. The page turning action: just try to NOT read this one in one day, or even one sitting!  7. The emotion: Is there anyone who read about Prim's shirt tail slipping out of her waistband as she walks up to the stage at the reaping and didn't want to cry? I know I did! Or what about Rue and the flowers? Even Peeta's leg at the end made me sad again.  Things I don't like about The Hunger Games:  1. The character names were a little difficult to adjust to.  2. The constant focus on finding and cooking food makes me want to eat!  If for some unearthly reason, you have not read this book, drop everything and go read it now!  I'm not a gusher by nature but I could go on and on about how great this series is!
Well this book lived up to a lot of the hype that surrounds it. While the name and cover still do not grab my attention the story, once started, did.  This book is written in first perspective, from the heroine's aspect. Her name is Katniss Everdeen. She starts off in her home, a simple, poor area of the land. She is the provider for her mother and sister with her hunting skills. To protect her younger sister, she is sent to the capitol, along with local boy Peeta, to 'participate' in the annual Hunger Games.  These 'games' are fights to the death, aired and shown to the capitol and all 12 districts under its control, in a survival arena of sorts. The book shows, throughout the story, a somewhat futuristic dystopia society. The tributes (Katniss, Peeta and others in the game) are given basic weapons (bows, spears, clubs) and the district where Katniss is from uses herbs and eats basic foods (squirrel, wild turkey, etc) but the capitol has voice command room service, automatic hair dryers, and a camera/screen set that tracks and shows the tributes (no matter where they go) to the viewers. It is an interesting combination.  There is a 'romantic' setting as well. Katniss and Peeta are to appear as a united team to the people. Peeta even admits to liking her during his interview. So a setting for 'star-crossed lovers' is created. However, Katniss has various feelings toward Peeta throughout the book and its very realistic and understandable, especially when there is possibly another guy back home.  Yet while there are time I can relate to her, at the same time several of her thoughts want to make my roll my eyes or drop my head onto a desk. While she is survival smart, she is not people smart. She can't socialize and cannot read people worth a darn. While it is annoying at times, it is also endearing and has created a unique character.  Overall, very good book. 4 1/2 stars is my official opinion, but I will give it 5 since I can't do halves. Its a constant pace of survival, and action with just the right touch of romantic possibilities.
The Hunger Games is a facinating read, even if the concept of a corrupt government abusing it's control over its citizens has been done in simliar ways before, this book is certainly the most detailed and memerable one of the lot.  Katniss is a warrior even if she refuses to acknowledge this fact in herself. She has qualities most of the other tributes lack, her compassion being the biggest difference there is.  The things the tributes have to endure and do are horriying in our world. None of can imagine the fear and heartache of having to pit our children against each other to the death for the amusement of a bunch sobbish rich people.  Personally I think Katniss teaming up with Rue was a good thing. And regardless of the reasoning behind it, it was very strategic on both their parts. Both girls can move quickly and silently, and both accompany each other nicely in terms of food.  The Careers' trap is simple ingenious really. what better way to eliminate the competition? They however didn't factor in how cunning Katniss is, too bad for them really.  Katniss' closeness to the little girl Rue really made me cry. In my opinion a child that young should no way have been forced to compete with kids much bigger than she was. I like and respect Katniss for how she not only friended the little girl but honored her as well.  The gesture in District 11, when they gave Katniss the loaf of fresh bread after what she'd done for Rue doesn't go unnoticed by Katniss, and certainly by the reader either. I assure you my heart broke a second time in that small gesture of gratitude from the struggling district.  I'm unsure how believable Peeta still being alive when Katniss finds him is. Then again, like the tributes, the reader loses track of the days as well. What seemed like two or three weeks of events could very well have only been a few days.  Katniss overcoming her fears and distaste for playing the role of healer is remarkable, though I don't understand how Peeta had received no gifts from the sponsors while Katniss did.  Peeta and Katniss play the role of lovers almost flawlessly, though how Katniss can still think that Peeta is playing a role is beyond me.  I was sad at Foxface's fate. That girl was truly as clever as a fox. I think the biggest shocker for me were the Muttations. That totally blew me away and broke my heart all at the same time!  The last few chapters of the book were totally new for me. I've seen the movie and these chapters were surprisingly absent from the film. I look forward to getting my hands on book two  I give this book 5 of 5
I know so many people who have read THE HUNGER GAMES and loved it, that when I picked it up I was kind of nervous about not loving it. It's more common that, if the general public loved it, I'll love it too, but I was still worried.  I was most surprised by how much "before the Hunger Games" there was: the reaping, the parade, the training, etc. I expected it to get to the Games pretty quickly. The before stuff was still good, it really gave us a good chance to see the Capitol as a whole and the role that they played in the story. It was also a great time to lay character foundations. I think that the whole first half of the book is evidence that THE HUNGER GAMES is not a stand-alone novel. There's just too much setting up for it to get far enough into the story that it'll be done at the end of 374 pages.  The fact that Collins did spend so much time in character and plot development really is a plus. It definitely gives the reader time to connect to the characters. Even though we don't see Gale for long, we know that he's the most loyal best friend there is. And through the things Katniss remembers about Prim and her mother, we can definitely see what kind of people they are. Other characters like Haymitch and Cinna all add their own elements to the story.  Katniss herself was a very strong female lead. Her main goal is to stay alive, and you can't have any flimsy girly-girl in an arena with 23 other tributes, fighting for her life. Katniss was the perfect heroine. Peeta was a great character, too. Although he seems half-useless in the Games, you can also tell he's a really great guy. What I loved about him was how he cared so deeply, and seemed like a genuine human being throughout the novel. No matter what the Capitol, or anyone else, threw at him I always felt like he was an honest, caring person.  Since the majority of the book was about Katniss fighting for her life, there really wasn't a chance to develop much romance. It's constantly in the undercurrent because of their strategy, but any real romantic connection between Katniss and Peeta seems improbable and far-fetched. But I understand that. Either way, I'd almost like to announce myself as Team Peeta, but I feel like we aren't far enough into the love story to make any definitive conclusions ;).  Overall, THE HUNGER GAMES is a whirlwind of a story that takes you on the incredible journey of a girl fighting to live. Although the pacing makes it evident that this novel is the first in a series, there is a lot that happens. It's definitely the perfect beginning to a series. I'm pretty excited to see how the story is going to continue.
The story begins just before the reaping. One male and one female - between the ages of 13 and 18 - are chosen at random to represent their district in the Hunger Games - a brutal fight to death between 24 tributes from the 12 districts, where there can only be one champion. Katniss and Peeta (who she refers to as the boy with the bread) are the tributes for District 12 and are shuttled off to the Capitol to be prepped for the arena. The Hunger Games began years ago when the districts (13 of them at the time) revolted against the Capitol. The Capitol implemented the games as a reminder of that revolt and as a way to control the remaining 12 districts. The teens are first paraded in costumes that represent their districts in an opening ceremony. They are trained and graded on their skill and then they are interviewed, all for the sake of gaining sponsorship (help) in the arena. The twisted and voyeuristic nature of the games is not without genius. The citizens of Panem watch their children prepare for their deaths, and they are helpless to change.  When I first picked up the Hunger Games, it took me a few chapters to get into the narrative. The story is told from Katniss's point of view, however, it is written in first person present, so getting into the rhythm of the story took longer for me than most other styles. Overtime I grew to appreciate this style, especially since as a reader; I was experiencing everything as Katniss was and learning only what she knew.  Susanne Collins did a wonderful job of describing the dreary and dismal District 12, the hopelessness of its residents and the conflicting feelings that Katniss experiences. After losing her father to a mine accident, Katniss practically raised her kid sister since her mother was useless after her husband's death. Katniss had to grow up quickly, fend for herself and take care of her family; this makes her a fearless heroine, single-minded with only thoughts for survival. This also makes Katniss a very emotionally underdeveloped character. She hasn't had time to mourn her loss, she had to keep going in order to keep her family alive and this comes out as she enters the games.  Even though there is a lot of violence in the story, there is still a lot of character growth. Minor characters are given rich back stories and major characters full and by the end of the story, familiar. The plot twists were not immediately expected, there were a lot of times that I found myself wondering what really will happen next and was rewarded with an answer that left me wide eyed and open mouthed. As the reader leaves the arena and view the victory party, there is a feeling of impending doom - President Snow is not happy with the outcome, what will he do to our characters next?  While the Hunger Games is written for an older teen audience, I all can enjoy this and there is something in it for everyone.
I actually saw the movie first. When I saw the advertising and the crazed fans I kind of pushed it aside and ignored it because I hate fads. They usually tend to be shallow, superficial, and completely obnoxious. This book is none of those.  After I saw the movie, I had to get the book. And I spent the last two days reading it. I forced myself to put it down in the middle to get some sleep, it was that hard to stop reading. I have to admit, it is partially that 90-95% of chapters end in cliffhangers. In most books that gets annoying, but here it's completely understandable. It's the stream of consciousness of a girl in a kill or be killed situation. But it's also the story. It's almost impossible to depart from this story without knowing what turns it's going to make. Actaully, I KNEW in advance what the turns would be and I still wanted to keep going. That, in a nutshell, is an authors dream. It's a bit of a mantra we're taught in writing classes: "People are looking for every excuse to put your book down. Don't let them." Indeed, Ms. Collins has perfected that art.  It was also a bit difficult to read, mostly because of the premise. I bawled, I'll admit. It's extremely painful to think about. But it's also a potential future for us, and please let me explain that. Our populations are growing, what will we do when we run out of food and space but kill each other off for our own survival, as happens in the history of this book? Then you know someone will set up a regime (if people are left at all) and quite possibly will do anything to make sure the rest of the people serve them, need to serve them. That's history, and it's so eerie because it feels so real.  My last comment is that I'm glad it was aimed at young adults. After other horrendous books (that shall not be named, though we all know which four I speak of, I'm sure), it's great that something is there to treat them like mature, intelligent adults. That is what young adult fiction should be, not the excuse it currently is for bad writing and even worse story telling. However, it will take a mature mind to be able to handle this. I believe the tween/teen/young adult range IS capable, if they put their minds to it, but the people I find not liking it are the kind that can't handle it. Or, like me, they haven't tried it because they assume it's just another pathetic fad.  People, don't be like me. If you have a level, mature head, read this book. Just make sure you have a good stretch of time to read it. And, if I may offer, the best place to put it down if you need to is in the MIDDLE of a chapter, not at the end. That harkens back to my earlier comment about cliff hangers. She isn't kind to people who need to finish their chapters before going to bed, so break that habit and cut it off in the middle of a chapter if you have to cut it off anywhere.
I read this because of all the hype surrounding it. I should know better! It was very disappointing because I was expecting something much better than this. It's not the worst book I've ever read, but it's not very good. It is also written in the first person, and I personally prefer third person omniscient narration. I dislike first person because it makes it impossible for the reader to know anything that is going on outside of the protagonist's view, and in the hands of a mediocre author, it makes for a very poor story.  To begin with, there were too many plot holes, and the characterization was very poor. When I finished this book, I honestly didn't even care what happened to any of the characters. They could all die, including the protagonist, and I wouldn't miss any of them. That's not really what you want to go for when writing a book. I felt the author has a poor sense of humanity and history. I find it absurd that people would allow their children to be taken from them without any sort of protest. There should have been permanent civil unrest. Death is no deterrent. There are things that are much worse than being killed, like having your twelve year old daughter taken from you.  I also felt the author is simply pandering to unthinking teenage girls by writing a sanitized novel that wouldn't offend anyone. There is no mention of religion or political ideology, so what exactly runs this continent wide dictatorship? If Hitler couldn't keep a dictatorship going for more than a few years in an area as small as Germany, what sort of person could run one over an entire continent for so long? No one is the correct answer.  I also felt the author had never hunted (or bothered to research hunting) and had never been to the area she had written about. It supposedly takes place in the Appalachian mountains near West Virginia or maybe western North Carolina/eastern Tennessee. I'm not sure she knows how important religion is to the people who live there. You would never be able to get it out of them, not in a million years.  Stupidity apparently does sell, and quite well. I find it ironic that the author wrote this book as a reaction to reality television, because I feel the book is written about as well as one of those shows. Most don't think very much about the media that is being fed to them. If someone says it is supposed to be good then they believe it is, whether that is true or not.  The overall premise was interesting, and perhaps some of the above wouldn't have bothered me so much if the author had actually written a good story with well developed characters (see: Willing Suspension of Disbelief). If you are wondering whether you should read it, I wouldn't bother.
Is it worth it to play it safe or risk it all? How does a person have trust in others? In The Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins, these questions are asked constantly throughout the novel. The novel revolves around sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen from District 12. Katniss volunteers to go in place of her sister, Prim, into the annual Hunger Games, an event where a boy and girl are chosen from twelve districts to compete to fight to the death. Only one can become the victor out of twenty-four teenagers. Tributes (the boys and girls chosen to battle) must use their special talents, skills, and techniques to overpower one another in a fight for survival. Collins wanted to elaborate on how governments can have complete control over a society; the futuristic representation of North America in The Hunger Games, Panem, is an excellent example of a dystopia.    Collins wrote The Hunger Games to show how a government can alter and abuse their power to their benefits. The Capitol created the Hunger Games in order to punish the twelve districts in Panem after the fall of District 13. People of Panem called that day the "Dark Days," where "Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated" (Collins 18). The Capitol wanted to demonstrate how powerful they were against the mass population. The society of Panem represents a dystopia. The government has complete control over society, but has gotten to the point where problems, such as poverty and famine, appear. The government also persuades the people that without their support, chaos would arise between districts; in actuality, the Capitol wants to contain and prevent rebellions from happening in the future. Collins is trying to send a message to the reader that problems in the book is a reflection of problems everyday; districts are constantly attacking another just like ethnicities, religions, and genders attack each other today.   The author's style of writing, especially in The Hunger Games affected her at an early age. Collin's father served in the Vietnam War as a lieutenant colonel when she was growing up. Her father taught her about military life, his experiences in the war, and even skills. Having been raised in a military family, she was influenced by the techniques that should be used in battle, especially in The Hunger Games.   The Hunger Games is similar to the Japanese novel Battle Royale, written by Koushun Takami. Panem, a representation of future North America, goes in hand with the setting in Battle Royale in that the setting takes place in future Japan. In The Hunger Games, Two tributes are taken from the twelve existing districts, choosing teenagers ranging from twelve to eighteen years old. This is similar to Battle Royale in that a group of teenage high school students are taken to an isolated island and are forced to fight to the death until one person remains. Lastly, both are similar in that the government has complete control over its people.   Suzanne Collins wrote the novel in the first person view of Katniss Everdeen. The reader is able to evaluate the thoughts and actions that Katniss presents. This is beneficial to the plot because the reader will be able to see why she makes certain decisions (her actions are significant as the plot progresses). For example, in the beginning of the novel, her sister Prim gets her name pulled out of the raffle to participate in the games. Katniss instead volunteers as tribute. As the reader examines the novel, one is able to discover why she takes such risks (entering her in a fight for survival); Katniss is protective over her sister ever since her father's death.   The author uses repetition in the novel, which were used in various ways to either grab the reader's attention or even trying to get a point across. One piece of information that was used constantly was "`And may the odds be ever in your favor!'" (Collins 19). This statement in the book basically means "good luck". In my opinion, it is a bit ironic; Effie Trinket, the announcer for District 12, constantly repeats this saying even though she knows that the chance of one person winning is slim. Twenty-three people will be killed in battle while one person receives all the glory. After reading this book, this quote stood out to me the most.   The novel of The Hunger Games fascinates readers all over the world. The book is an easy read, has an excellent plot, and entertains teens and adults. Although not recommended to a younger audience due to its dark and sometimes disturbing scenes, the author does a fine job by demonstrating an overpowered government controlling over their nation. Readers will also be able to pick up on how The Hunger Games can relate to similar novels about dystopias such as 1984. Suzanne Collins does a marvelous job by attracting readers to the novel, making it one of the most popular read books out there.
Collins introduces us into a dystopian world in which Panem, the predominant nation in North America, holds annual, brutal, bloodbaths called "Hunger Games" in order to suppress and subdue the citizenry. We see the world through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, a tough as nails teenage girl bent on taking care of her mom and little sister by whatever means necessary. Brazenly, Katniss takes the place of her younger sister when Primrose is chosen to be a contestant in the Hunger Games. Collins then adeptly builds suspense to the breaking point at which time hell is let loose in an arena in which children and teenagers fight to the death.  The Cons:  1) Collins spends a substantial length of her book describing what each contestant is or will be wearing in the Hunger Games procession. My wife enjoyed the focus on clothing and fashion. I could have done without knowing the details of what each contestant would be wearing.  2) The trilogy didn't end with this book. The next two novels aren't as thought out, developed, or unique.  3) We don't learn a lot about the other districts in Panem. If Collins had spent the time she did on everyone's wardrobes leading up to the Games on getting to know the terrain, culture, and people in the other districts I feel we would have had a much better idea of and appreciation for her world building.  The Pros:  1) Character development is solid and perfectly paced  2) The story is suspenseful, dramatic, and adequate...no big holes or let downs in the plot itself.  3) Though we see the world through the eyes of Katniss, she doesn't necessarily pick up on all the things we, as readers, are able to deduce. Collins did a great thing in writing the narrative from the perspective of a teenage girl, and to the author's credit, she realistically portrays that world view. Katniss doesn't know everything, particularly when it comes to reading people and their intentions. For example, she struggles with knowing the intentions of her male friends while the readers are able to see between the lines and deduce for themselves what Katniss misses because of personality defects.  In all "The Hunger Games," is a very well written novel that will sufficiently pull you into a post apocalyptic and chilling world that is a reminder to us all what could happen should freedom become second to the alluring safety and strength brought by dictatorship.
This action-packed thriller lacks the background and character development to give substance to its narrative.  The author devotes 75% of the book to the thrill of the hunt, the predator-prey relationships, the cold calculating strategies and dynamics of the kill, but only 10% to the cultural setting and background of a society so desperate and so degenerate as to obediently sacrifice its children to suffering, torture, and death in a nationally-televised gladiator super bowl.  The author devotes not more than 15% of the book to the interplay of human emotions, such as empathy, fear, anger, trauma, desperation, and self-sacrifice that one would expect to explore in greater depth for a better understanding of the culture.  Too many questions are left unanswered.  Why are the children so cooperative in the preparation for their slaughter?  Why are their parents so submissive?  Why, with few exceptions involving the main characters, are the children described as hardened soldiers devoid of conscience or emotion as they go about slaughtering each other?  Why is there no mention of rebellion within the districts, and why do the districts police themselves so harshly if they aren't occupied by standing armies from the federal capital?  The reader is left with an empty shell, a top-heavy narrative with the action and adventure of Steven Spielberg's "Jaws," but with the background and character development of "The Three Bears."  In literary comparison this book is dwarfed by the rich prose of Margaret Mitchell's epic "Gone With the Wind," that takes the reader deep into southern culture; and by the strong cultural setting and impassioned emotional development of the television miniseries "Roots" based on Alex Haley's novel about a family's struggle under the tyranny of slavery in the old South; and by the gripping triumph of the human spirit so vividly expressed in the American drama film "Stand and Deliver," based on the true story of high school math teacher Jaime Escalante who overcame all odds to teach calculus to reluctant students in an environmentally unfriendly high school district of East Los Angeles.  The ancient Greek aphorism "Know thyself" applies more to the reader than to the author or the narrative.  So what in this story appeals most to you?  You can think about it.
This seems like a good time to review The Hunger Games, what with the movie destroying the box office and all. This is a dystopian science fiction story about an annual competition in which children fight to the death. They are forced to participate in this as a penance for a civil war that occurred many years earlier. The main character is one plucky teen (Katniss) who volunteers for the ordeal so that her younger sister doesn't have to participate. There is a also a romantic subplot with a slight amount of intrigue in that she has two boys that admire her. I'm sure you can guess what happens to her in the end (hint: there are two sequels).  In terms of plot, although it doesn't really have anything groundbreaking (the plot borrows heavily from The Long Walk and Battle Royale), but it's well paced and exciting to read through. I couldn't put it down and stayed up fairly late finishing it. However, it doesn't offer much apart from that. The setting and premise is completely illogical (for enjoyment it's best not to think too much about it): why would the ruling government think that slaughtering children is a good way to maintain peace? It's also implied that the ruling government maintains its wealth and happiness at the expense of the poorer outlying districts, but as described the districts have vastly less population, and given its advanced economy it seems unlikely that the government would really need the labor regardless. The best that can be said about the writing is that it's workmanlike--it doesn't get in the way, but you won't really every get much joy from some particular diction or turn of phrase. It's also unfortunate that the novel focuses so much on the violence of the hunger games themselves, rather than on the characters' feelings about it. Only Katniss shows any kind of nontrivial thought, and yet the potentially interesting love triangle among her and her suitors is barely explored.  Overall, if come in not expecting much more than cheap thrills, you won't be disappointed. After I finished I felt sort of hungover, like I had just consumed some drug that, while giving me an enjoyable high, left me empty inside of any authentic stimulation. But I don't want to understate how fun the book is to read while you are doing it. After all, it's not possible to read intelligent literature all the time, and if you read The Hunger Games instead of watching reality TV, then that's at least some improvement.
I've been meaning to read this book for quite a long time now. The recent release of the movie trailers have convinced me to go ahead and do it already.  I was instantly bored, and the only thing that kept me reading was the reassurance from friends that it would get better further in. There was far too much telling and not enough showing. Which isn't really the author's fault at all. Stories that are that action-packed are incredibly difficult to portray in words.  I have a feeling the movie will do better than the book, but I have to give mad props to the author for coming up with such a great story.  I thought the romance was played up too much. I'm big on cheesy romance, but they kissed every other word. It was kinda getting on my nerves. I knew Katniss wasn't really into him, but Peeta was killing me. I actually got pretty into the book by the end of it and was loving how much he loved her.  Once I forced myself past the first couple pages, I actually read the entire thing in one sitting. I thought the author played the emotions of the reader (myself) very well. I was hating the capitol and feeling sorry for the tributes. It was a pretty emotional book. I felt that with more showing and less telling, I would have probably cried at least once. Maybe even multiple times.  All in all, I skimmed a lot during the first part. Once it got to the actual hunger games, I was enjoying it much more.  This is one of those books that I don't have much to say about. It's a book that speaks for itself. It's not one of my favorites, and I'll probably never read it again, but I'm definitely glad I read it. It's given me a lot to think about and is making me quite excited for the movie.  I only hope they do the story justice.
As a first note, beyond a few sparse comments I am not going to give the plot of The Hunger Games away at all. If you want to know more about it just pick it up and read it for yourself. Or wait and go see the movie, although I always advocate reading the books in a series before seeing the movie. Let's face it, film just never will have the capacity to capture all of the things that go on in a beloved character's head the way the printed page does. But I digress, so back to the review.  I've seen numerous comparisons between Suzanne Collins The Hunger Games and Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. Even I made the mistake of assuming she'd likely  taken a similar premise. However when I picked up The Hunger Games and started reading it I realized there is little resemblance between the two books outside of fact that both are about teenagers forced into a fight to the death by a totalitarian government bent on reminding its citizens that they can and will do anything to anyone who rebels. If anything this book actually reminded me more of the Stephen King novel The Long Walk, which pitted teenage boys in a death march to the finish with the last boy standing declared the winner.  But all three books essentially have little to do with each other beyond likely being inspired by real life events throughout history that we've seen repeated time and again. The brutal Roman gladiator games and the child soldiers of Sierra Leone are just two real life examples that come to mind, let alone the fact that public be-headings and hangings used to be considered fit entertainment for the whole family in this world's not distant enough past. Having read all three books mentioned here in this review I think it's safe to say no one got the idea for their books from anyone else. Just that three different writers came up with three very different and excellent ways to use the past and their vivid imaginations to give us a window into common themes everyone can identify with: why bending to a totalitarian government is always a bad idea, preserving one's humanity in the moment when it seems least likely one can do that, loyalty, love, friendship, family and of course, how the human spirit can refuse to be broken even in the worst of times.  The Hunger Games delivers on all of these themes and more in spades. I was captivated by its heroine Katniss Everdeen from the first page and Suzanne Collins does a wonderful job of making you care not only for Katniss and her fate, but the lives of everyone that she touches. So of course I am adding Suzanne Collins and her trilogy to my list of authors and books that not only give me entertainment on those chilly nights when insomnia strikes, but leave me to ponder the larger themes of life in general. And maybe once I'm done with her trilogy I'll go make a return trip to those other two books I mentioned in my review as well. Each one stands alone on its own merit although I like the fact that I get to follow Katniss further into her journey from the girl in the woods to leader of a very much needed rebellion.
I really do not understand the people who think that this book does not have substance or is too shallow and action-oriented. Katniss is a complex character who represents the moral conflict involved in such a complex situation. I dont know if people are expecting her to be some kind of great hero who somehow wins the games and saves the lives of every contestant, but that is impossible here and she, like every other contestant(except one, wont spoil it here), puts her survival before all else. Still, she is conflicted by feelings of friendship toward other contestants and this internal conflict is revisited throughout the story. She is confronted with the choice of faking romantic feelings for another contestant in exchange for gifts that will help her survive. Is this really such an amoral thing to do when you put it in perspective? The kicker is that those feelings begin feeling real, and she simultaneously wants to pursue them and avoid them, weighing the costs to both herself and others. The morals involved in this story are complex and undefined. Those looking for black and white, right and wrong, good vs. evil will not find it here (exception being the obviously evil capitol). Ironically, they are the ones calling this story and its character shallow when really the characterization of Katniss is about as realistic as such an unrealistic scenario could provide. Which brings me to my next point: realism. This is a science-fiction novel, and i have come across reviews complaining about it being unrealistic. One person said the author knows nothing about medicine. Guess what? We dont know anything about what kind of medicine may exist at any time in the future that this story is taking place. Obviously, they have medicine that can do things that no medicine can do now. Its fiction, shes allowed to make stuff up. All in all, this is a very good book with exceptional pacing and a great balance of action, detail and substance that will leave you unable to put it down. I look forward to the rest of the trilogy
Heck, I'm one for a strong female protagonist, but this book does just about everything they could to make Katniss look like the ultimate hero. Let's try to write a review without spoiling anything.  The book is a fun and quick read, something you might think of as a palate cleanser.  At a little over 370 pages with extremely generous spacing and font size, the book can be read fairly quickly.  There's nothing wrong with this, sometimes that can be very refreshing after a more intense larger book (hence the pallet cleanser comment).  Let me say right now that I liked the book enough to pick up the sequel.  It has many problems, but it does just enough right to make me curious of what happens next.  The concept is cool, though some might find it unoriginal.  I won't go into the Battle Royale similarities, since I am sure many others have already done this.  The political setting is very intriguing.  The bravery of the main characters really shines as well.  Let's delve into the negatives of this story.  Nearly everything in this book seems a little convenient.  There are certain twists and turns that prevent the main character from having to make any real major decisions.  The other characters fall into two major groups as I titled the review.  Psychos who are so blood thirsty they can't think, or inepts who either don't have survival skills or can't fight (not both really).  It takes away from a lot of the danger Katniss faces each day of the games.  Also the frequency of romance would be vomit inducing if it was actually put on the screen, and have the exact opposite effect that it is supposed to have on the audience.  There are a lot of improvements to be made in Suzanne Collins' storytelling.  With that said, I can see some major potential in this series and will at least read the next book.
I've been hearing about The Hunger Games for a few years now. Fellow friends and readers have urged me on several occasions to pick up the book, the whole trilogy in fact. Two things put me off the idea. The first was the fact the the novels are considered "Young Adult."  As a fairly well-read individual of many genres, with plenty of classic and modern literature under my belt - I had trouble visualizing myself reading a book written for children.  Secondly, when friends tried to describe the plot to me, it just didn't make a whole lot of sense.  After reading it, I see why. The plot is difficult to describe to those uninitiated to the captivating world of Panem. When I heard they were adapting the novels to film I thought, "Fine! Let's see what all this commotion is about!"  It was a great decision. For those of you with doubts similar to those I harbored, allow me to put your mind at ease.  The Hunger Games, and the entire trilogy are really NOT young adult novels.  The only reason I can find for this classification (and I've given this much thought) is that the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen - is sixteen years old when the series begins.  The story is written from her point of view, but with the highest level of style and imagery.  There is nothing juvenile or simplified about the plot, or the writing.  In fact, the diction is every bit as solid as that of Stephen King or any number of bestselling authors whose novels rest comfortably a few rows away from the YA section. The tone of the novel is grim and candid, no punches are pulled as Collins expertly describes a brutal, violent and dark dystopian future.  If the concept of a "dystopian future" wrinkles your brow - worry not.  No one wants to read another knock off of 1984, and there are dozens.  Beneath veneer of a world gone wrong lies an emotional torrent of hope and bravery that breaks through to the reader in every page.  However, the world of Panem is a violent place, and the plot - which very simply put - consists of children between the ages of 12 and 18 being placed into vast arenas and forced to murder one another with any available means.  Again, this is not a book for children.  But of course, the story goes much farther than that - and the trilogy as a whole has a thoughtful and original plot that leads the reader into deeper places than the lip-biting thrills of the games themselves.  Many reviews have been written with greater detail in regards to the plot, and I don't want to spoil even the smallest twists for the would-be reader.  The point is this; if you feel disinclined to read a YA novel, throw your inhibitions away and go for it, you will not be disappointed by the adult quality of writing and the very adult content of the plot.
I am a fan of young adult literature, but it is very rare that a book written for young adults is just as intriguing and moving to adults themselves. I could not put this book down and I read it in its entirety in only two days. The Hunger Games touches on issues that are relevant today, and issues that are similar to those found great literature like George Orwell's 1984. Suzanne Collins has created a world where politics are extremely corrupt, fighting to the death is an annual sport as admired and loved by some as the Olympics, and life itself is something you have to survive.  Katniss Everdeen is a strong sixteen year old girl who is determined to save her family. She is stronger and braver than most adults in the story, but at the same time she is extremely relatable to an adolescent reader. Her concerns range from that of love, family, and commitment to friends, but she also has to worry about putting food on the table in order for her family to live. She is a very believable character that any reader would love.  The story line is violent, but not to the point where it would necessarily disturb its readers. One could compare The Hunger Games to the games of the Roman gladiators, with a little bit of Survivor mixed in. There is a lot of psychology found in the story and I myself have used it in a unit and applied advertising and persuasion to the story line. Teachers, you should try to work this into your curriculum because it is relateable, promotes critical thinking, and lends itself nicely to critical analysis and discussion. Your students will definitely be immersed in this novel! Manipulation, death, survival, and a small romance plot make this novel a must read for adolescents and adults alike. You will laugh, you might cry, but you will definitely want to read the two novels that follow!
OK! I get it! I finally get what all the hype is about! Why did it take me so long to read The Hunger Games? Something all readers have experienced: Too many books, too little time! But I finally started this book, and I couldn't put it down! I've never read anything like it, that's for sure. I'm sure I don't have to describe the plot, because I'll bet everybody has heard of it in one form or another. There's the book and the movie being made, so that info is readily available. I will just talk about what a wonderful writer Suzanne Collins is and how much I loved this book!  I envy writers. I envy them their ability to take an idea, something totally out of the blue, and create a whole new world out of that one idea. People and places that you feel you know when they are described to you. That is a true gift, and one that Suzanne Collins has in spades! The world she created in The Hunger Games is desolate and terrible, with starvation and death an everyday occurrence. Yet, because she is so gifted, she also creates moments of sweetness, affection, and hope in the direst of circumstances. She makes you truly care about the characters and what they are going through, and she makes you want to keep reading even when the subject matter is horrendous. You want to take that little spark of hope and watch it grow into something greater than the whole. You feel everything that Katniss and Peeta feel. Their situation is impossible, but they do the best they can with what they have.  If this book were all about how awful the world is that the characters live in, then it wouldn't be worth reading. It's the hope that it could possibly get better that makes this book a keeper.  In summary, in case you can't tell, I loved this book! I highly recommend it to all YA and dystopian lovers alike :)
I have decided my reviews are going to be more about my opinion of the book than a synopsis of the storyline itself. If you need a general overview of the storyline there are countless other reviews you can read that will tell you all you need to know, and more.  So many reviews give so much away.  These kinds of reviews spoil my reading experience. When I read a review what I am looking for is an assessment and how the book affected the reader. Basically, I am trying to make my review what I look for in a review.  Initially, I was going to give The Hunger Games three stars, not because I did not enjoy it, but because when I first began reading I found the writing style to be a little simplistic.  A deep story, but a shallow way of telling it.  I have read books written for a younger audience before that I have completely enjoyed as an adult, and have found the writing to be perfectly mature. I don't think teen books need to be, or even should be, simplistic in style. The first chapter or two did not immediately grab me, the premise of the story, yes, but not the writing. I decided, however, as the book progressed, that the writing did also.  One example is When Peeta told Haymitch that Katniss did not understand the effect she could have on people and Katniss was offended, she thought she was being insulted.  My reaction was "oh come on" that is such an obvious and easy route to take, but in reality most teen girls are going to at least wonder if there might be a compliment in there, somewhere, I think.  Later in the day Katniss did indeed wonder just that.  This started happening more and more, my initial and immediate frustration with a certain situation would dissipate after I continued reading. The characters and situations become less one dimensional.  I found The Hunger Games to be like better reality television, even though the subject matter is extremely intense and thought provoking to my mind it is also at least somewhat of a fluffy read.  That may sound odd, to call a book set in such a torturous, difficult and unjust world fluffy, but it does lack just a little seriousness. I don't read much fantasy fiction at all, and to be honest it is not my thing, so I concede that I might be judging this aspect of the book a little harshly, and not giving the fantasy aspects of the storyline credibility they may well deserve.  It is possible I would consider the book to be more serious if there were no people in the future dyed green or sprayed sparkly. The purple and plucked people are not keeping me away from the sequel though, that is for sure! Like better reality tv I found the story undeniably entertaining. It seems I have become hooked on this barbaric fluff! My first thought after I finished reading last night was that I absolutely must know what happens next! I am giving the book four stars, because as my review title suggests I am going to the store to purchase the second book in the series TODAY. I don't think I will ever consider the Hunger Games to be a great book, but it absolutely is addictive and the characters became compelling!
America has fallen and in its wake stands the oppressive country of Panam. 12 districts are inslaved to the mighty capital. The people of the districts work until exhaustion. Then there is the Hunger Games. Once a year, a boy and girl from each district are chosen to fight to the death in a dangerous arena.  Katniss is a sixteen year old girl who has grown up to quickly. When her father dies in a mining accident, her mother drops into a deep depression. The survival of the family then falls on Katniss's shoulders, who is at the time only 12. Though she is strong and learns to hunt. Miraculously, she saves her mother and sister from starving to death, but soon she sees that its not enough. When the people gather for the annual hunger games four years later, it's Katniss's little sister Prim who is chosen to fight. In one last effort to save Prim's life, Katniss volunteers to go in her place.    After years of hunting, Katniss knows how to kill, but can she take another human life as easily as she does an animal's? In the games, is there really a difference?    The Hunger Games will have you on the edge of your seat. I was sure as I was reading that a rebellion would break out. That something would save Katniss from participating in the games, but nothing does. You will not be able to put it down. Its a masterpiece that will make you think. At least, The Hunger Games made me wonder where exactly is our society headed. What our choices today will bring for our future. Also, it reminded me of how blessed I am. I know that after reading this book, I won't be taking anything for granted.    Read The Hunger games. It's amazing, addicting, and eye opening for those of us who have forgotten how well we live in modern society today.
One of those crazily persistent Amazon suggestions kept showing this book after I bought my Kindle 3 and I finally gave in. The next morning, bleary eyed from lack of sleep and with a full understanding that I wasn't going to get much done on my Christmas vacation, I bought the other 2 books in the trilogy. I can't say that I read them so much as I absorbed them into myself. So, even though there are over 1200 reviews here to read, I simply have to add my own.  Our story revolves primarily around a teen girl named Katniss, but includes many secondary characters of great vividness and depth including two teen boys, Peeta and Gale. These youngsters are from District 12 in the country of Panem; a future version of a collapsed United States. Being the final District in 12 total, her district mines coal as it's primary duty and life is exceptionally hard and brutal there. Unlike more advanced districts that make luxury goods or electronics, there is not enough food to really thrive and Katniss has been providing for her diminished family through poaching the forbidden forrests for years.  Panem, probably a shorter version of PanAmerica, experienced an uprising in the districts some generations back. As a result, District 13 was destroyed and made inhabitable and each of the remaining districts placed under terms of brutal submission. A reminder of this submission are the Hunger Games. These twisted annual games require that each district select 2 children, a boy and a girl, by lottery who are "tributes". In the games, they fight to the death in a specially erected environment.  This short description doesn't even broach the surface of it, really. Like today's Survivor or Ancient Rome's Gladiatorial games, there is intense competition in the Capital to have a more elaborate environment or compete for the best costumes at the opening ceremonies. All of this trite competition completely overlooks the basic hard fact that these children are going to be forced over days and weeks to kill each other. The more gruesome and horrible, the better they love it. And the environments themselves are dangerous, with many dying slowly of thirst or hunger or eaten by animals. The Gamemakers throw targeted horrors at them to keep things interesting and moving along on top of all that.  Katniss, as you might imagine, winds up in the games by volunteering for her younger and more gentle sister. It is she and Peeta, a boy who once saved her life and the life of her family with a single act of compassion, that now compete in the games in which only one of them can hope to survive.  While the games are certainly a focus of the book, the story artfully blends the life of District 12, the whirlwind leading up to the games and the game itself into a comprehensive whole. The masterminding of a strategy with an old drunkard winner, Katniss and Peeta leads to the romantic struggle as well. You become at once a member of the audience and the invisible rider on Katniss' shoulder, urging her on and forward throughout the book.  I genuinely enjoyed the story, which is taut and entirely original and can't imagine how this is geared towards teens other than the use of words below a certain grade level. In truth, the use of words works with this story in a way that using complicated words seen in "adult reading" books would not. Katniss would not resonate with the reader nearly as well.  There are two further books in the trilogy and both of those are equally highly recommended. I only suggest that you buy them all at once or be sure your Kindle is ready to receive before you start this one. You won't want to stop at the last page.
Oh my racing heart!  I now know why everything I've read about this book raves about it and tells you to make sure you have a period of time to devour this book start to finish.  I really don't know how I have managed to put it down the last couple of days!  The book is set in North America after a huge war which leaves the Capitol the victor and the districts the losers.  In the Capitol everything is peachy, but in the 12 districts, things are anything but.  Katniss is lucky that she and her friend Gale are able to hunt outside of the district lines without getting into too much trouble, since she provides meat for her family and other important families in her district.  The title of the book, The Hunger Games, comes from an event that is held every year.  Each child in a district, ages 12 - 18 has their name entered into a drawing that occurs before the games to select the male and female representative of their district.  Some, like Katniss, have their names in there multiple times, because once a month they can add their name to the drawing in order to get needed supplies for their families.  When her little sister, Prim, is chosen at her very first time of eligibility, Katniss immediately offers to take her place because she knows she has a much better chance of surviving than her sister.  The male chosen in this year's game is Peeta, the baker's son (and yes, this is important on more than one occasion.)  Once the kids are selected, they are taken to the Capitol to be prepared for the fight for their lives, literally.  The point of the games is to have one winner, the one who survives the longest.  I will say that there is killing in this book, some of it is brutal, but when it comes to survival, these young children have to make an extremely stressful decision: to kill or to be killed.  This book is a fast-paced riveting page-turner that will keep you guessing about the final outcome up until the last - so much so that I dreamed about the book last night (before I finished it)!  I can pretty much guarantee you that you will want more, but will find out that this is book one and I can tell you that book 2 isn't coming out until September 1st.  I, for one, can NOT wait!  (And if you're like me and tend to get impatient while waiting for sequel books to come out, read this one in August so you have less time to wait!)  The ending is good and solid, yet there is still a lot of information that we just don't get in the first book.  I am seriously chomping at the bit here, people!  Notes on the Cover:  I love the black.  It really hits home the point of the bleakness of the lives of the majority of the people in each district, also of the situation the Capitol forces on the people of the districts.  The gold mockingjay pin on the cover is beautiful.  I just know there is more to the story of this pin, but I just haven't totally figured it out yet, nor have I figured out why the person who gave it up did, and what their motivation was.  (In this book, it's all about the hidden objectives!)
The Hunger Games is a great book. Katniss Everdeen lives in the country of Panem which sits on the ruins of North America. Panem used to be capital surrounded by 13 districts. The districts rebelled against the capital but the capital defeated all the districts and destroyed district 13. As a reminder that the districts could not destroy the capital they invented the hunger games. In the hunger games  24 people are put into an arena and fight until there is only 1 left. The only rule is that you can't eat your enemies. Each year they had something called the reaping. That is when they pick who will be in that year's hunger games. You had to be between the ages of 12 and 18 to be chosen for the games. They put the name of everyone in that district in a drawing and pull one male and one female. Each year they add your name one more time. It is not fair because you can add your name more than once and they will give your family more grain. The poor people have to do this but the rich do not because they have plenty of grain .Katniss has her name in 20 times. Gale, Katniss's friend, has 42 slips. It is done one district at a time.  In the book, Prim, (short for Primrose) Katniss's younger sister's, name is picked.  Katniss volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the hunger games. The male selected for the hunger games was named Peeta.  Along time ago Peeta saved Katniss's life when she was starving by giving her some bread.  Many times there are people called Careers, who have trained to be in the hunger games their whole lives. But, Katniss has an advantage because she has hunted and knows what she can and can't eat.  The book has 6 main characters. They are Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, their mentor, Gale, Katniss's friend from back home, and Cinna. Katniss and Peeta were players in the games. Haymitch is a middle age man who is always drunk.  He plays the part of their mentor for the games. Gale is a hunting partner and friend of Katniss. Cinna is one of my favorite people. He is Katniss's stylist and is always helping her.  This book is geared toward young adults, but I would recommend this book for anyone over 12 years old. There is a lot of violence in it. The first half I found a little boring. It did not seem like much was happening. Then they got to the games and the fighting started. From there on I did not want to stop reading. This is not the first time this idea was used in a book. It is the same idea as "Battle Royale." This is a book about survival. Each person in the game needs to have survival skills, be able to outsmart the competition, and be strong and fast in physical ability. I thought that Suzanne Collins plot and ending were brilliant. Overall I think The Hunger Games is a great book that I really enjoyed reading.
The Hunger Games   If you like action blood and violence and your hungry all the time go to check out The Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games was written by Suzanne Collins I think she is a great author.  This awesome book has three hundred seventy four pages.  The Hunger Games has to sequels.  This book is about a girl named Catniss in a really poor district.  The districts are part of the Nation the Nation is made up of twelve different districts.  The districts poorer as they go up the capital is the riches of all.  Katniss is in the poorest district so she has to poach.  Every year the capital comes to collect two people from every district.  They start at district twelve.  The first tribute is a boy  Peeta Mallark.  The names go from side to side and make a swishing sound the girl tribute is.............  If you want to find out Read the Hunger Games.  Personaly my favorite part of The Hunger Games was when Katniss came back for Peeta.  I liked it because Peeta is awesome and he would have died if she hadn't come back for him.  He had a cut in his leg and almost bled to death.  The person Katniss killed had a first aid kit in his backpack and that is what saved Peeta.  Then they both lived in a cave for five days.  The most important thing I learned from this book was to make friends and keep them for a long time no matter what.  Never distrust them.  There are two sequels to The Hunger Games they are called Cathing Fire and Mocking Jay.  If you don't read The Hunger Games Catching Fire and Mocking Jay will not make since.   I recommend this book to all that seek adventure, action and survival.  Also if you like sudden changes this is the book for you! The Hunger Games.
This series is fascinating and brutal. It's addictive and you keep thinking about it long beyond finishing the books. I hesitated for a while to read them because of the many negative reviews, the comparison to Twilight (yawn) and supposedly bad ending but none of it is true. This is a great Trilogy and I wish there were more books. The target age group might be teenagers but I'm 46 and couldn't put them down. I'm glad I read them and can't wait for the movie.
This review is not just about HG, but the trilogy as a whole, which presumably most will finish.  To put this in perspective, I'm a 40 year old male who generally enjoys Michael Connelly and Harlan Coben.  I read the trilolgy due to all the hype and at the recommendation of others.  When I was on vacation recently, about 7 people were reading it by the pool, and not one person was under 45!  It's about a dystopian, futuristic North America, now called Panem, divided into 12 districts and run by the opressive Capitol.  Each year, a boy and girl from each district must fight to the death in an arena in a competition known as the Hunger Games.  It also deals with the struggle between the people and the government.  It's a mix of Lord of the Flies, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Mad Max, and The Running Man.  The Good:  1. A great, fun adventure/sci fi story.  It's worth reading for this alone.  2. Good character development.  3. The first-person-present-tense delivery is an effective literary device that works well for this story.  The Bad (which are really "nitpicks" for adult readers):  1. It's somewhat of a Harry Potter rip off with terms like Quarter Quell and characters named Plutarch Heavesnbee.  2. Prose/syntax: Ms. Collins overuses fragmented sentences (perhaps to add to the whole dark, dystopian setting) throughout the trilogy, which makes the prose very choppy at times.  Overall, this is a great series and I think many of the negative reviewers are over-analyzing.  Just kick back and enjoy it.
OK, I think this review would attract some violent attacks and rebuttals.  Just let me express my views and reasons before the fans would like to lay fists on me.  I admit that the story has nice designs and plots, and one can be addicted to it once he starts to read it. There IS a nice flow. BUT, after finishing the book in two days, I felt that the characters are but superficially developed. There is not much ink spilt on any prominent characters but their actions and words, so after finishing a large portion of the book I could not help thinking :"what have I read so far? so?" I can't really recall any feeling deeper than wanting to know how the characters would eventually come to their fates, which, inevitably, can be guessed right at the start.  When I have finished reading, my worry on superficiality was even further justified. When it ends, it ends, I could not really do thinks I usually do after reading a book such as sit back in my chair and ponder upon the story, characters, their fats, the ends, etc. There is nothing to be thought of, it is a simply story with a simple set up! I think that this is the main reason that I have such a feeling, and also the main reason some people fall in love with it too!  Anyway, I think I will wait some time before thinking of starting on the second book, and I am not saying that this book is bad, it is just maybe not my kind of taste. For someone who just wants a good read with intensity and twists, this would come handy. Hence, I gave the book a three star comment, it is neutral.
I posted a review of this book on my message board,  [...]  This is what I said-  Wow! Just wow!  I saw a sneak of the movie last year and thought it would be an interesting movie to check out. Then this past week I was reminded of it from a preview on a Blu-Ray I rented. So I paused the movie, went to Amazon and grabbed the book........and a new obsession is born.  This is probably the best book I've read in quite a while. And I don't say that lightly, because I've read some fantastic stuff this year including some of the work from some of our fellow Cryptsers.  I won't type out an entire synopsis, but what we have here in The Hunger Games is a post apocalyptic tale of the survival of the fittest story, of both body and mind, but it's also a love story. The combination of which tells me Suzanne Collins is a genius in capturing two genres that normally ignore each other and forcing them to realize how they can work together--meaning horrific dark fiction vs. romance. Don't misinterpret what I just said, there is no bodice ripping here, but it will tug on your heart strings.  And to think, this was published by Scholastic Press! What? Seriously? I haven't read one of their books since I was a kid plenty long ago. I guess I should pay more attention to what they're doing now, eh?  And for my added pleasure, I found out just today that this is a trilogy. I'm hitting Amazon as soon as I finish typing this to get BOOK TWO! :-)  Loved it, loved it, loved it. :-) Can't wait for the movie (or movies?)!!!!!  ~C
What I really like about this book is how the author states everything in a matter-of-fact way. There are no long passages aimed at describing every square inch of a scene, there are no characters droning on and on about their motives except the lead character of course. In effect, there is no pretentious 'world-building', no trace of a pseudo-dark atmosphere that seems to have permeated into every form of fictional medium these days. Don't get me wrong, this is a serious book and far from light-hearted, but there are no delusions of grandeur on the author's part trying to conceal a weak plot.  The author stays on top of the plot throughout the book and once I got through the first page, I couldn't stop. It compelled me to finish the trilogy in a matter of days and Katniss and Peeta are wonderfully fleshed out (in this particular book).  It isn't perfect though. The part of the book leading upto the finale is fairly slow (but the middle is amazingly intense), the Capitol and its population are not very well detailed in the sense that it is hard not to just cast them as debauched freaks and lastly, Katniss gets to escape from quite a few crucial decisions during the Games themselves although this seems to be counter-balanced by decisions she takes towards the end of the book.  It definitely is worth reading and take my advice and start reading this on a Friday evening. Or else have an excuse ready for your boss or your professor or your teacher for the next day ;)
Suzanne Collins has pulled of an amazing feat with "The Hunger Games," providing a heart-racing story that pulses with characters and a sense of old-time survival, while running parallel with near-future themes about society and entertainment. The premise--twenty-four contestants, ages 12-18, fighting each other to the end on national TV--sounds modern, but it hearkens to gladiator days, issues of genocide and oppression.  Katniss Everdeen is the young woman caught up in a struggle for her life after deciding to take her younger sister's place in the games. Viewed as a hero for this, she becomes an audience favorite, despite coming from a traditionally weak district. But Katniss is not weak. She's a survivor. She's helped provide for her family. And, underneath it all, a core of rebellion has been growing against the totalitarian government of the Capitol (set in the Colorado Rockies). Further endearing her to the fans and further complicating her own decisions, a boy from her same district confesses that he is in love with her, just before the brutal games begin.  Is Peeta lying to create sympathy for himself? Is he truly in love with Katniss? And if only one person can survive to win, who will it be? What about Katniss' family back home watching, and the boy she's grown close to during her hunting days in the woods of her past?  Collins does an incredible job of world-building, showing us a place that feels familiar and believable, yet odd and unsettling. The games themselves have the feel of long history. The character-building is equally adept, with Katniss seeming heroic and vulnerable, strong yet feminine. This world and these characters come together in a plot that is startling, satisfying, and fast-paced.  I've read some great books for this market--everything from Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter, the Tripod Trilogy, and the recent "The Purloined Boy"--and this ranks up there with such classics. With the perfectly titled "Catching Fire" on its way, I look forward to even more from this series.
I absolutely loved this book. I think it was amazingly written.  SPOILERS  This book is about a dystopian future where the US is split into 13 districts, rather than states. Every year each district must "sacrifice" a boy and a girl to go fight to the death in the Hunger Games.  Katniss is a 15 year old girl living in District 12. She is the main provider for her family, since her father's death years ago. On the day that the sacrifices are to be choosen, Katniss's little sister is choosen. Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place. A boy is choosen also, Peeta. Over the course of a week or so, Katniss and Peeta are sent to the Capitol to train, prepare, and get "polished". Once in the Arena for the Games, Katniss and Peeta split up, until almost the end when the rules are changed. Peeta and Katniss become a team in order to win the Games. Peeta and Katniss pretend to be in love in order to gain more supporters. Once Peeta and Katniss are the final two "survivors", the Games's officials tell them that they must fight to the death and that only one person can be the winner, which is reversing the rule change made halfway thru the game. After a daring move made by Katniss, the Officials are forced to allow both Peeta and Katniss to be named winners of the Hunger Games.  You are left wondering what will happen next to Peeta and Katniss. Will their faux romance become real for Katniss as it is for Peeta? Will there be reprecussions for Katniss's action?
My school assigned this book as summer reading for all (about to be) high school sophomores.  We are actually assigned to write a "letter" to Suzanne Collins and explain our thoughts about the ending or an important event in the book that causes us concern.  Though this is a great book, it has terrible, choppy, grammatically incorrect, and simply treacherous sentences scattered among the pages.  It seams as though there are a lot of run-on and fragment sentences, and the sentences don't really flow.  It seams as if the sentences are sometimes disorderly scattered in the paragraphs.  I find Suzanne to repeat a lot of the words she uses to describe actions and feelings often.  I'm not sure if this is due to a lack of vocabulary, or a lack of creativity or a thesaurus.  I must say though, that just because the grammar and sentence flow may be horrendous, it is a good book.  You're probably wondering how that can be.  Well, let's just say that there's more to a book than grammar and the fluency of sentences.  The plot seams to keep me interested, as it is different from the other books I have read.  I find at times I can't wait to read what happens next, no matter how predictable it may be at times.  It's sort of like waiting for your favorite part of a movie; You know that what's coming is inevitable, but you can't wait to see it anyway.  I don't think I will have difficulty with my school's assignment to critique Collins' work.  -Jessica
Twilight eat your hearts out. It is because of you that I stopped reading; wondering how books of that caliber can still get produced. But I digress...  HUNGER GAMES is a FANTASTIC read, once I started on the first page, I just simply could not put the book down. I first heard the existence of this book from watching a preview on Youtube of the upcoming move. The preview looked very intriguing, it reminded me of a Japanese movie that I watched a while ago. More about that later. I didn't want to wait for the movie and really would like to know more about the story of Hunger Games so I decided to buy this book. The moment I started reading this book, I knew I made the right choice of buying it. The storyline is fantastic, right away it captivated me into Hunger Game's world. I understood everything the main protagonist was going through, her struggles and how she prevailed. Although the decisions she made were sometimes questionable, it's totally understandable. The author made great use of every human emotions and was able to captivate me from beginning to the end. This book is highly recommended!!  On another topic, a Japanese movie called, Battle Royale had very similar premises. The basic story of this movie is that a group  of classmates were sent on an island, and only 1 can survive in 3 days. If more than 1 lives, then everyone will die. Definitely give this movie a try if you fancy this type of story line.
I was never really into this Hunger Games trilogy until my girlfriends son made me read it, I knew the premise ;kids fighting to the death, last one standing wins. I've read stories like this a few times. I compare it to Robert Heinlein's 'Tunnel In The Sky', Stephen King's 'Running Man', William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies', and especially Koushun Takami's 'Battle Royale'. Every one of those amazing in there own way.  And 'The Hunger Games' IS amazing. Worthy of the books mentioned above. Much like the 'Harry Potter' series, once I objectively began reading I became hooked. Suzanne Collins writing style is comparable to J.K Rowling. The details she gives the reader are real with feeling as well as layout.  This is not just a late teen book, it will even grab the most experienced reader. Very violent and savage,in a post apocalyptic time period where the United States is no more. It is known as Panem, the central capitol of the 12 Districts. Once which had 13, the 13th District chose to rebel against the capitol, which was not tolerated and the entire district was wiped out. And now to remind the population of the slaughter of District 13, the annual Hunger Games begin. One boy, one girl from each district in a huge arena and a fight to the death.  I flew through the book and am now a fan of a great tale of perseverance, the will to survive, kill to live, hunt to stay alive and trust those you love.
This  book had me staying up at night! The characters are young teens who live in a world that is 1984/post-apocalyptic. The main thread is that in this world, there are various provinces and a 'capital,' but people who live out in the provinces are under the thumb of the capital. They have to sacrifice a boy and girl each year to participate in lethal hunger games - where only one victor may reign. Thse hunger games serve two purposes: to keep the provinces in fear and remind them who's boss (the capital with its technological prowess) and secondly to provide entertainment to the desensitized and out-of-touch capital residents. The fierce Everdeen volunteers herself to participate and so begin the feverish and thrilling hunger games. The first book in this trilogy leaves you wanting for more and although the sequels are not quite up to par with the first book, I recommend keeping them handy. The writing is thrilling and quick. The characters are well-developed and inspire a sense of endearment; the only drawback is that Everdeen appears at times clueless and overly suspicious - but maybe that's due in part to her insecurities as a teenager. It might be natural for her to be doubtful of other people's intent (like Peeta) after growing up in a hostile environment. This was a memorable book for me that I couldn't put down. I bought the trilogy package for my sister and she loved it!
The Hunger Games series is absoultely remarkable. A great read however, I must caution parents... There is a maturity level that should be obtained and an open mind. I, myself would not let a 12 year old sit down with this book due to its content. It is a wonderful book for your 16 and up year old. You know if this book may put "ideas" in your child's head. I suggest you read the book first, then decide. A lot of parents are sceptical about the book. I recently saw the movie and the scenes in the book are more descriptive, should i say, in the book than the movie. It is definitely a wonderful read.  Other than that, this book (and series as a whole) is amazing. I haven't read a series this captivating since HARRY POTTER. It left me begging for more. Wonderful book. Will instantly hook you. As as I did, you will probably lose sleep either reading it, or thinking about it. LOL! It is that wonderful, yes. Highly suggest this . Worth the money. I loved them so much, I actually bought the hard copy of all three books (: The book worm in me. Some books you just have to have hard copies of. (:
As an avid reader with a monstrous love for dystopian novels, people have incessantly recommended this book to me over the past few years. The premise intrigued me, and I eagerly anticipated the "Lord of the Flies" style Hunger Games. As I began the book, I found my interest and excitement waning as the narrative fell into the predictable and manufactured rut that plagues so many YA novel series.  My biggest issues were with the ambiguity of the dystopia that provided too few explanations for my taste. Every sentence and description of Panem and the structure of the government had to be taken at face value and left me with a thousand questions that remained unanswered. My other problem was with the character of Katniss. As a female who grew up in an isolated town surrounded by wilderness and poverty, I thought I would instantly relate with her character. This wasn't the case. I found her nearly inaccessible and felt that her personality and character traits shifted constantly to suit the novel's overall narrative.  I think it's an excellent read for middle-school-aged children, but the material doesn't hold enough themes or thought-provoking ideas to hold the interests of an older, more thoughtful reader. I would definitely recommend it for younger readers, though it may be too simplistic for others who are well-versed in the sci-fi/fantasy genre.
I wouldn't exactly consider myself bloodthirsty, but I thought, given the edgy context--a society that puts teens in a battle to the death on live TV--Collins used a great deal of restraint actually. Based on some of the other reviews, I thought it was going to be a gruesome blood bath or something, like the massacre at the ending of Needful Things. It wasn't like that at all. I think most people who hated it are appalled by the premise to begin with, but you know what the story is before you even read it, so why buy it then? Yes, this book is intense and often disturbing, but it is not obscenely told. It's really no worse in graphicness than Lord of the Flies. (Mockingjay is much worse!) This book requires the reader to just go with it, to just except that this is how Panam is. Once you start nitpicking the reality of it actually occurring, it will ruin the read for you. Just go with and trust that it is the way it is, and if you do that, you will experience a fun ride with dark, tense and even sweet moments. My absolute favorite parts were with Rue. Peeta is pretty cool too. Those two characters infuse a lot of light to bring balance into the gritty narrative. Expect that this is upper YA in content and tone. If you are not the overly sensitive sort, you should definitely read this book. I was absorbed and read it straight through in one sitting.
I've just finished reading this novel and am incredibly impressed with Suzanne Collins' ability to see what the "bread and circuses" of the future may very well be. I'm even more impressed with her ability to write a novel set in that grim future and to create a hero, Katniss Everdeen, who is both victim and victor. In this story, written in the present tense from Katniss's point of view, I was immediately drawn into the action and felt great empathy for the people of District 12. Later, as I got to know more about the nation called Panem, which exists where North America once stood, I felt empathy for most of the other districts, even though I wasn't yet introduced to them.  The Hunger Games operates on several different levels -- as a survival novel, as a political novel, as a coming-of-age novel. On all these levels, it's uniformly excellent. The writing is smooth, the sentences lead the reader always forward. The characters (Katniss, Gale, Peeta, Haymitch, Cinna, etc.) are all well-drawn, with depths beyond what the novel's words describe. The action is almost nonstop. And, like the best of fiction, The Hunger Games is moral: it calls for taking sides for or against the rulers of Panem, for or against the workers from Distrcits 1-12 who produce the wealth but receive none of it. Highly Recommended.
When I first got this book, I put off reading if for months.  I knew it was popular, but I didn't really know what it was about, nor did I think I would like it.  I was COMPLETELY wrong.  I couldn't put it down and was reading it in class, on the bus &amp; staying up late.  Suzanne Collins has formulated a story that you can't help but want to read.  The Capitol (the controlling government) has set up a plot to keep the Districts (like States) in line and avoid uprising.  Each year, every district must sacrifice two of their children to The Hunger Games, who are "reaped" through a public drawing of their names.   The concept of The Games is simple.  Only one can survive.  The competitors must play up their skills, form short-lived alliances, and use their knowledge of the land to survive.  Oh, and they have to kill all the others, because that's how it works: for one to survive, the others must die.  This "competition" is a form of entertainment for the people in the Capitol, and viewing is forced on the districts, who supply everything to the Capitol citizens so they can have cushy lives, as a reminder of what the Capitol could do to them if they were to rise up against the Capitol.  Be warned now. This is an addictive series. If you read the first one, you're going to want to read them all!
The Hunger Games is a great book that people of all ages will enjoy. It is the first book in the series out of three. I think that the storyline is very well written and quite realistic and easy to understand. The Hunger Games is an event that one boy and one girl attend from each district. The main character, Katniss, is put into a drawing to enter The Hunger Games. Katniss ends up being chosen from District 12 after she volunteered for her sister, Prim, who was originally selected. Peeta was selected from the large group of boys for District 12. Katniss and Peeta are then sent off to start training for The Hunger Games.   The Hunger Games is a life or death situation and there is only one winner out of twelve districts. Each person has a special talent or weapon that they use to their advantage in the games. Katniss' special weapon is the bow and arrow and it comes in good use to her multiple times. Katniss and Peeta are trained by a former Hunger games winner, Haymitch, and then the Games begin. It is a very aggressive and competitive battle against people from every district. Overall I think that the Hunger Games is an excellent book for different reading levels and for anyone over seven. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a fast pace action book.
This book was very suspenseful, and the build up hardly declines in this story of fightings, journey, survival, and romance. This book was so suspenseful that at the end I read the last seven or so chapters in one night. Here's a summary:  The story takes place in the somewhat distant future (familiar to people who have read The Giver, The City of Ember, The People of Sparks, or other future-setting books), when the country of Panem rises from ruins of what was once North America. Every year, just to keep Panem under their thumb, the capitol hosts the annual hunger games. In the hunger games, two tributes are chosen from each of the twelve districts(one boy and one girl), who are forced to kill one another(while managing supernatural wilderness survival!) until one tribute, the victor, remains. Our main character is Katniss Everdeen of district twelve, the less-than-likely to win district. She is heroic and without fear of killing another tribute. She is troubled in thinking that she must kill someone from her own district, thus creating the problem of the story. Upon being the victor after a long, chaotic, and heart-breaking game, she is troubled by something she did to embarrass the capitol. The book ends here, leaving you hanging so that you HAVE to read book 2.
I will say this--The Hunger Games is a fast-paced novel that tells an engaging enough story. But that's part of the problem--it's *just* enough.  It's far superior to the last YA book series sensation, Twilight: Hunger Games has a strong, independent heroine who actually fights and has some personality; while it has elements of romance, the story truly turns on survival; it makes a few motions towards larger political issues; and it is fairly competently written.  With that said, what could have been an incredibly poignant situation--24 children forced to fight to the death--is reduced to an adrenaline rush, much like a real fight because hardly any of the contenders are fleshed out as characters. I found it hard to care about any of them except Rue, whose appeal is due to her young age. We get hints, but they're all cheap two-dimensional cartoons. Even Katniss and Peeta don't feel completely real at times. This is issue of quick-sketch writing plagues the entire book; it could easily have been twice as long without seeming overwrought if characters and cultural realities of the world were developed a bit more.  This book is as lean as the characters. An entertaining read whose hints at depth turn out to be trompe l'oeil.
I was not expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did. I purchased it to read before giving it to my son to read to make sure it was age appropriate and that he could handle the content.  I found that I literally could not put the thing down and finished this in a day!  And absolutely marvelous world is created here and you are really pulled in! The characters are so uniquely themselves and they truly are beautifully realized n the page. Yu care for them and root for them and want them to succeed and win and that in itself is such a success!  The concept is wonderful, and is filled with enough subtext to keep adults interested and thinking as well as enough drama and action to keep the younger readers thoroughly entertained.  I'm always wary of blockbuster young adult books because it seems they can fall so short sometimes, but this one really hits it so far out of the park it's amazing. Especially since this is just really stripped down, bare bones story telling. It reads so simply it would be easy to dismiss, but the thought and attention to detail paid to the entire environment and the characters in them makes this a phenomenal read. It's going to be a standout for this generation for sure.
I can only say the story is sadistic, violent and no depth. There is no growth either in storyline or the main charactor. The most disturbing thing is that so many people think such a cold blood killing full of darkness story is wonderdul. And I got really bored by reading this book, time wasted.
I never thought that I would like a books series as much as I loved the Harry Potter series, but that was before I read the Hunger Games. It has a wonderful plot, very well written, and has amazing charcters. It is about a country called Panem that used to be the United States of America which was spilt up in the 13 Districts and the Capitol that ruled over them. At one point the Districts rose up against the Capitol, the Capitol bombed District 13 to the ground and to put the Districts in their place they said that once a year each District had to send one boy and one girl between the ages 12-18 that are called Tributes so they can throw them into an arena where they are forced to fight to the death until one person is left alive. It has been 74 years since they started the Hunger Games and the stories centers around a 16 year old girl from District 12 named Katniss Everdeen who became the Tribute to keep her sister from the Hunger Games. Katniss is an amazing young woman that is brave, strong, and caring which is something rare for the heroine of a YA novel to have all at once. The supporting cast is just as good. If you are looking for a good book that you can lose yourself in, the Hunger Games is it.
I am reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.  The story takes place in the city of Panem which was once North America.  The Hunger Games are a bloody battle to the death and are the capitol's way of showing that they have power over the 12 districts of the country. Two kids from each of the districts are chosen to compete in the games each year.  The main characters are Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. They live in District 12. Katniss and Peeta, along with 22 other kids, are trapped in the arena in a battle to the death.  It was interesting to see how the different characters reacted to the horrible situation of being in the Hunger Games.  A group of kids called careers hunted down other tributes during the night and killed them.  A small girl named Rue stayed away from people and hid.  She avoided any killing.  Katniss, at the beginning, hid but towards the end of the Games she was forced to start hunting.  I would recommend this book to kids who can handle death and destruction.  If I was the author, I would not have gone into such detail with some of the deaths as they may disturb younger readers.  The Hunger Games was a very good book and I hope you consider reading it.
Wow.  Just wow.  I know I am way late to the reading party on this and I could probably (as a former teacher) write an extraordinarily lengthy review, but right now I am just in post THE END mode and am anxious to start book 2.  I must also add that while I normally am not a fan of first person style writing, and had to get past that initially, the story drew me in so deep it no longer mattered after the first 10%.  Well edited also.  I did not catch one solitary mistake.  This story is dark, disturbing and unbelievably for kids??  Published by Scholastic?  It's Dickensian and Running Man and Heart of Darkness and The Truman Show rolled into a captivating page turning tale that unnerves you and still you cannot stop reading!  Maybe my imagination fills in a lot of blanks, but I don't know that I would want anyone below the age of 15 or so reading this.  The final death is...disturbing to say the least.  So few books, especially for youthful readers feature a really strong heroine.  Katniss is that.  She is vulnerable, yet smart and calculating and still has a little bit of innocence and naivete that make you want to protect her.  GAH!  I need a time out.  For a minute.  And then on to book two.
This is phenomenal book.  When I read it I was reminded of this scene in the film Amadeus where the Mozart's music was described as 'an absolute beauty'.  See clip from the film Amadeus here.  For me &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052.The_Hunger_Games" title="The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins"&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/a&gt; was dictated by if not God, the some Angel scribe. The voice and clarity in which it speaks to the reader never failed, never erred and kept me glued to the page from start to finish.  I read the book in 36 hours flat, and was astonished by its vast vistas and effortless portrayal of an alien civilisation. It reminded me of Angela Carter: The Handmaid's Tale, most of all, but I loved the way it captured the essence of our own time with its games shows contests and sometimes extremely cruel reality TV.  A tour de force by &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/153394.Suzanne_Collins" title="Suzanne Collins"&gt;Suzanne Collins&lt;/a&gt;. If you have not read it, then clear some time in your diary and do so.  &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/26605751-sally-melia"&gt;View all my reviews&lt;/a&gt;
I read this book when I was in sixth grade. My friend was reading the book and I thought it looked pretty cool. Then he showed me something from the second book and I became interested in the whole Hunger Games thing. I read this book and immedialty wanted the second book. I spent all my free time reading this book. I couldn't stop at the end of a chapter, because at the end of each chapter is a cliffhanger and you have to read the next!!!!  The book is about 16 year old Katniss Everdeen. She lives in District 12 in the country of Panem. Every year two kids between the ages of 12 and 18 are forced to go into the Hunger Games. Katniss's little sister, 12 year old Primrose (Or Prim as they call her in the book), has been chosen to go into the Hunger Games. Katniss volunteers to take her sister's place. The second kid is Peeta Mellark, the baker's son. Katniss and Peeta are shipped off to the Capitol and are in the arena for the Hunger Games.  I would like to tell you more, but if I say too much, I might ruin it. I'm now currently on the third book and I love this series. Hope you enjoy it too.  I would reccomend this book for middle school, high school, and young adult.
After going through "Gregor the Overlander" with my 7-year-old, I was curious to see what else Suzanne Collins had penned. Upon searching, I found that there was an online fury about the upcoming release of the end of her "Hunger Games" trilogy.  I noticed displays for Hunger Games events at my local bookstore. I read some of the reviews and although it wasn't appropriate for my 7-year-old, I thought I might give it a try. I was more than slightly dubious because it was YA fiction and, to be honest, I have tried several titles that have been blissfully popular and wasn't that impressed.  This story was so well-crafted I started it on a Sunday morning and couldn't put it down until evening when I finished the book. This book is amazing.  I don't know how to describe it to others except to say there is almost every kind of conflict known to man in this book. The ideal of humanity, loss, suffering, oppression...it's all there...Will it be considered a great fiction masterpiece upside Orwell and Huxley? Hmmm...can't speculate on that, but I think it's definitely several hundred notches above some of the tepid mush that is passing for great fiction.
Wow, talk about a gripping storyline.  I'll admit I'm a sucker for post apocalyptic, end of the world fiction. This is a whole new idea to me though, brilliantly thought out and wonderfully written.  I know when a book really has me because I can spend hours reading without stopping and The Hunger Games definitely had me. When you catch yourself waiting for the chance to pick up your book (kindle) again so you can find out what happens next, then the author has really done their job.  Katniss is a brilliantly written character with just enough complexity to keep you guessing without being overly confusing just for the sake of it.  I think Peeta could have been developed as a character a little more but then maybe that's what awaits me in book #2.  I haven't read Battle Royale that people claim this copies from but really how similar could they be? There are so many intricacies to "The Games" that surely they are different and maybe it's just the basic premise seems familiar. I'll have to reserve judgment until I have read it I suppose.  I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this series, The Hunger Games was a great start to a trilogy.
The Hunger games had me from the first word. I spent the first 150 pages or so feeling incredibly anxious for the main character. I felt as if I were scheduled to be executed an hour after I woke up the next day. The sheer dreadfullness of Katniss's situation just seems to bleed out of the book. I could hardly sleep after reading.  And so the premise of the book is its real winning card. It's just such an awful thing to imagine that you're completely entranced by it. The actual execution of the story is top notch as well. The plot drags you on with such urgency. The characters are most certainly likeable, real, and relatable, particularly the main character. As a young adult book, the language is fairly simple, but definitely nowhere near embarassingly so. I really would love to see a more adult version of this, though.  There are some aspects of the premise that don't quite add up. But I refuse to deduct a star for them, because the story couldn't be as great as it is if the author tried to "fix" them. Ignore these chips in the paint and you will thoroughly enjoy this book. Probably in one night. Two tops.
Like many of the reviews posted online, I found this to be a very exciting, engaging book - enough that I finished it in two days, staying up late both nights just wanting to see where the story took me.  But first, I just want to say that I really don't like present tense for fiction.  That is the main reason why this will not be getting five stars from me.  I don't mind first person at all, but present tense just annoys the heck out of me.  But yes, back to the book!  The concept is nothing new at all(Battle Royale, The Long Walk, etc), but the author manages to put a new spin on it, making it seem fresh and exciting by putting it in a futuristic world hundreds of years in the future, adding in science fiction elements that are new for this limited genre, and making the characters come to life.  I wish it would have been more futuristic.  The book was very readable and kept me involved from the first few pages, but some of the characters seemed a little lacking to me, especially Peeta.  I didn't understand his actions at all, or his motivations.  Katniss is your typical girl in a way, but she was developed in a stronger sense.  Overall, though, there was one character I wanted to know more about - Rue.  Even though she dies halfway through, I wish the main character would have been her instead of Katniss.  The world building seems very incomplete, but there is a second book for that reason, which I hope to read soon (plenty of other stuff I have to read first, though).  I also wish a map would have included, but that's just my opinion.  Anyway, the reason this book gets four stars from me is the way it keeps you involved and keeps the reader tied to it.  At the end of the day, I want to be engaged and want to keep reading, and this book did just that, even if it was mindless entertainment.  If I wanted to learn I would actually read my schoolwork.
A Famous Person once said: "Can love bloom on the battlefield?"  The answer, in the case of the Hunger Games, is No.  The setting for the Hunger Games is in the near future, when everything has been bombed to smithereens and the only civilization left is the Capitol and its surrounding twelve Districts. Every year the Capitol forces one girl and one boy from each district into a giant arena where they fight to the death, on TV, simply to remind everyone that the Capitol is in charge. The last one standing gets fame and fortune.  Sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen is selected to be one of the victims from District 12. Her hunting skills and knowledge of the forest are helpful, but to win the support of the audience she must pretend to fall in love with her District 12 male counterpart, Peeta.  It becomes one of the most confusing love stories I have ever read.  The story itself is fine, insofar as a story about children murdering each other can be fine. There is plenty of suspense, action, outwitting of enemies, survival, explosions, and occasional humor. The setting is descriptive and the characters are well rounded. But throughout the whole book you have to also deal with a semi-fake-romance between Katniss and Peeta.  The book is written in first-person from Katniss' point of view. From the very beginning, we are told that she only puts up with the romance to get support from the rich audience, who in turn might send down helpful gifts or tools into the arena to help them survive. Unfortunately she also knows that Peeta really does like her, and so you end up with a convoluted love triangle of which one point is the entire population of the city.  It's one of those situations where the reader understands and predicts things much, much faster than the characters do. Katniss describes Peeta as a nice, generous, strong, giving, attractive person, and then spends the majority of the book annoyed that she has to pretend to be in love with him. Much of my reading was spent waiting for the eventual "Katniss eventually falls in love with Peeta" chapter.  It would be like Sherlock Holmes identifying the culprit as a large, balding man with a walrus mustache and then spending the majority of the book obliviously buying pastries from the large, balding, mustache-d baker. We are never given a reason why Katniss does not actually like Peeta, other than a weak "there's another boy back home who I am also indifferent towards" excuse.  I really want to like the Hunger Games. The story and setting are unique and interesting, and set up nicely for more in the same world. But the awkward love triangle, where Peeta loves Katniss, Katniss wants to please the audience and so pretends to love Peeta, and the audience wants to watch them die for sadistic entertainment, just makes no sense. It would be better if we were given a reason why Katniss doesn't like Peeta in return, but we never do.  And for someone named Peeta, we sure do see him eat a lot of animals.
Several weeks ago I had dinner with a writer of adult mystery novels.  During the course of the evening, she raved to me about a young adult novel she'd read called The Hunger Games.  While I don't read a lot of YA fiction, I would say that I'm more open to it than many a childless adult.  And her recommendation must have stuck in my head, because when I saw it offered through Amazon's Vine program, I jumped at the chance to read the book.  Yesterday I wrote her a thank you note because I loved The Hunger Games as much as she had, and I doubt I'd have given it a second glance if not for her raves.  The novel is set in a dystopian country called Panem--a place that was once North America.  There have been wars and uprisings in Panem's past, and now the 12 districts that make up the land are ruled over with severity by the government in the Capitol.  There are many ways that the populace is kept in its place, but perhaps the harshest is the annual Hunger Games.  By edict, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 is randomly drawn from each district to compete in a fight to the death.  The last one of these 24 left standing will win lifetime fame and fortune, and the entire nation is forced to watch these children kill each other live on television.  The first-person narrator of this gripping and fast-paced thriller is 16-year-old Katniss.  When her 12-year-old sister is selected, Katniss knows the little girl will never survive, and volunteers to take her place.  Katniss has been providing for her family for years, and has learned to show a tough face to the world.  Still, nothing could possibly prepare her for what she's about to face.  Visiting the Capitol for the first time, she experiences luxury and excess beyond her wildest imagination.  On the field of battle, she experiences the best and worst of humanity.  The premise of this novel may seem a bit worn to you.  I know that other writers have trod this territory before.  And yet... it makes a good story, these human struggles.  And Suzanne Collins has crafted a compelling and moving tale.  I can tell you that I read 384 pages in a day because I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN!  I will also admit to sobbing unabashedly at one point in the novel.  There's so much more to the story than just the fight to the death.  There is a fascinating and disturbing culture explored, complicated relationships, and complex ethical dilemmas.  You may think you know how the novel has to end, but don't be so sure.  The novelist is clever.  This narrative does come to a definitive conclusion, but there is room for more to be told in this story.  One aspect is left unresolved.  I have absolutely no idea where this is going to go (Isn't that wonderful!), but I can't wait for the sequel!
Our school librarian was able to secure a pre-publication/advance reader's copy of this book and after she read it, she shared it with me, a second-grade teacher.  (I won't be reading this to my second graders!) I had just finished reading "The Shadow Children" series by Mararet Haddix("Among the Hidden", "Among the Imposters", "Among the Betrayed", "Among the Barons") and the trilogy by Lois Lowry ("The Giver","Gathering Blue", "Messenger") and our librarian knew I liked those types of books.  I took "The Hunger Games" with me on vacation and read it in no time at all.  The action is quick-paced, and there were never any dull moments for me in this book.  "The Hunger Games" is geared toward junior high/middle school children (age 12 and up) who enjoy reading about futuristic societies, such as those in Margaret Haddix's "Shadow Children" series, or in Lois Lowry's trilogy.  The main character is a 16-year old girl named Katniss, who tells her story in the first person.  In the ruins of a place once know as North America, is a shining Capitol surrounded by 12 districts.  The Capitol forces each district to send one girl and one boy "tribute" between the ages of 12-18 to participate in the annual Hunger Games--a fight to the death on live TV. When her younger sister's name is called, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  The back cover of the book sums it up like this:  "But, if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love."  The last page of the book says, "End of Book One", which lets me know there will be a sequel...and I can't wait to read it, too!  If you know a young reader who enjoyed Lois Lowry's trilogy, or the "Shadow Children" series by Margaret Haddix, steer them toward this book.
Lots of rapid developments in the plot, which hold interest. The book suffers from the repetition and overly simple thinking of Young Adult books. Remember, a synonym for "young adults" is "old children" and a childish need for repetition and flat presentation mingles with adolescent self-involvement and hunger for a sense of the accomplishment of uniqueness.  Collins presents a brutal world, then pulls her punches when it comes to how her characters fare in it. SPOILER ALERT: the main characters kill by accident, to rescue someone else, to end a person's suffering -- they never have to face the main dilemma in the games: would you kill a person to win? This keeping skirts clean is quite typical of "old children- young adults" books. Not that there isn't some gruesome stuff in HG, just that the main characters stay pure and idealistic in a way that life would never permit.  I doubt that I'll read the rest of the trilogy, but I would probably read the second book if I happened to find a free copy lying around somewhere.
You may be doubting this book just because it is from Scholastic. But you've heard the saying don't judge a book by its cover before right? This applies well with this book. Like every good book it starts out slow but picks up rapidly. It is about a sixteen year old girl named Katniss living in the remains of what used to be North America. There is a Capitol along with it's 12 oulying districs. Every year the Capitol holds the annual Hunger Games in which two children, one boy,one girl, are sent to the Capitol and forced to participate in a bloody fight to the death. The further out you go from the capitol the more poor the districts get. Katniss is one of the few in District 12 that will defy the laws of the Peacekeepers to survive. She goes out on a daily basis to hunt and provide for her family. But after something terrible happens in her family she is forced to do something she would never think of. She will be forced to be a tribute in the Hunger Games. All in all this is a great book for all ages so if you get bored in the beginning just stick with it.
I read the author's earlier "Gregor" series, lent to me by a  then-nine-year old, and heard a lot about this series and the movie. I  finally read The Hunger Games, and immediately ordered the next book.  I love the realistic way the author handles poverty, without  idealizing it or making it seem unusual.  It's just the way things  are.  The central premise reminds me of Shirley Jackson's "The  Lottery", without the immediate gratification.  Instead we get an only  slightly more extreme version of "Survivor", reality TV where the  participants must kill each other and survive dangerous elements  thrown at them by producers.  I wasn't overly fond of the the main  protagonist, Katniss, a young but very cranky girl, and her partner  seemed a bit bland.  The book got a bit bogged down in the late stages  of the competition.  But it was an easy, if painful, read.  I'm glad I  didn't read it when I was a kid.  It's no Harry Potter, but it is  interesting and reflects on a lot of modern culture.
Phenomenal.  I'd heard it recommended, so I checked it out at the library before an appointment with friends, and started reading it right there.  Couldn't stop.  Didn't want to go meet my friends.  Read it while I walked to the car.  Read it at the stoplights on the way home.  Read five hours that night, until 3AM.  It's been a long time since I've read for five hours straight.  It was page 48 before I even realized it was in the usually annoying present tense. I didn't notice the shocking number of unnecessary comma splices until page 60, but didn't care.  Unusual premise.  Great world-building.  Breakneck pacing.  I'm not all that into action.  I often skim it.  But this kept me absolutely engrossed, despite its VERY violent and brutal premise.  I teach GED.  I told my class about it and the next time we met (5 days later) one of my students walked in with a book in front of her face.  What book was it?  "Catching Fire," the second in the series.  She'd already devoured the first.  Thank you, Suzanne Collins.  You're amazing.
I came across Collins books on a library, and looked them on the Kindle library. Being a long time fan of science fiction I identified several subjects that have been used over and over, with different degrees of success; such as post-disaster worlds, gaps in technology and power, master and subservient races (all human here though), the decadence of those in power, the showcase of death and violence as a form of entretainment.  However, the book was presented in such a way that it was difficult to put down. The narrative is clear and allows you to have a clear picture of what is happening in this world, the characters are not forcibly made to be likeable or to have heroe qualities about them; they are quite simply a couple of teens who had the ill luck to be thrown into this whole mess. That makes it all the more believable and opens the possibility to connect to the characters. The violence of the Hunger Games is not overused, and its focus on survival, and the relationships that are made within make it a hard book to put down.
Katniss Everdeen lives in a future dystopia, the nation of Panem, in what used to be North America. The country is divided into districts, and Katniss's district is one of the poorest, where most people are on the edge of starvation and she hunts and gathers to keep herself and her mother and younger sister fed. Each year, every district must send one boy and one girl to the Hunger Games, a brutal battle to the death which is televised nationally and serves as a way for the capital to keep its districts, once rebellious, in line. Katniss becomes the girl tribute from her district, along with Peeta Mellark, the baker's son, who once did a good deed for Katniss. In the Hunger Games, though, it's a fight for survival, and Katniss must decide where her loyalties lie.  Collins doesn't pull her punches with Katniss's character. She's tough and smart and pretty darn ruthless: not feisty, not spunky, just ruthless. I liked how Collins avoided what could easily have been the stock romantic plot, too, of true love conquering all, and concentrated on how vastly different Katniss's and Peeta's worldviews and mindsets are. I would have liked to get to know the other tributes a little more, but Katniss was so immediately engaging (and it's in first person anyway) that I was carried along by her, and by the breakneck pace of the plot. I'm very glad I knew this was the first of a series, or I would have had issues with the ending, which does wrap up the main plot, but doesn't address Katniss's inevitable struggle with the totalitarian government. As it is, there's certainly enough closure to satisfy, and I'm eager for the next book.
This book does a pretty good job at bringing you into a different world and introducing you to a few almost-likable characters. It was written well enough that I wanted to finish it. That being said, I found this book altogether disappointing.  1. The main character isn't likable. I was rooting for her but at the same time, but I really care about her. I realize that she is on some personal journey to find herself, but it came across as a gray and frustrating character.  2. This is the first of a trilogy. This book would have been far superior as a standalone book with some conclusions. Nothing is really concluded. It is a complete set up.  3. If you don't want to cheer when innocent children die, this is not the book for you.  4. Really? Another love triangle? There's only so much of this that I can take: "I don't know anything. I'm just a young girl and to know my own feelings is hard. The one boy is good then on the other hand the other boy is good in a different way. I will have to string them both along..."  5. The writing isn't anything special. It's good enough, I suppose. I think some details are overlooked.  6. The violence is pretty graphic, if that is a concern for you.  7. In the end, I was disappointed when the main character didn't die. It would have been more profound and noteworthy. Alas, you cannot sell two more books unless the first book is not concluded.  I think this book is worth reading if you have nothing better to do or to see for yourself what all the hype is about. In the least, this book stirred up my emotions, even if most of those emotions were frustration.
Light reading that was entertaining most of the time but its premise is too unbelievable for me. The plot description is already well described so I won't go too far in here. Just that a society as a whole would accept and enjoy watching innocent children fight to the death as a punishment for crimes committed by a distant past culture (the contest in the story is 74 years or so after the rebellion) is treated too lightly. Too make this work more believably needs much more explanation than we get, which of course is why the book fits the YA description. This story has been told before (elements of Running Man and others) so a more detailed explanation as to the how and why this is still a necessary punishment is in order. I also wasn't pleased with the way the book ends. This is written as a trilogy but being forced to buy book two to end a story I invested time in buying and reading is simply marketing strategy. A worthy trilogy sells on its merit not a cliff hanger without substance.
"Hunger Games" is a young adult science-fiction suspense novel. The premise--sending teens into a game that requires them to kill each other--also qualifies it as a horror novel, in my opinion.  The story was very exciting and fast-paced. For the first two-thirds of the story, there was barely a pause in the danger-laden action filled with unexpected twists. The world-building was very good and brought the story alive in my imagination. The characters were interesting, and there were many very nice characters risking themselves to help Katniss survive. I liked the potential of Katniss more than I actually liked her. She wanted to be nice, but she thought everyone was out for themselves so she rarely trusted others and her main goal was survival at whatever cost.  I read the book because my 12-year-old friend wanted me to, because of the suspense, and because I thought Katniss would be pushed to the point of boldly defying the evil of the Hunger Games. But her main goal was to survive and avoid conflict. Even her minor defiances stayed within the rules and she eagerly cooperated in trying to patch up any damage done by them to The Capital's power. She lied knowing it would be hurtful to someone she cared about and was willing to kill people she liked in order to survive. Only some fancy footwork on the part of the author kept Katniss from facing much moral dilemma about her actions and intentions.  By the time the Feast came about (near the end of the book), I had concluded that Katniss wouldn't stand up against the Hunger Games, no matter how cruel or how much she disliked them. By this point in the story, there were also a bunch of inconsistencies--including a critical one that meant the story wouldn't have played out the way it did.  (Explanation, SPOILER alert: Peeta said that his family only ate stale bread. Thus, Peeta's mother would never have told him to feed fresh, slightly-burned bread to the pigs--which formed the bond between Katniss and Peeta--when his family could have enjoyed the bread themselves. END SPOILER)  At this point, the pacing was also slower so I started to notice things like how fresh, unpreserved meat stayed good for days despite very hot days (it would have spoiled much sooner), how Katniss never thought to use the iodine for medicine when it might have made a big difference, how she hid some knives yet never thought to go back to get them when she needed them, and how she didn't even try to use her weapons when captured by an opponent intending to torture her to death.  In my opinion, it basically fell apart at the end, and I stopped caring about the story. Some readers might not catch the inconsistencies or care as long as there's great action, but I do.  There was no sex. I don't recall any bad language. The gore was left to the readers imagination. The novel was written in first person, present tense. Overall, it was a "clean" and exciting reading, but I was disappointed by the end.
Well, I will say this. I finished the book in about 2 days.  I found the story interesting but did not like the writing style. It is very blah. I feel this may be because it is intended for young adults. I do feel that there was a great idea here but that it could have been developed better. However, that being said, I am finishing up the series.  If you are a parent and you want to get this book for your child, I would recommend you read it first and decide whether you feel it appropriate.  Personally, I would have read this in high school, but not any earlier. It isn't appropriate for younger than 13/14 and I doubt a child would enjoy it or even truly understand it, even though I feel it is written at about a 5th grade level.  Parents can determine the maturity of their owns kids and for those parents out there who do care what their children are exposed too, please read the plot or even read the book yourself first to decide whether you find it appropriate or not.
This review is for the audiobook "The Hunger Games".  I constantly have an audiobook going, I listen in the car and while working out.  I have to admit that "The Hunger Games" is a first for me, though, in one regard.  I was so completely engrossed and immersed in this story that I didn't realize my workout time had ended and I had kept going!  I have to say that I had heard about this series some time ago, but when I read the synopsis of this book, I thought it sounded like something that was rehashed, and too violent for me.  After a good friend recommended it, I agreed to try it.  The book is very well read, and easy to follow on audio.  The only problem with this audiobook is that you might sit in your car awhile to continue listening.  Be careful, you might find yourself holding your breath at times, too.  This was a thoroughly enjoyable listen, and I have already downloaded and started "Catching Fire"....it is wonderful.  Highest recommendation.
The Hunger Games Trilogy is the most riveting series I've ever read. There is a lot of brutality, violence and death but without it, the theme wouldn't have been so strong. Ms. Collins will have you holding your breath from page one all the way to the end. I consider myself a slow reader but I devoured all 3 books in less than a week.  The protagonist, Katniss, is self-absored, and selfish and yet we find ourselves completely rooting for her because of her ultimate sacrifice of her life for her sisters. There are so many truths in this book. I love the way this author shows the horrors of war, yet also shows that there are some things worth fighting for. In today's society, we see many parallels to the world she created. I hope this fantastic story jolts some folks out of their comfort zones and has them considering the cost of war and of turning a blind eye to what we know is wrong.  Kudos Ms. Collins. Highly recommend this series to teens and adults.
I was told to read this book numerous times but I kept putting it off.  Once I decided to start it, I couldn't put it down.  I know this book is somewhat old and there are lots of reviews on it out there.  So, I will keep it somewhat brief.  Like I said I couldn't put the book down once I started it, this book was amazing!  I wasn't sure how I would like this type of book, but I loved it.  The book is well written and it draws you in from the very beginning.  I thought the characters were well developed and so was the story line.  The book completely captivates you and makes you feel like you are in the story and can completely empathize with the characters.  There were many times I felt like I was in the action and was feeling what the characters were feeling.  This is a must read and will be a book that I will recommend to anyone, young and old.  I was so excited when I found out they were making it into a movie.  I can't wait to see it!
Now I know Im gonna get hate mail for this one, I personally feel that the Hunger Games is an extremely overrated bookseries, number one reason being the writing. Suzanne's writing is symplistic and blunt, with few "scholarly" sentences to be found. Also, the fact that the novels are written in the present tense is really irritating and detracts from the writing. However, despite this, I do enjoy the story (of the first and third books). The brutality behind these novels is nice, for it does a wonderful job of dampening the overly cheesy/pointless emotional moments. I like the politicking in these books, however, and i feel that Suzanne Collins is good in terms of creativity, but her writing leaves much to be desired. Aww well, I read these books, watched the movie (which i prefer), and am awaiting Catching Fire's release in movie format (In the movie they will have to leave out some of the emotional confusion which made the book annoying).
I admit that I should have read this book long ago.  I was hesitant because I knew it was a teen read.  My 13 year-old daughter says that this series is her favorite of all time (she is a prolific reader).  My son, 16, who is also always with a book in his hands (and reads a book in a day or two that takes me weeks) loved this series.  But after having friend after friend tell me that I should read it, and knowing that the movie is coming out soon (and since I have three children we will no doubt be watching it), I finally borrowed it (as an Amazon Prime member) for free.  I could not put it down.  What a creative mind to think of these things.  Really amazing is the only way to describe it.  I am not going to bore you with plot details - the thousands of reviews already cover that, but I will tell you that I am very sad I cannot borrow another book until March 1 - my next borrow is Catching Fire - book 2.  Read it - you won't regret it.
(3.5 Stars) I wouldn't say that the writing is fantastic; don't expect to expand your vocabulary if you've made it past the 4th grade. However, it's not a bad way to spend a day, and it totally does have the can't-put-it-down factor.  Pros  - Quick read; brief and relevant descriptions that don't deviate from the story  - Strong female protagonist who isn't annoying  - Interesting blend of Battle Royale + Olympics + Survivor  - Pacing is excellent  Cons  - No justification for the actions of some minor characters (the stylists, for example)  - The amount of skill and luck that contribute to the end is quite unbalanced, assuming most readers prefer skill  - District 12 appears as the only district where individuals are capable of mind games; would have been better to get an understanding of other psychological strategies (other than historical references to past hunger games)  - They should have named Katniss' nemesis, Cliche, instead
All in all, I really enjoyed this book, up until the last few chapters which were very vacant.  The climax at the end, was not very climatic, and the last chapter, instead of a cliffhanger, really just fell flat, as if the author ran out of steam or didn't want to detract from the next book. Although the attempt was there to end the first book for transition to the second, it was presented in a more 'matter of fact' fashion, than something that grips you.  I thought at one point, that the last few chapters were actually written by a different person.  As for the rest of the book, it was very easy to read, like a teen novel and lacked a lot of flourish.  The premise of the whole 'hunger games' was really glanced over, and although it was understood, it was written as a broad concept rather than really getting into it.  This is a kids book.. It was a good read, and is what it is...
I finished this book, which I don't always do. Fortunately, I only paid $3.99 to download it onto my phone. I'm sure I won't read the two sequels. I suppose in fairness, it was written for young people, which I'm not. However, I cannot understand for the life of me how this book has remained at the top of the best seller list for so long. It's average at best. The author spends a huge amount of time describing every morsel that the main character puts into her mouth throughout the story, yet apparently never had to go to the toilet the entire time she was living in caves and trees. I always get a kick out of the writings of people about living in the wild who have apparently never actually spent much time living in the wild. She writes about land mines, with obviously no clue as to how land mines actually operate. I guess if you're writing for a ten year old, that's fine, but if you're an adult, forget this book.
The good parts of the book are that it had a good build-up and lets the reader get to know the characters and dystopia of the world before getting into the action. Also, the novel clearly shows that the author did her research pertaining to the wild plants and animals that Katniss uses to survive.   However, these minor details do not help save the novel from its major flaws. First off, the premise sounds interesting, new, and edgy, right? Well, it would if it was not used nine years earlier in Koushun Takami's Battle Royale. Granted, there are differences in the two works, but not enough to make The Hunger Games look original. Secondly, the novel challenges the reader's willing suspension of disbelief far too often. How exactly are cameras everywhere in the area without any of The Games' participants noticing? How is it that literally no one in The Capitol objects to The Games?  Why are so many of the other participants death convenient for the main characters? Last but not least, the ending of the book leaves a lot to be desired. The book reaches its climax and then cools down for a tiny bit, but rather than giving a satisfying ending, the book just ends.   Overall, the novel would not be terrible if it was not for the unbelievable parts that are not accurate explained and the fact that it is essentially a Battle Royale rip off. While the book is the first in the trilogy, I will not be continuing this series even with the few and far between good parts the novel has.
The only regret I have is that it took me so long to finally get into this book series. I've been reading a lot about how good this book is and I have read many reviews about it, yet I was undecided until I saw the trailer of the movie. The Hunger Games is so intense and mesmerizing that it is hard for me to describe how I feel about it. It is brutal, it is cruel and at the same time is so beautiful and inspiring....it is masterful really. I haven't cry so much with a book in a really long time. I love the characters and the story and it makes you feel impotent because you wish you could do something to help this kids, to change their fate...This book is like nothing I have ever read and I love it...you should read The Hunger Games, this is a story for everyone! I'm really looking forward to read the second and third book...and I'm eager for the movie!!!! I can't wait to see it!
I admit that I wasn't too excited when my book club picked this book as our next read. I'd heard just enough about the plot to make me nervous. Kids killing each other, really? I'm supposed to read this for entertainment?  I gave it a chance, and found it to be a riveting and compelling read. Violence is integral to the plot, but it's not gruesome or drawn out. This is no celebration of violence, but rather a story about what it means to be human in the face of violence. I left with a deep emotional attachment to the characters, and a concern for their welfare living under a government that keeps its society in check by forcing children into a life-and-death struggle on live TV. Questions are raised about the dehumanizing effect on the audience of watching these gladiator-like games -- apt questions in our world of reality TV shows.Thanks for this one!
I have to admit, when I first stated reading this book it was for business-related purposes to familiarize myself with the book's marketing campaign. The premise really didn't sound feasible to me with gladiator children thrown into an arena to fight for the lives until only one child out of 24 young "tributes" was left standing. I had a really hard time grasping the concept of the book, but admittedly, I was sucked into this post-apocalyptic world of fantasy as I found myself relating to the character, Katniss, protecting her sister by taking her place as their district's tribute, wanting to stick it to the man so to speak, otherwise known as the gamemakers, and fighting for survival. It's a brutal book with lots of violence and cliffhanger chapters that make your want to keep reading until before you know it, you've finished the book and ready for the next.
If you've ever seen the movie, or read the book: Battle Royale the premise of this story will seem familiar:  In the distant future after a major war, North America split into 12 Districts which are run by The Capitol.  Every year, as a reminder of the District's failure, the Capitol draws two children from each of the 12 Districts - one boy, and one girl - to compete in a live televised event known as the Hunger Games.  The goal of the Hunger Games: Survive to feed the starving people within your District with your winnings.  However, winning is not so simple.  Only ONE contestant - one child - can be the winner.  I read all 3 of these books back-to-back in a total of less-than 6 days. Thats how much I was drawn in, and the story made me feel feverishly-compelled to know what was happening RIGHT NOW.  No.waiting.allowed. &gt;.&lt;  It's been awhile since I read a book that I became so emotionally involved in, I wanted to throw it when things got too tense or scary, and I cried when I became overwhelmed. I also had a lot of LOL moments. **laughs in empty room** **looks around awkwardly**  I'm interested to see how this will turn out as a movie with so many kids bloodied and fighting for survival. I know they did it with Lord of the Flies (which scared the crap out of me as a kid), but I'm sure Thr Hunger Games will be targeted to the YA audience, which means a PG-13 rating, as opposed to the R-rating of LOTF.  Still excited though.  TL;DR -  I really loved this series.  - May the odds be ever in your favor.
I rate this book six out of five stars. I really don't see how anyone could not like this book. The Hunger Games is the absolute best book that I have ever read. I reccomended it to all of my classmates (and even my parents), and they read all of the books and absolutely LOVED them. It is perfectly paced, brilliantly plotted, and is entertaining on every page. Almost all of the characters are likeable (Haymitch, for example, is not), and the way it is written is so descriptive, so real, that it's almost like you're Katniss Everdeen, and when she feels something, you feel it too. The thrill and suspense in the book keeps readers on the edge of their seats, wondering what's going to happen next. I would reccomend this book to anyone; it is an amazing story about frriendhip, betrayal, trust, and survival. This book is for (almost) anyone.
Unfortunately, The Hunger Games leaves us hungering for a believable story.  Not only is the setup pretty wild -- *spoilers* -- a future society divided into districts and "controlled" through a barbaric annual ritual involving the random selection of one young person to participate in a sort of gladiatorial combat for the entertainment of television viewers, with the lone survivor's region blessed with abundance and everybody else taught a lesson in power.  I can tell that the author isn't a parent, because she fully lacks an understanding of the parental instinct, i.e., parents would never let their kids be sacrifices for meaningless entertainment venues like this.  So the setup is a hard pill to swallow.  But let's get beyond that and suppose we suspend our disbelief for a bit.  The main character is wholly unlikable.  She is selfish, for the most part, though she does end up making some good choices almost by accident.  She seems to get into the entertainment aspect of the competition, playing the part and acting out for the crowd's pleasure.  I'm highly skeptical that this is what anybody would do in that situation.  In short, the writing is off the mark for science fiction because it lacks a basic understanding of human nature.  That said, I gave it three stars for creativity, if for nothing else.
In this post apocalyptic world two children from each area are sent to fight for their lives as 'tribute' in the hunger games. Katniss takes the place of her younger sister and enters the games. Here she must fight and kill in order to return home and have the luxury of seeing her family never go hungry again.  The book is Death Race meets Logans Run with a touch of Survivor thrown in for good measure. It's a well thought out plot with and interesting characters who are believable and well drawn. Although morals and the consequences of the decisions you make are the essence of the book Collins handles this adroitly. Well worth a read, a good teen/young adult book, its great for both sexes and has a gripping story line. Read it before you see the movie.

I picked up this book, after reading a few suggestions on the internet, including a suggestion from Stephenie Meyer.  The book is fantastic.  Yes, it has romantic elements, but the story is so much more than that.  It's political, thought provoking, heart wrenching, brutal, and powerful.  It really has the chance to really make a generation that cares more about text messaging and other frivolities really think about what's right and wrong not just for the individual but for the whole of a country.  It is not for the feint of heart, children kill each other, but the bigger picture is worth the read.  The characters are so perfect, you love the ones that you're supposed to love and hate the ones you shouldn't.  Suzanne Collins to me wrote a great novel, well.  When I saw the new Star Wars trilogy, I was able to see what George Lucas was doing.  Around all the cheese of Jar Jar and the whininess of Anakin, he was trying to make the audience remember something about government.  That when the people get complacent, our liberties are taken away from us.  The world Suzanne Collins created does this on a much more poignant level.  She doesn't throw it in your face, but she really makes you, the reader, think about what you truly believe in.  I highly recommend it.
I read the book at a friends suggestion and i found the book to be a bit of a catch 22. It's fun but dull at the same time, great setup and premise but emotionally hollow, action driven yet quite actionless.  the problem with the characters is that they feel pretty flat with no real substance to them.  The emotions feel forced or hollow and all though the main character was likeable enough she is not really enjoyable to read as almost all her internal dialuge(which you spend most of the book reading) and emotions turn out to be either angery, aggressive and negative or glass-half-empty, pessimistic and depressed. She always finds a cloud in the silver lining.  Also it's a catch 22 in that it's hard to put down and a fun page turner but has many dull parts.  Even the last half when the games are taking place, the action only occures in small short bits with most of the games spent listening to the pessimistic thoughts of the main character dragging the book out and slowing down the pace to being almost dull.  All in all I'd suggest you give it a try as it is a pretty good book and an easy read but it leaves you wanting the book to be a bit more, have more substance and shifting from 3rd gear to overdrive which never really happens.
Since this book is under the genre "young adult' I was hesitant. I am so happy that I gave it a shot. It evokes emotion in a way that lingers with you long after you've put the book down. If you read and interperate it 'literally', it will disappoint you. Maybe even depress you. Scratch that. It WILL depress you (ya know, like going to see that movie whose trailer looked deep and inspiring and ends up being painfully sad for no reason. Is it too much to ask for a happy ending these days?) If you don't put it in a box it will, first- make your life look, eh, not really all that bad and, second-make you look deep inside and ask 'what would I do'. The answer, well.......that depends on you. Btw, if you're not that 'deep' of a person (be honest, you know who you are) you won't be thrilled. Enjoy
This book is utterly and unarguably one of the best books I have ever read. Collins does the most fantastic job describing and creating pictures of events that make me feel that I am there. When Katniss is in a tough bind, I can literally feel the adrenaline pumping fiercely, and visualize everything. For a long while I lost interest in a lot of books, and I think this is the most engaged I've ever been in a book since fourth grade. I can't put it down, and the sheer genius it posesses is incomparable. The way that this post-war and apocolyptic-like society runs raises so many questions that I bet she double sewed over the complex weave of the story to prevent any plot holes at all. This book is a ridiculously addictive read and I reccomend it to anyone and everyone, no matter who you are.
My 13 year old daughter's friends were reading this book and recommended it to her.  We couldn't find this book in any any of the bookstores near our house or any of the libraries either, they were all out and most were already on reserve.  I ordered this book from Amazon and received the book 2 days later.  My daughter read it first and couldn't put it down.  Between homework, school, soccer and meals....  she always had the book in her hands reading.  As soon as she finished she handed it to me and told me that I must read it too.  A few parents of some of her friends told me that they read it too and they all liked it as well.  I started reading and couldn't put the book down either.  Finished reading it in record time.  Have now passed on to a friend of mine to read as well.
I haven't been so engrossed by a book in a long, long time. Without giving spoilers (and if you want those, there are many reviews on here that you could read), I'd say this book left me hungry for more. Starving, actually. The day I finished "The Hunger Games" I ran out and bought its sequel, "Catching Fire" as well as the third book, "Mockingjay". Normally I just check out books from the library, but I had to own these ones. They're that good.  Keep in mind that "The Hunger Games" is a Young Adult book, which means it's geared at teens ages 14 to 21. Some people seem to think the violence in this book was a bit too much for younger readers, and they're right. But that's why this book is Young Adult--NOT Juvenile (there is a difference). If you're a parent, take note of this.
It's a fun read and certainly a page turner. But that's mostly it. I enjoyed reading it, couldn't put it down, and finished it in under a day; however, when I did finish it I wasn't satisfied as the book (and characters) felt hollow. This is perhaps a result of two factors: 1) the book comes highly recommended by nearly everyone, and more importantly 2) I had no idea it was a teen fiction book until after I finished it. Considering it's teen fiction, I suppose the fact that there were far too many implied points that were unnecessarily mentioned by the narrator (or the narrator says points in a way that tries to make it sound insightful to the reader, which they were not) and too many words were italicized for effect are justified (but they were frequently annoying while reading).  Due to its entertainment value, I'll give it a solid 3 stars and recommend it to people who are looking for a quick, easy read  - perhaps a book you'd take to the beach (though my recommendation so far to people I've spoken with about the book is that they're probably better off just waiting for the movie to come out). But if you're looking for something insightful and thought provoking, I'd look elsewhere.
I read The Hunger Games last night. It was a good thing that my husband was out of town because once I started I had to finish. I turned the light off just after 3 am. I've been hearing so much about The Hunger Games and I've been curious to see if it could live up to the hype. While it is not "the best book I've ever read", I did enjoy it. It is thrilling and consuming, gripping,and engaging--essentially, a can't-put-it-down read.  Combining themes from "The Most Dangerous Game" by Richard Connell, "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson and Orwell's "1984", this recent dystopian novel is like a more entertaining blast back to high school English class. I was impressed that even through the themes are dark the main characters maintain their humanity.  Well done.
It was hard to not read this book. I had heard so much about it and wanted to read it before seeing the movie version. It took me about 1/3 of the book to get hooked but then I could not put it down.  The author does a good job getting her point across without preaching. I felt that the characters were well-drawn and compelling. Katniss with her maturity in the area of survival but her cluelessness when it came to boy/girl relationships, was the most compelling of all. I appreciated the fact that the author did not make her cynical and jaded.  All in all, it is a heart-breaking, thought-provoking book and I would highly recommend it to everyone. I will definitely read the other two books in the trilogy and look forward to seeing the movie.
The Hunger Games is a perfect mix of romance, buried in action and conflict. After months of thinking about getting it and reading it before the movie comes out, I ordered it and finished it in two days. It's been a while since I've picked up a book and used ALL my free time just to find out what happens next. Katniss is a good heroine, although she is very self absorbed throughout the story, of course it is her story so I guess she can do that. The story didn't go the way I thought it would but then became clearer as the book progressed. Suzanne does a great job of making her environments and emotions pull the reader in. A great read. I am almost finished with the second book and it is just as good as the first. I recommend this to any reader, young or old.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a transfixing, thrilling read.   The Hunger Games is a novel revolving around a yearly mandatory event known as the "hunger games." These games serve as a reminder that the districts must do as the Capitol demands. Children chosen to participate in the games range in age from 12-18 and are decided at the "reaping," a district occurrence where names are called at random. Each district has to send one boy and one girl as a competitor in the games.  Only one person can survive the game which consists of a battle to the death. The trials and tribulations of the children, or "tributes," are many; from gathering food, water, shelter and most importantly staying alive.  Two protagonists, Katniss and Peeta are two contenders that will have your heart and keep you reading fast and furious to see the outcome.  No interruptions will be tolerated because not only is the plot engrossing but the characters are endearing, people whom you'd like as friends. There is some violence in this book but nothing too explicit or too bloody.  Waiting for the second book will surely necessitate discovery of some top notch authors!
It took me a while to decide whether or not I want to read this trilogy. I was skeptical of all the hype, because of the Twilight craze that suddenly swept the nation and I thought that this series would be another waste of trees.  I was wrong.  As soon as I started reading I was captured by the story. I don't know what it is about Collins writing but I just could not put it down, of course I had to for work and school but as soon as I had a chance to I was cracking it open and reading more and more. This book impressed me in its simplicity and in its underlying message. Collins has written a stirring first-person narrative and didn't let any of her side characters fall by the wayside. Hunger Games is easily my second favorite book.
**May contain spoilers below**  I liked this book.  I wanted to love it.  I haven't read the other two yet, and maybe it holds up better when considered as a whole instead of just its parts.  The premise is great, very controversial.  It makes you wonder what you would do if you were thrown into an arena with 23 other people, knowing only one of you would survive.  Would you kill another person?  A friend?  A child even?  How would you survive?  How would you cope in that environment?  I really enjoyed all of the lead-up to the games, with the interviews, the training, the reaping.  It is well-organized and flows well, and I found that as I got into it, it was becoming harder and harder to put the book down.  Mrs. Collins does a good job of creating a world that is in such a state of decline.  She does well to not try to over-explain things.  I can understand how, after 74 years, the people are so beaten down and controlled that they just accept the Games without a fight.  What else could they do?  How can they fight such a strong enemy that controls all of the resources?  How else would they be punished if they attempted another rebellion?  The book becomes even better as the games begin and the action intensifies.  It's great discovering what a survivor Katniss is, how all of her hardship and self-reliance has essentially trained her to be the ultimate competitor in the Hunger Games.  I was also intrigued by the strategies of her competition in the arena.  I wouldn't think that such an environment would lead to alliances, since you could never truly trust anybody knowing that only one of you will survive, but it made for some interesting interaction among the group of competitors.  It was an interesting mix of people with varying skills and abilities.  For me, the book started to flag in the last third.  Too much focus was put on the feigned (or is it...) romance between Peeta and a dim-witted Katniss.  Too much time spent looking for shelter, licking wounds, hunting, and fishing.  Ok, she's very resourceful in the wild, we get it.  I wanted more time with her interacting with the other competitors.  That's what it's all about, right?  The story was ripe with opportunity to put Katniss in more controversial situations, but I think Mrs. Collins became scared of her own story and what her own heroine may have been capable of.  Or maybe she was scared of making her unsympathetic.  For example, what if Foxface hadn't eaten the berries - would she have killed her eventually?  What if Rue hadn't been speared - would she have killed her eventually?  What if she had encountered Thresh again, rather than him being conveniently killed off while Katniss was off fake-kissing Peeta?  How would she have handled him?  How would she handle anybody that wasn't a slam-dunk "oh yeah, that guy deserves to die!"?  Other than fake-double-suicide?  Maybe Mrs. Collins will address more tough situations such as these in her next two books.  I'm betting she's going to dedicate a good portion of time focusing on the love triangle she has worked hard to set up.  Which could be intriguing.  But it wouldn't be anything we haven't all read before.  And then what a waste of a great premise!  There's a lot more I could say about what I liked or didn't like about this book.  Clearly if you like it at all you have to read the rest of the trilogy, which is exactly what I intend to do.  It's definitely a good read and I'm looking forward to seeing how the story continues to unfold in "Catching Fire".
This book is unbelievably unique. I'm not usually a fan of dystopian fiction, but the imaginativeness of Suzanne Collins is just incredible. She pulls you into a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world that's so incredibly real and complete; she's worked everything out to the tiniest detail. This gives the book immense believability. And the storyline... it's almost impossible to put the book down. I also LOVED the main character, Katniss; it was so incredibly refreshing to have a female heroine who's so strong, so single-minded, and very flawed, yet in a way that makes her even stronger. Literature needs more characters like this! I absolutely cannot WAIT for the movie to come out; my only fear is that it won't do the book justice.
Except that my daughter (who is an adult and quite pushy when she puts her mind to it) harrassed, nagged, and generally made a pain in the butt of herself until I agreed to read it. She reminded me of how I had harrassed, nagged, and made a pain of myself in order to get her to read The Stand by Stephen King. In both cases, we found ourselves enchanted, albiet reluctantly. While technically a book for young adults, the themes here are universal, without being preachy. The writer's touch is deft and subtle, and her characters demand the focus rather than their circumstances. Their situation is horrific, but somehow you walk away thinking more of the characters than the world they inhabit. That's rare...and I liked it. Damn it.
I read this book for my language arts class, as probably hundreds of classes are doing, and I was hooked from the beginning. There are real emotions, real characters, and real fears involved. After reading this book, which I read for myself after the announcement that we would be reading it,my only issue is that it was a really easy read. I hate books that are so simple to read that all 300+ pages can be read in an hour.  I loved it, though. The absolute greatness of it compensated for the easy reading level. While reading it, I slipped into its fictional grip and allowed it to replace my reality and turn everyday life into silly fantasy. But i cant get over its easy level,so 4 stars. I would have done 4.5 if I could have.
The first book in The Hunger Games trilogy introduces the reader to all of the major players including the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, her best friend, Gale, and her co-conspirator in the Games, Peeta.  Katniss lives in the poverty stricken coal mining District 12 ruled by The Capitol.  When we're first introduced to Katniss she is a tough 16 year old girl who provides food for her mother and little sister, Prim, by escaping to the meadow where she hunts for game with Gale.  Katniss is alarmed by the way Gale talks about The Capitol, fearing they will be overheard.  Speaking against The Capitol is a death sentence.  But Gale is a young man full of rage and fury against the wealthy, privileged residents of The Capitol who live off the 12 outlining districts and he will not be silenced.  When Prim is chosen to be a contestant in the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place setting a chain of events in motion that will forever change The Capitol and all the districts.  The first book is about the Games.  Katniss and Peeta (who was also selected to participate) are prepped, groomed and trained.  We are introduced to each of their prep team's including Cinna.  Haymitch (a former victor) is their mentor but proves a difficult person to work with since he's a raging alcoholic.  When Katniss and Peeta enter the arena they are forced to kill or be killed.  Only one person will be the victor in this violent, deadly game.  This is a great trilogy of books with a strong, fearless young woman as its central figure.  Suzanne Collins has created a heroine and strong literary role model for females.  I highly recommend this book.
I'm picky on the stories I invest my time in... So I have a tendency to be harsh and focused... But this story kept me drawn in until the end... I was completely absorbed, finding myself becomeing angry and sad at Katnis story... My only wish is that I could have seen the reaction of what was happening from those she loved back in District 12. However, I realize this is her story and to be told from her point of veiw... Now I have only read this first book so I can't speak for what happens later on in this trilogy... But for book one, I can highly recommend it for anyone that loves a great story that pushes on your emotions and heart... Eaisly five stars.
This was just spectacular. I'm speechless...  Brutal, raw, emotional. The world Suzanne Collins created is so magically scary that I couldn't put down the book as I was more and more involved in the story and enchanted by the beautiful writing. The characters are developed to the full; the scenes are described magnificently. I felt I was in that arena, watching the fightings, the killings and all the drama.  How on earth does someone come up with such an idea for a book I don't know, but God Bless.  I was fortunate enough to start reading the book when the following two installments were already out, because otherwise I don't know how I would have waited.
First, the writing was 'technically' good.  The story flowed along drawing me in.  All basic story-telling techniques were skillfully employed.  However I found this book lacking in some ways.  Character Development -  Even though we live in the head of the main character her inner psychology comes off as cliche despite the extrordinary circumstances of the premiss.  Analysis -  Again, the premiss seems to promise insight into human nature and society but falls short.  Vonnegut's books famously lacked full psychological character development but made up for it with deep dark smart subversive satire.  This is a well written tween book.
While the story did keep my attention, I found it to be way too predictable. The suspense is based in whether the main character lives or dies, which is fairly obvious to the objective reader. It would hardly be a popular series if the main character died a grizzly death. Being jerked back and forth in the emotional rollercoaster of "Oh my God! We're all going to die!" and "I think I'm falling in love," is repetitive and tiresome. The ending was definitely contrived to entice you into buying the second book, rather than being written with concern for telling the story. It felt like the 5:00 teaser for the 6:00 news.
This book is titled under YA but written so well it would entertain any book reader at least young teen of age.  This book packs all kinds of feelings into one.  Laughter, fear, anger, remorse, and romance all in one book.  Characters are well written and easily relatable.  Fantastic book, best book I have read in awhile.  Already reading the second one and can't wait for the third.  Finished it in a new personal record time.  I can't stop reading.  Suspenseful.  I wish I could give you more details about the book, but I don't want to spoil anything.  Gotta read it.  Don't be fooled of the YA category.
It's a shame this book has been classified as a Young Adult novel, as it is much better written than a lot of books tailored for adults!  Any sci-fi fan would love this story, the parallels between it and our reality TV is way too close for comfort, and the political and social aspects are too familiar as well.  This is a real page-turner, and I look forward to reading the next book in the series.  I only have one complaint - the character names are really silly (Katniss, Gale, and Peeta - the latter of which reminds me of the animal rights organization PETA).  Otherwise, a nice, fresh read for all ages.
Like a jerk I read these books backwards - first 'Catching Fire,' then 'Hunger Games' - but I can honestly say it worked out all right. Even though I already knew these characters by the time I approached this book, I was still able to come away feeling freshly vitalized by them, and that's saying something. It's a pitch-perfect story told with energy and focus that maintains a terrific arc.  Potent - compelling - and original. My only cavil is there are some pretty dumb editing mistakes in here, including the use of the word 'vice' when the word 'vise' was clearly meant to be used. Come on!?
Got a recommendation for this book from a waitress at Pier 500 in Hudson, WI while on a meet-up with my book club.  I admit, I was completely skeptical because I am not that into fantasy and all that.  But I loved the characters in this story and this book is like the kind of book that you can't wait to get home to read!  Loved it!  Can't wait to read the next book.  It was an unexpected escape into another world.  I loved Katniss.  This story has romance, adventure, heroism, love, courage...I could go on and on.  I highly recommend it.  A really nice surprise.  I can't wait to see the movie.
I was hooked when I read the book jacket's description -- what a great concept!  Then, as I started reading, I couldn't put it down --- the characters are very well written, and the pacing keeps you going and going to find out what happens.  I appreciated that Collins did not make things too easy for the characters, and that it wasn't necessarily a happy read, which made it feel very real.  I also liked that she threw in futuristic elements, such as the man-made mutated birds, etc.  All in all, a definite thumbs up for this book -- and something I will be recommending to a lot of people.
I read this book upon the recommendation of Stephanie Meyer, author of the Twilight series of books even though this isn't the kind of book I typically would seek out at the library.  THANK YOU MS. MEYER! The Hunger Games had me engrossed from the first page.  I was very intrigued with the characters, especially Katniss, however, the development of all the characters was impressive. The complexity of each character was described so well that there really weren't any that I didn't love and hate at the same time.  The story itself is scary...to think that such a concept could be born and carried out is unsettling, but, unfortuantely believable.  I'm not a person who likes blood and gore and this book is sometimes violent and gory, however, not to the point that I was too grossed out to read on.  The romance added just enough additional struggle to keep me addicted.  I would classify The Hunger Games writing as excellent.  As you read you can easily visualize the characters and what's taking place. I am sooooo looking forward to the second book.
The Hunger Games takes place in a future dystopic North America, where (as penalty for a previous rebellion) each of the twelve districts is required to give up two randomly selected teenagers to the participate in a televised fight to the death. The story is told, in a first person point of view, by Katniss, the female competitor from the poor District 12. She and her fellow competitor, Peeta, are wined and dined in the Capitol, primped and preened for the audience, and then finally dropped into the arena to kill and hopefully survive. Various alliances are formed, competitors are brutally murdered, and in the end a rebellious statement is made to the ruling Capitol.  The plot is generally compelling, and I found myself reading on even as I was unconvinced by it. (For example, District 12 has around 8000 people, the size of a small town, and yet it digs enough coal to fuel all 12 Districts and the Capitol?) There is enough drama, brutality and anxiety to make even a slightly interested reader curious as to the outcome, but our heroes kept getting off easy, not having to make the compelling life and death decisions that the other contestants were making; things just worked out around them. Then comes the end and it's a cliffhanger of sorts, a "buy my next book" ending, if you will, instead of just wrapping it up. I didn't appreciate that obvious ploy.  I have never been a fan of stories told in the "simple present" verb tense, and the author shifts subtly here and there, unable to keep it up herself, creating a distracting method of storytelling that takes away from the actual story. Granted, this is a YA book, and the intended audience might not be so grammatically picky, but it was a problem for this reader.  Katniss herself was not, to me, a sympathetic character. Her moods and personalities were too extreme; she felt like a larger than life character, rather than a believable hero. Peeta was easier for me to sympathize with, even though he is only seen through the eyes of Katniss. He came across less of a stock character and more real. Many other characters (just for instance: Prim, beloved by everyone; Gale, the boy that is good at everything; Rue, the ethereal fairy child) seemed very much like stock characters, seen in most fantasies, fairy tales and moral stories.  Overall, the story Ms. Collins is telling is certainly an interesting one, but there were just enough snags in it to keep me from finding it a good read.
I'm not really a reader - more of a movie person.  In fact, this is the first book that I've been able to complete in over a year.  While that should be compliment enough, I would still like to explicitly recommend this book to everyone. It is written simply but elegantly. Collins sucked me in and had me emotionally involved with the characters in this imaginative tale of survival and love set in a brutal world. I can't say much more than "simply fantastic". If you want to pick up reading as a new hobby, this is the place to start.
As a woman in my 30's I was somewhat reluctant to start this series, but it was strongly recommended to me so I gave it a try, and I'm SO glad I did! The story grabs you immediately and continues to keep your attention through the very last page, making me grateful that I had ordered all three books so I could keep reading. The details of the storyline are very well thought out and have you thinking beyond just the words you are reading. It quickly became one of my favorites and I can't wait to see how it all plays out!
There are so many reviews that have covered the story line so I'm not going to bother. I purchased these books through the Kindle.  I just want to comment that I'm in my 40's and I enjoyed this series very much.  It has great characters, a lot of action, and it's a fast read. I hope the movie stays close to the story line. If it's successful and well received then "Catching Fire" and "The Mockingjay" will most likely be made into movies as well. "The Hunger Game" books are as wonderful as the "Harry Potter" books are.
I absolutely LOVE the Hunger Games.  I do a  lot of reading and the Hunger Games remains one of the best books I've read in the last several years.  I wanted to write a review specificlly to those who may haven ventured here due to the hype that the upcoming major motion picture has been getting.  Even if you're not big into reading, I'm pretty confident that you'll have NO PROBLEM blazing through this book, and then Catching Fire, and then Mockingjay.  Try out this trilogy tour-de-force, you won't regret it!
I imagine Katniss' character can easily be made to be annoying in the movie adaptation of Collins' novel because there are so many aspects and thoughts to the character that can't translate to film, but she is deeply intricate and makes you believe her disbelief of Peeta.  Collins carefully guides the reader through all of Katniss' emotions and you feel like you're with her.  I was thrown off by the story being told in the present tense, but quickly adjusted.  I'm looking forward to Catching Fire.
This is the most moving story I have read in a very long time.  I could not help but cry reading through it and had my heart in my throat hoping that Katniss and Peeta make it out alive. But mostly hoping that Katniss does in fact fall in love with Peeta.  I cannot rate this book highly enough and feel it deserves more than 5 stars.  One thing I would like to mention is that the story is quite gruesome and I do not feel it is suitable for those under 18. Its too close to reality.
My usual reading is non-fiction -- typically with a half dozen books in various states of progress.  When I do read fiction, that's almost never after having seen a movie based on the book.  This time, though, my wife loaned me (thru Kindle) her Kindle version.  Although I knew where the plot was going, I was not disappointed.  If you enjoyed the movie(s), you are very likely to enjoy the book -- probably even somewhat more.  (Katness is memorable from either medium.)
I read all three of these in 6 days, I couldn't put them down!  They have just a hint of romance for the girls, but I could definitely see men reading them too. The dystopian world she creates is near enough to reality that you can picture the terrain and imagine the villages, but far fetched enough that you can immerse yourself into the fantasy of the capitol. It has the action of the games, the love side story, and the political backdrop - what's not to love?!
I didn't start reading this book until after the hype had died down, and the movie was already out. I thought that I would pick it up as one of my first dystopian novels.  I absolutely loved this book!  The concept was unique and different that it kept my wanting to read more!  I ended up reading this book in only a couple of days before ordering the sequel!

This book was addicting. It was thrilling. It kept you at the edge of the seat. At first, you can tell that the story came from old ideas, which deterred me for a second. From the Lottery, Brave New world or to movies such as the Gladiator.. and she gave them a fresh twist. Added plenty of gore, action, suspense, confused love triangle, family issues.. it has lots to keep you locked into this story. The characters are relatable and realistic. It read fast and I couldn't stop. Something was constantly happening. No slow parts. Imagery was wonderful! The ending made me hunger for more. Very excited for the next two books that are to follow!
One of the best books I have ever read! NO spoiler alerts here. Living in a near distance future, the United States has turned into a semi-post apocolyptic setting with 13 individual states. The rich and wealthy live life free of any problems, while the poor struggle for survival in these 13 states outside of the central capital. Murder, Deceit, love, passion, caring, and other emotions come into play during this amazing reading of a lifetime.
I loved this book.  If I didn't have kids I would not have put this book down.  My favorite thing about this book is how the author did not give any pauses in the story line.  You know in some novels when the author will build the suspense and then something major happens and the next chapter has the main character safe leaving you guessing for awhile.  I just loved how it flowed and can't wait to read the next book and the book after that.
I am 62 (the wife of James) and read this book when I borrowed it from my daughter.  I didn't know what to expect, since it is in with The Twilight Series for the younger generation.  I couldn't put this book down.  It's full of romance, adventure, decision making, doing what is right, survival, you know, all those great things that we learn from living.  I recommend it to ages 13 on up.  Hope they make a movie!  James is reading it next!
Ok, so I may be late but I haven't watched the movie because I've been waiting to read this both along with the others. This book was worth it! It had me happy, devastatingly sad and worried about people who aren't real. This book is so engaging. All I can say is read this book and you will fall in love and want to protect so many characters that you don't know which way your heart will take you. Just read this book. See you in book two!
I was absolutely in love with this trilogy, and I am already considering re-reading the first book since I loved it so much.  I read all 3 books in about 4 days on my down time.  Normally I read a book a week but I could not put this series down. There is alot of action so I think it is a good series for both male and female readers.  Suzanne Collins makes you feel as though you are in the arena with Katniss, definetly a must read!
Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer.  I absolutely loved this book. Originally I thought these books were for teens. I am 64 and this book was recommended by a 55 year old friend. She said this book was impossible to put down and she was so right. I love the central character Katniss a young independent smart and capable lady. The post apocalyptic world in this book is fascinating and scary. Anyhow loved it!!!!!!!!!
This book was recommended by a friend. As I started asking around, every person whom read this series did so in a week. Basically, they couldn't put it down.  I'm mid-way through this book and couldn't agree more. By Sunday, I will be done with the series. Absolutely a fantastic book that does a great job of mixing primal survival with new-age technology with a main character that is easily related to.  Get the book!
This book was creative and well written.  The story isn't at all a sound-a-like to anything else I've ever read. You relate to Katniss, but are also intrigued by the idea of existing in a world like the one she does in this story. This pulls at your heart strings, especially once they start "the hunger games". You also can see human flaws in their ugliest form in this book. Very interesting perspectives on things.
Where to begin with my review of this book! I simply loved it and had to stay up until 2 in the morning to finish it- I literally couldn't put it down! This book is written so well and is not like any other book I have read. I really felt for the characters and became so involved with them. It is rare to find a book like this one. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, do not let the genre take you aback.
Absolutely fantastic! I'm not a committed book reader (I have a bookshelf full of bookmarks, as my partner points out) but read this one in less than three days. Couldn't put the book down no matter how hard I tried. Stayed up way too late to keep finding out 'just a little bit more.' This has left me with a couple of very tired days at the office...well worth it. Highly, highly recommended.
It has been a long time since I've been unable to put a book (or Kindle) down.  This trilogy was amazing!  Definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat - waiting to figure out what will happen next.  SO good.  I'm glad I read the entire trilogy before the movie comes out.  My only worry is that the cast will not match up to the characters I envisioned in my mind.  Highly recommend!!!
I am reading this book for the second time and it is even better. Oh my gosh Suzanne can write so amazingly well. This book is great, and I don't understand how anyone can give it a one star. The characters are sympathetic, the situations vary from tragic to funny. It is incrediblly quick paced, where I did not skip any pages. It was great all the way through. Great great great book.
This book for me started out as a suggestion from a few friends, and as I began I found myself not being able to put it down. I put off school work to read the trilogy and I want everyone I know to read them. I have never felt so compelled to continue a book in my life, but these are simply some of the best books I've ever read. PLEASE READ. You will not be able to put them down!
I'll admit that when i started reading the first chapter, I didn't know what type of book to expect. I was so pleasantly surprised! I fell in love with this book! Suzanne Collins is not an author I had heard of before, but can tell you that I have become a follower. A great read for someone who loves fiction that doesn't go over the edge of reason. Believable. Wonderful!
This book is quite disturbing but is a great story.  There are situations that haunt me as an adult so I would never recommend this to a child or even young adult.  Maybe it is more disturbing if you have children of your own but it makes a sad statement about today's youth that they are so desensitized that this would pass as entertaining reading material for them.
I can understand why preteen girls might like this first book. But when I read that an English teacher was basing an entire semester around these books, I was flummoxed. This is not literature, especially book 3. Speaking as an English teacher, I would allow students to read this for an outside reading assignment, However, in class, I would provide examples of higher level lit. All that aside, the main character Katniss drove me crazy. She is not likable, she is clueless, and really I was not at all emotionally invested in her. Spoiler alert: this is the best of the three. She should have left it here; a tidy ending that resolves the main conflict of the novel and leaves the rest to the reader's imagination.
I recently purchased this book for my daughter.  They were reading it in school and she just had to have a copy to read ahead.  It is unusual that she gets so excited about reading so I purchased it immediately.  She has been reading it to me as we drive around town and even I LOVE it!  I would highly recommend it to all ages ... middle school and above.
The Hunger Games is a dark tale, but it is told well.  I won't bother summarizing the book because it's so popular and has been made into a film, so most people know what it's about.  I'm not the target audience; I'm an adult, and this book was chosen for our monthly read, but I still enjoyed it.  My only complaint is that I grew tired of the drama about Katniss and Peeta.  Katniss is so smart, but she couldn't figure out that Peeta really loves her?  She continues to believe it's all a ruse to play the audience during the games?  This didn't really work for me, but I understand that the book is targeted at a young adult audience, and this is all part of the story unfolding. I'm going to watch the film, and I'm also going to read the other two books in the series--have to find out how it all ends!
Synopsis:  In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.  Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before--and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that will weigh survival against humanity and life against love.  Verdict:  In this book, Ms. Collins built a fantastical and believable world where the United States is no more and instead the country is now called Panem which is run from "The Capital" and divided into 12 districts. The story progresses quickly and fluently with well defined characters who have lame names.  The author's style is great. Ms. Collins' prose is efficient in a no-nonsense style filled with humor which causes the book to become addictive. Like any good story, you are immersed in the universe built around you, yet you know it is not real but you can't stop reading.  WARNING:  The premise for this trilogy is pretty disturbing. It's kids killing kids in a `fight to the death' tournament. But as disturbing as it sounds, the author did a good job of not overwhelming the reader with blood, guts, and gore. The shock value is that this, the actual Hunger Games itself, is considered to be a form of `entertainment' for the people in the Capitol.
I am not much of a reader, but my wife told me about the book. As soon as picked it up, I could not put it down. I finished it within 3 days, which is unheard of for me. The second book in the series I read just as fast. Great easy read, fantastic story. The flow of the book is fast paced and fun.
I have absolutely enjoyed this book to the fullest. Sure, it's for young adults (and I am in my 30's) but if you want to read a great page-turner, then this is the book for you. You should not go into reading this expecting to have your socks knocked off with the literary genius of the book, however if you are someone who is looking for a cool, addictive read, then the Hunger Games is just the book for you!
I`ve read this book so fast I had to re~read it all over again which I had no problem with since it was sooooo good!!!  Trust me, you won`t just want to read it once, you will want to read it a lot of times.  This book is even good for adults too {my mom read it and loved it too} so there`s no excuse to not read this book.  It`s a must read.
I do not normally post reviews on things but this book was amazing.  It is one of those books that grab you from page one and does not let go until the end of book three.  I have read all three books and am going back and rereading them.  I have recommended this book to all my family and friends and say it is a must read.
Be ready to put your life on hold until you read all 3 books! I couldn't put them down. I had my mortgage bank and my insurance company calling me about my over due bills - I neglected everything (but my children) until I read these books! Amazing, riveting and draining all at once, I even worried about the characters.
The Hunger Games lives up to the hype, heart and soul. It's filled with layered characters, crafty plot twits and unexpected alliances that kept me guessing, turning pages and reading as fast as I could. Outstanding! Couldn't put it down.  I look forward to burning the midnight oil with Catching Fire...
a great tale in which katniss must fight her way to victory to win the hunger games... a televised event for the entertainment of the capitol,a ruthless gov ernment controlling a region once known as norht america. katniss must do terri le things in these games to win back her freedom. an amzing story.
Part one of the trilogy is actually the best book in the trilogy. AN excellent read with obvious statements about our current society's  emphasis on image &amp; entertainment.  It's a shame about part three, Mockingjay, which I gave up on.  However this book is good as a stand alone
I read this book prior to seeing the movie and I was extremely surprised how good it was.  I'm 50+ and everything I was told and heard was that it was a book for a much younger generation - but I could not stop reading it.  It captivated my imagination.  Can't wait to read the next book.
I would have enjoyed this book much better had it been a little more realistic. But I know it's more of a YA novel so I guess I can forgive that. It was a great parody of reality TV. Most of it was fun to read. However, I didn't appreciate the zombie werewolves. Pretty corny and ridiculous. To me the main weakness of the book was that I never felt a real connection to any of the characters. It felt like a compilation of of different science fiction elements and it ended up not feeling as real as it could and should have.
I've read very little fiction in my adult life.  I was standing in the middle of a Super WalMart a few nights ago when this book caught my eye.  Maybe it was the black cover.  I read the synopsis and a few paragraphs and had the feeling I had picked it up before.  I didn't buy it then but couldn't stop thinking about it the next day.  From the reviews I've read, not being able to get the book out of one's head is a common occurrence.    I basically ran full-speed back to WalMart that night to read a couple more paragraphs.  I opened at random to the astounding passage in which Katniss is standing on the disc, waiting for the gong to sound and the game to begin. By the time her orange backpack had deflected the knife and she was running toward the forest, I was hooked.    I stayed up all night to read it.  I took a few small breaks only to massage my neck and grab a Coke. I decided about a quarter of the way through that it was by far the most disturbing book I'd ever read.  The weirdest.  The most sickeningly nightmarish....("What kind of mind...?").  I couldn't get enough of it.    I have two big problems with it though. I don't think anyone in reality would buy the love story that Katniss's sponsors were trying to push. When people are fighting against each other for survival, they don't fall in love. Second, I found it totally incredulous that Thresh would spare Katniss's life, especially so late in the game. I know he and Rue were from the same district, but it just seemed totally unbelievable and something of a *deus ex machina* to keep Katniss alive until the end.    I'm a little embarrassed that I didn't realize until reading reviews online that *The Hunger Games* is considered a "children's" book.  What child would read this though? The writing style and content seem about as adult as can be. I found the book in the adult section, so apparently I'm not the only one with this view.
Its way better than the movie. I like how well written this book is and that it mainly focuses on Katness. But I don't like this perspective for the future. The capitol is full of idiots who enjoy watching gory deaths. I didn't absolutely hate this book, but I definitely disliked it.
Decent book.  Not nearly as good as the reviews in general, but decent.  Basically, this is the Running Man with some of The Long Walk mixed in.  Add a little of the TV show Survivor and voila!  Entertaining, but CLEARLY stripped down to appeal to a younger audience.
I've read the negative reviews of those who were appalled by the violence of teenagers, by teenagers.  Well, I believe the author recognizes that in a society such as this, a society that has devolved into an existence rather than life, people don't get to hold on to youth for very long.  Life has become so cheap that when it ends earlier than it should, the death is a release, painful to those left behind, but an end to misery for the person who dies.  I believe she does a fine job of showing that not all the adversaries are capable, at least initially, of thinking in terms of killing.  They have to grow to it out of survival instinct.  And if some wish to believe that all these teenagers would be peaceable people if left to their own devices, then I wouldn't wish to disabuse them of their innocence.  However, I believe that most of us realize that there are psychopaths born, and psychopaths created, in just this sort of environment every day, and those people do not require anything like organized "games" to perpetrate violence.  The "careers" would fit that profile.  As for the others, well survival instinct would be all that is necessary.  Prim would never have been able to rise to it, but her character is representative of that special portion of society, all societies, that help us hold on to our best humanity.  I didn't at first enjoy the first person telling of the story, but I grew to appreciate it.  Some negative reviews disliked Katniss, but I say to them, if you have to become the adult at 11 and the survival of your entire family falls to you, there is very little time to develop a sweet, girlish, dreamy personality.  If she seems cold, calculating and unfeeling, well, there again, how can you survive if you are worried about the feelings of every person you meet?  If you want to heal every animal you shoot for food (Prim) then hunting will be out as a means to feeding your family.  If you are worried about upsetting someone, you might not be able to bargain successfully for things your family needs.  I found Katniss to be a deeply loving person, for those she allows in.  I wonder, in some of those reviews, if it is more the fact that she is a female survivor that has some reviewers so down on her character.  Perhaps we would accept a male making the calculations and being cold and aloof, to be more acceptable to our idea of what makes a good adversary.  Perhaps had it been Peeta who was the savior and Katniss who was relying heavily on him, some of those reviews would have been more positive.  Anyway, I am waiting with great anticipation for the final segment of Mockingjay to be released, at which time I will buy the set, but until that time I am filling in the time by rereading the Hunger Games trilogy, and once again, enjoying it completely.
I wasn't sure if I was going to like this book. I was hesitant to read it as I normally try to avoid over-hyped books. Eventually my curiosity won out and I decided to read the trilogy. I'm only done with the first book so far, but I'm really glad I read it.  Everyone knows the premise by now, no need for me to rehash a summary.  I really liked Katniss. She grew up in a very rough situation. She spent her whole life so far struggling to survive and to keep her family alive as well. She is very resourceful. She made the ultimate act of love in volunteering to take her younger sister's place in the games, but she didn't expect to survive. She harbors great disgust for the capital and what they are doing to the people of the districts. And is revolted by the people that see 24 kids fighting to the death as entertainment.  I know this is a dystopian world so a person really has to separate that world from our reality while reading. But it was really hard to understand how the people of the capital could be so distanced from feeling anything for the people of the districts. If it weren't for the districts, the people of the capital couldn't survive. The most disturbing part to me was the people that were helping prep Katniss and Peeta for the games. I was dumbfounded at the lessons and coaching for the interview. Does it really matter considering all but one are going to be dead shortly anyway?  The addition of Rue to the story, who reminded Katniss of her little sister, was very emotional. Katniss liked her but yet deep down knew that they both weren't going to survive, and yet she helped Rue as much as she could.  The biggest struggle I had with the story was wondering why the districts didn't revolt again. In reality, they hold all the power. If they all stopped providing the coal, food, etc to the capital, the people of the capital couldn't survive. Yes, the capital may lash out at them, but they can't really kill all of the people in the districts because they needed them to continue being their slaves. I'm sure that's why the capital kept the districts segregated, as long as they couldn't communicate with each other, they couldn't coordinate a revolution.  The twist at the end with the "creatures" was a bit over the top. It just added to the feeling of the gamemakers and capital residents having a very warped reality. Their reality is so far from the reality we know and the districts know that it makes them seem down right crazy.  All in all I am very glad I read this book. I will be reading the rest of the trilogy as well. After that I may even see the movies. This book really stuck with me. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. That is a sign of a very good story.
Firstly, I hate giving anything five stars. If something is incredible I usually give four. Five means flawless and this book was just good.  Originally, I was determined not to read this book. Of course I kept hearing about it and I kept thinking, a book about children killing each other? That sounds horrific and depressing, which it is. At times it is absolutely horrifying, more so than any horror movie. At other times it is so beautiful and heartbreaking it brought me to tears. There were times when reading this I wanted to run home, hold my family and tell them I love them, and there were times I wanted to vomit in disgust. I think at the center of this book is reflection. What it means to live, to have compassion, what you would be willing to do to survive or for others, what others would be willing to do for power. I felt in so many ways the the author was reflecting our society back to us.  This story takes place in Panem, in what is today North America. In Panem there are twelve districts and one all controlling capital. While people of the districts starve, the people of the capital eat for pleasure, dress to excess, and most importantly watch the districts children fight to the death for entertainment. This is punishment for rising up against the capital long before any of the children were born. In so many ways I thought are we the capital? The way that wealth in America today obsess with fashion, with celebrity, with trival non-sense so far removed from the real issues of the world. The starving, the poor, the wars. Don't people today find entertainment in violence? In what ways are today's governments like the capital of the hunger games world? What would we do if we were in this situation? Kill others to survive even if they are also pawns in the government's game of keeping it's citizens down? Rise up against the capital even if it means death for everyone we love? Everything about love, honor, family, loyalty, honesty is questioned in this book. Really a fantastic read that is both entertaining and enlightening about humanity.
This is the perfect sappy love adventure for anyone!!! The best part is knowing she actually has feelings for peeta. If anything read this book before seeing the movie because the movie will make much more sense after reading the book  I LOVE THIS BOOK! IT IS ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY ESSENTIAL TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!! I could not put this book down at all. I started this the day catching fire came out and I loved it.  Here is my list on what: made this book amazing:  1. Not much violence cause you would think a lot of bloody scary detail. not at all.  2. Lots of detail. It painted a clear picture in my mind  3. Original. You would think oh just another long violent boring book. But it isn't . It shows her emotions  Spoilers review   The hunger games is a BOOK about panem a country that was once know as north America where the districts fought against the capitol and as punishment for it each district shall offer one male and female who will fight to the death in the arena and the winner will be bathed in riches.    Katniss Everdeen is a poor girl who lives in district twelve. Pete malark is a boy has always had enough to it and likes katniss. Katniss loves her sister so much she volunteered for her at t he reaping so katniss and peers are the two star crossed lovers from district twelve who go th through so much together to stay alive.    When the time comes theory do everything they can to keep each others alive during the games meanwhile the capitol loves watching kids fight to the death. There can only be one winner in the end though so they show up the capitol saying there doesn't have to be a winner.    I recommend this book to anyone then now I have to read the other two!!!!!-!
The Hunger Games, is a dystopian novel that was written by Suzanne Collins. The novel portrays a future in North America where once a child turns 12 years old, their name is put into a drawing between the girls and the boys. A teenage girl and a teenage boy from each of the 12 districts compete till the death, until one person is left standing. The mayor of district 12 named Effie Trinket draws out a name from the girls and the boys. The name she had drawn from the girls was Prim Everdeen. Once everyone had heard the name of the girls, Prims sister Katniss Everdeen, had volunteered as tribute to take her sisters spot in the 74th Hunger Games. Then, Effie Trinket had drawn a name for the boys, and the name was Peeta Mellark.    Once every district had a teenage boy and a teenage girl tribute, they were all sent to go train before the battle. Everyone had practiced with different types of weapons, such as knives, bow and arrows, and etc. Peeta Mellark even practiced real live painting on skin, so that he could blend with different surroundings, during the games. Weeks after practicing, everyone was ready to go to the Hunger Games. As they counted down the seconds before starting, you could tell that everyone was very nervous. Then, before you knew it, it was time; everyone had rushed to go get a survivor bag. Many of people were already getting killed in an instant. As the games went on all you could hear was a canon or gun being fired, every time you heard that noise that means someone had died, and it was all being televised live. As Katniss stayed in a tree all night, she had noticed that the guy that was supposed to be on her team had traded her, and that was Peeta. A guy named Cato from district 2 had people help looking for Katniss, so that they could kill her. Day by day more and more people were dying. Sooner or later Katniss had found some plants and mud that looked like they had been used for something. So, Katniss kept following the trails and found Peeta in the mud, being artistic. Peeta had used the mud and the plants so that he could blend in with the surroundings. The canon had fired again, there were only 3 people left but only one could win. Those 3 people were Katniss, Peeta, and Cato, who was going to win?  Find out who is going to win, when you read the book The Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen is a sixteen year old woman, who volunteered to take her sisters spot in the Hunger Games, and she is just hoping that she can return back to her family. Peeta Mellark is a sixteen year old bakers son, who is very compassionate and was entered into the Hunger Games also as a tribute.    The theme of this book is to stand up for what you believe in, even if you have to take risks, because if Katniss didnt take her sisters spot in the Hunger Games, then the capital wouldve turned the death of children into entertainment. Katniss Everdeen is the protagonist in this story because she has to fight to the death and return to her family. The consequences for the protagonist, is that she faces that Peeta is going against her. Some problems when reading this book, is that I had to keep reading some chapters over again to understand them. I recommend this book, because you will just want to keep reading the book without stopping because you will want to know what happens next. Just stand up for what you believe in, even if you have to take risks.
I was introduced to The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, a few years ago by my friend before it  became a pop hit around the country. With the new release of Catching Fire in movie theaters, I have decided to come back and reread the book. Coming back to the world have Panem for a second time around still held up fairly well to my expectations. It's no wonder that The Hunger Games has become a huge hit .  Natural disasters and human war has brought humanity into a precarious life. People live in what is now North America, albeit a different version, in the country of Panem. Within this country lies twelve districts, each one specializing in certain products and where the people live poverty-stricken lives in order to support the jewel of the nation, the Captiol. Years before, there were thirteen districts. After a failed rebellion, the thirteenth was destroyed and the rest were burdened with what is known as The Hunger Games, an event that pits two children, one male and one female, in a fight to the death.  The Hunger Games is the story of Katniss, a sixteen-year old girl who supports her family on her own through illegal hunting since her father died in a mine accident. For the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss takes the place of her sister, Prim, as tribute for District Twelve and finds herself in a fight for her life and the life of her fellow tribute, Peter Mellark.  Katniss definitely grows and changes throughout her experience in the Hunger Games. At the beginning, she is this young girl, focused on trying to keep those she loves alive. As time goes on, she begins to get a first look into the lives of those outside her district and begins to form her own opinions about society and life. I sometimes found it a bit tedious to listen to her ramble on in her head at some points, but I just passed it by. The rest of the characters have their own personalities, but most just seem to be there to pass along the story to and help set up events for Katniss.  It's funny how such a brutal event, where kids are supposed to kill each other for entertainment, gives way to some sort of real/fake love story. The Hunger Games are described as gruesome bloodbaths, with tributes killing and maiming others in horrible ways. Yet, Collins almost downplays this key characteristic in order to focus on the romance that constantly switches between a fake show and true emotions. There were some very violent moments, but for the most part, the romance plays the largest role. I found that the constant switching became a bit annoying, as if Collins wanted to make sure the reader absolutely understood the problem.  Within this story of romance and perseverance, Collins takes a stab at the growing split between the very rich and the very poor. She paints the rich, the people who live in the Capitol, as terrible people who find entertainment in watching children and teenagers fight and kill each other in cold blood. They feast upon delicacies and live in posh apartments while those who live in the districts live meager lives, barley scraping by every day. She builds the entire world upon the premise of the gap of wealth and wants to show that it will only get worse if it is allowed to linger around.  I really enjoyed The Hunger Games both on my first read and in following ones. For some, it's a story of an individual trying to overcome all odds. For others, it's a romantic drama between two young people. The Hunger Games can take on different meanings, which is one of the reasons why it is such a good book and why it is one of the most popular series today.
Is This a Good Book for Kids?  As a media professor and author of young adult sci-fi, I have spent more than a few years studying research on entertainment and psychology.  Just before Catching Fire was released in theaters, I was asked this question by a television news program.  Most of the research that exists on the impact of media violence on children concerns television and video games.  However, a common theme in all the research was that exposure to violence with no social justice creates feelings of helplessness and inevitability.  This is particularly significant when looking at the influence of peer groups.  Peer group establish norms for behavior.  Younger people are more susceptible to following the norms established by their peer group, even when that behavior is destructive.  We see bullying as a prevalent example.  Kids who have developed a strong a sense of social justicethe belief that their actions matter to society, are able to identify and withstand the negative tendencies of their peer group.  They may deal with it differently.  One individual may loudly challenge the behavior, while another may find more subtle means to counteract the groups destructive behavior.  So when we put the violence of The Hunger Games into the context of the entire story, the question becomes, What values does the book impart?  Particularly, the narrator, Katniss?  She is a teen from a poor community, oppressed by those in power.  She sacrifices herself for a greater cause, in this case initially to save her younger sister from certain death.  Finally she decided she would rather die than accept the ruling-classs inhumane system of social control.  When she is forced to fight, she only defends herself and risks her life to defend others who are weaker or disadvantaged.  By standing up to unjust authorities, she changes the world for the better. These are values we hope to find in people of all ages.  The books message of resistance to oppression seems to me to be an antidote to oppression felt by both kids and adults.  To find much of the research concerning children and media entertainment, do a search on Joanne Cantor (University of Wisconsin) and Patti Valkenburg (University of Amsterdam), leading scientists in this field.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is an amazing book! I couldn't put it down! The book takes place in the future and shows how the central government is run. There are no cities but everything is divided into "Districts." Once a year each district has to draw name (teen male and female) from a glass to pick who will fight in the annual Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a certain setting that the government chooses and where the teens will fight to the death. Only one person wins. Whoever isn't killed and is the last standing wins. Although when the main character Katniss Everdeen volunteers things change drastically! The whole time I could not put the book down! Great read.  Even though the book is in the future and is realistic fiction it makes you wonder what our government might be like. The idea of having our government send teens to fight to the death is not only eye opening but very interesting to see take place in a book. The author uses vivid description you almost want to laugh, cry, and smile just like the characters! You almost feel like you are in the book. Logically and emotionally the book appealed to me right from the dirt paragraph! I instantly made a connection with the book that I had never with any other book.  The amount of description that was used in the book was amazing. The book was very suspenseful  considering the fact teens were forced to kill each other. You not only have the action- adventure element you have the romance between the main characters and the intense situations each character must face. There wasn't  a second where I ever doubted choosing to read the book. I never wanted it to be over! Overall I highly recommend this book and hope anyone who decides to read it enjoys the book as much as I did.
Book one in the Hunger Games Trilogy, by bestselling young adult author Suzanne Collins, introduces Katniss Everdeen, who, although only 16, has survived and taken care of her mother and beloved sister, Prim - for the five years since her father was blown up in a mine - by hunting illegally with her best friend Gale.  In this fantasy thriller, set in the country of Panem, which is located where North America had been before it was destroyed, Katniss lives in District 12, where Appalachia once was, where coal is mined, and where most of the residents are among the poorest of the entire country.  There were once 13 districts, but District 13 staged a revolt against the Capital and was destroyed.  To remind the residents of the power of the Capital and the danger of revolting against them, they hold annually what is known as "The Hunger Games," where two children between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district, a girl and a boy, are sent as tributes to fight to the death until one victor is named.  The Capital treats it as a holiday, shows the cruel "games" on television, and generally makes a celebration of showing that they can take the resident's precious children and nothing can be done about it.  Everyone is required to be in the square at 2:00 on the day of what is called "the reaping," where the names of the tributes are drawn.  Unfortunately, Katniss' little sister, 12 year old Prim's, name is drawn, so Katniss volunteers to be the tribute rather than to let her little sister go to her death.  The other tribute will be Peeta Mellark, the baker's son.  After being allowed to say goodbye to family and friends, the tributes are transported by train to The Capital, where they are wined and dined (more rich and delicious food than Katniss has ever seen in her life), as well as presented to the country after being groomed by stylists.  Katniss and Peeta have great stylists and make a debut with costumes that appear to be on fire; they draw the attention of the country, but aren't favored to win since there are "career tributes" who have been training all of their lives to compete.  Afterwards, they go to training with the tributes from the other districts where they learn survival skills.  Once the games start, it is a fight to the death for the kids; the suspense is unnerving, and it is very difficult to put the book down until the surprise ending is revealed.  Both Katniss and Peeta know that there can be only one victor, and even though they are from the same district, they don't want to become friends since one of them may have to kill the other if one of the other tributes doesn't do it first.  It's no wonder that this book was made into a movie after hitting the bestseller lists; although it was written for young adults, The Hunger Games mesmerized both young adults and adults alike.  Anyone who hasn't read the book has cheated himself out of a great reading experience.  The subject matter of the book is difficult, and it's not easy to read about likeable characters who are starving, and in peril trying to stay alive.  However, Collins handles it well, with innuendo of violence rather than blatant graphic violence throughout the novel.  The underlying issues of corrupt government power, cruelty, greed, true friendship, importance of family ties, and loyalty are evident in this novel, and when finished it is one that is not easily forgotten.  Obviously the subject matter is not for young children, and some of the incidents during the games could cause a few nightmares.  However, The Hunger Games and the two subsequent books are absolute must-reads.  This book was purchased with personal funds and no promotion of the book was solicited by the author or publisher.
1) Plot (5 stars) - In a future where children are reaped to fight to the death in the equivalent of a reality TV show, one contestant refuses to play by the rules, an act of rebellion that could start a revolution.  Collins' plot is fast-moving and suspenseful, resulting in a one of those "can't put down" books.  2) Characters (4 stars) - Katniss is the reluctant hero, a tough, brave, but emotionally-closed teenager.  She has much of the angst of a modern adolescent, only she is living in much more trying times.  Two boys complete the love triangle.  Gale, the rough and angry Option A, and Peeta, the kind and sensitive Option B.  All three were drawn well and enjoyable.  3) Theme (4 stars) - There's obviously a statement in here about a totalitarian government stealing freedoms from the masses.  But we've heard that story before, so thankfully there was also something new.  What I found fresh was the commentary on the modern spectator society--on how when we view other people's triumphs and sufferings through a screen they become entertainment to be consumed, and how this informational closeness but human distance makes us self-centered and numb.  And there's also a comment on the other side--on the object of the spectators--the Facebook, Twitter, and Blog generation who publically narrate their lives and spend their time playing to invisible eyes.  This theme is relatively new in the human experience (at least at this magnitude), and so it was neat to see it already explored in a work of fiction.  4) Voice (4 stars) - The story is told from Katniss' clipped, direct POV.  Though I wouldn't describe the prose as poetic, it was very readable and creates a definite mood to the tale.  5) Setting (4 stars) - Collins' skillfully paints a future that is both different and recognizable.  I could image the picture she paints.  6) Overall (4 stars) - A fast-moving dystopian tale with a fresh moral for our Facebook generation.  Though the target audience is young adults, I felt the teenage angst was done with sophistication, and the somewhat clichéd juvenile rivalries were not too distracting.  I'd recommend it.
Katniss volunteers for the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death, in place of her little sister.a boy and a girl are chosen, and guess who's the boy? Peeta Mellark, the boy who once saved her life.  It only gets more complicated when he proclaims to all of Panem that he loves her--and then there's Gale, the boy she left behind in District 12.  It's safe to say her life is pretty complicated.  WOOSH! Did you hear that! that was the sound of my mind being blown away. Let's just say this book set the bar for awesomeness. I got this for Easter and I couldn't help myself--Even though I wasn't supposed to read it yet, I took a little 'peek' that ended up lasting for 12 pages.  Hunger Games hooked me from the start. In fact, I would give this book six stars if it was possible!  The things I liked--no, LOVED about this book were:  1.) the action. I've never read a book that had so much action and yet wasn't some cheesy crap that reminded me of a bad 'guy flick'. It was well written and kept me wanting to read more.  2.) The romance; one of my friends put it like this; ' I wish I had someone like that.' So, all my guy friends who read this were really into the action scenes, and all my girl friends were crying over loving kisses in a cave. (Read and it'll make sense.)  3.) the whole book. There was really nothing bad to say about it. Even though there was a  certain scene where I was sobbing and mentally yelling "WHY!", I actually DID understand why Suzanne Collins had to put it in there. It was for the best.  And she succeeded in making this particular scene even more beautiful in the end, which made me need to get even MORE kleenex. So I really can't complain.  4.) The book makes you think. It's not simply a mindless entertainment story.  So. I am done with my rant on how this book was the equivalent of a hot fudge cookie sundae with a cherry on top. Or, an all-expense paid trip to the Caribbean.  Or becoming best friends with the superstar you idolize.  Or--well, you get my point.  Now, you must go out to the library, or the bookstore, or a friend who owns it, or wherever you get your books, and READ IT. No matter if you're a guy or a girl, or someone who hates reading.  You'll LOVE the Hunger Games. I promise!
Firstly I'm probably the only person to never read The Hunger Games as soon as I heard it was amazing. I took my time getting to this book and I should have listened to everyone else and raced to it, but I'm stubborn! Pushing that aside the Hunger Games is uniquely constructed, and has an extraordinarily built world that's vividly detailed. The characters are remarkable, each with a surprising amount of depth, and easy-to-like or easy-to-hate personalities. From the beginning you'll have your mind made up on whose good and whose bad--that will change. The heroine Katniss Everdeen is flawed yet has a lot of strength and courage. Right off the bat I really admired her for stepping up to protect her little sister Prim from the Games by taking her place. Her bravery is impressive but aside from that she's also a wood's warrior; she can climb trees, has deadly accuracy with a bow, and can hunt like nobody's business. Then there's Peeta - the bread making boy from her district whose also chosen for the arena. He's the epitome of all that is good, kind-hearted, self-sacrificing, and loyal to no end. His stability and confidence is unbelievably charming. His relationship with Katniss is complicated and beautiful--you'll be rooting for them throughout the entire story!  I loved almost everything about The Hunger Games the only disappointment I had was that we rarely got to see much of Peeta as he and Katniss are often separated. Gale whom is Katniss' bestfriend from the district is mentioned frequently but we never really get to know him except through what we hear about him. Excluding those facts I enjoyed the camaraderie between the formed alliances, but was seriously devastated at the hopelessness of the situations all the characters find themselves in. Haymitch--Katniss and Peeta's mentor--is perhaps underrated but astronomically important in trying to help them succeed and stay alive. I feel that more credit is due to him as a past survivor of the Hunger Games, I loved that even though he's strange and irreparably damaged he gives them the tools necessary to have a good chance at beating the odds. He has such a darkly humorous outlook and it was refreshing of his character not to sugarcoat the very likelihood of death. I don't think many YA authors take such matters seriously enough and portrays important issues appropriately, but Suzanne Collins gets it and does it right. Those expecting romance will be satisfied and yet still want more. The Hunger Games is conceptually clever and extremely gripping. I was near tears during some of the scenes as they struck a chord inside that appeals to everyone's humanity. The world built and weaved into words is dark, seemingly despaired, and unjust but riveting nevertheless. The realness of it will chill your blood because the situations are pretty believable. Children and teens fight for their survival and are pitted against each other for the entertainment of the Capitol and the last one standing wins. It's beyond twisted, crosses many moral lines, but you won't be able to stop reading once you start. I'd strongly recommend for teens over the age of 14 due to violence, and human cruelty.  Located in the ruins of North America lies 12 districts in a nation called Panem with a government-like society dead center named, The Capitol. You have to follow each and every rule because if you don't punishment is swift and deadly. Every year The Capitol holds and celebrates the biggest event--the Hunger Games. Children and teens are randomly selected and forced to participate in a life or death battle arena where only one can emerge as the victor. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen isn't looking forward to the reaping process this year particularly since she's got numerous chances of being selected. She's both horrified and shocked when her younger, and only sister Prim is chosen as the contender. She does the only thing that can save her--she offers to take her place. With this almost guaranteed death sentence Katniss must make some of the most difficult decisions that goes against her morals to make it out alive--and may the odds be ever in her favor--or not.  The Hunger Games is wildly engaging and shockingly amusing. It's easy to lose track of time, minutes will turn into hours so beware of the addicting nature of this novel. It's a blend of science fiction, dystopia, with realistic conditions and futuristic-like advancements. If ever there was a trilogy worth reading it would be this one. It has a universal appeal, it can most definitely be enjoyed by both teens and adults. The Hunger Games is suspenseful, emotional, and a must-read. Collins has written a powerful story with authentic characters, and creates an unbelievably astonishing, and gritty world.
The Hunger Games Review?  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins...Wait, I know what you are already thinking...Do I really need to read another review of The Hunger Games? Well, lets talk about what a review really does. A review allows the reader to digest...so to speak...their reading experience. It allows said reader to mull over the key virtues or defects the reader found in the book he or she has just finished.  A review is a personal comment on the reader's personal reading experience. So in essence, by penning a review the reader is allowed to connect with the reading community at large, which doesn't often happen; since reading is usually a solitary activity. So, yes, I do want to offer my personal take on the colossally popular YA novel.  The Hunger Games has been sitting in my To Be Read (TBR) pile by my bed, since it first came out. What I'm saying is, I didn't just jump on the bandwagon, because it became this giant hit in 2011/2012. I haven't even seen the movie. Honestly, the dystopian genre has always been a favorite of mine. Science fiction is what I called it back in the day, but now this offshoot of science fiction has emerged with its own characteristics. It is really amazing to watch a whole new genre come to life from the ashes-so to speak-of science fiction. I guess it is important to identify what classifies a book as dystopian. Robinson Wells defines dystopia on his blog as, "Utopia with a fatal flaw. Think of all the classic dystopias--1984, Brave New World, The Giver, etc.. These novels all show worlds that attempted to create a perfect society, but that 'perfection' was attained at a horrible cost." (I'll add Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery to this list of past dystopian classics) I like this definition, so lets go with it; since there are dystopianites all over the world debating the "real definition" of this genre as I press the keys to click out this review.  Now for the review...I read the The Hunger Games back in May/June 2012, it jumped to the top of my TBR pile when I was asked to write the English Department's request to add this novel to our seventh grade approved list of "teaching novels."  You can't very well write such a document unless you have read the book, but I seem to continue to digress.  I read the book and wrote up the request, but I did not write my review.  Before I felt comfortable penning my commentary, I needed some mulling over time.  I now have had several weeks to carefully consider this novel, and here are my thoughts...The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is one of the best dystopian novels, I have read to date.  It has so much to offer.  With that said, I will add that I am going to present my review in a most non-traditional manner.  First, I am going to assume that anyone who is reading this review already knows the basic premise of the book, in other words, I'm skipping the summary part of the review.  Instead, I am going to focus on the themes the novel has to offer in the hopes that YOU, the reader of this review, will make some connections and develop new original thoughts based on the various and sundry themes floating amongst the 374 pages of this dystopian YA novel-and there are many.  Here is what I came up with...  Friendship  Friendship is seen in many forms throughout the novel:  Katniss and Gale  Katniss and Peeta  Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch  Katniss and Cinna  Throughout all of these relationships, friendship is revealed to be a crucial factor in the triumph of Katniss.  Family and Sacrifice  Loyalty and protection of family - Katniss makes the ultimate sacrifice to save her sister by volunteering as a tribute in the games. This is an important theme for young people, as the life of social media, and fragile connections between friends and family is now the norm. Through the lens of the novel, teens will be forced to imagine if they would be brave or valiant enough to stand up and protect family members, and thereby, decide how much personal relationships mean to them. Would they give up their Gameboys, their Internet or Facebook? What about their cell phones? Young people today are so connected with their technology, they often don't think about what is at stake.  Survival  Survival/Importance of Nature - There are many interesting techniques dealing with surviving in nature on one's own found throughout the novel. Katniss shows the importance of knowing how to stay alive with no technology, or help of any kind. This is important for young adults today because of society's heavy reliance on technology. Through the protagonist, Katniss, teens are forced to imagine life with no technology. Questions such as-How might a modern day teenager communicate, eat, or provide for their families if they lived in the world of The Hunger Games?- can be addressed by the reader of this dystopian novel.  Freedom and Oppression  Freedom of Speech - The Avox character in The Hunger Games is a distinct representation in our "real world" of the dangers of losing our Constitutional rights as citizens. These servant characters have had their tongues removed for slanderous remarks, or simply questions pointed to the capital of Panem. The novel allows teens to examine the importance of the Freedom of Speech, and think about what we, as a society, should be doing to protect this right.  Materialism  Loss of Identity through Fashion - The character of Effie Trinket is a colorful, and fashion driven lady who is "always up on the latest fashion". She does a wonderful job of showing the reader how far fashion trends can go. She is the bridge to discussion of social classes and the gap between rich and poor. The wider this gap becomes, the more apparent it is to outsiders to be able to identify the rich from the poor. The fashions become a symbol of social status in the world, and something that the rich are unaware they are marketing. A great eye opener for fashion driven teenagers.  Class Structure  Defining the "haves" and the "have-nots" - Through the novel, teens are forced to compare and contrast the population of the capitol with the population of the districts. Young adults are forced to use critical thinking skills to decide what is important: the relationships of family and friends as shown in the districts, or material goods as in the capitol. Also, the novel allows teenagers to examine the unfair nature of government, as it is portrayed in the novel, as all products are filtered through the walls of the capital, and thereby the reader is allowed to examine what is wrong with the capital's system of government.  Media  Dangers of the Media - In The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins makes a clear issue of the dangers of reality television, something that our whole society is exposed to on a daily basis. The concept that the reader should be taking away from the novel, is that with little provocation, our society is very quick to forget about the people (tributes) involved in many "media challenges". As viewers, we disregard the human aspect of television, and focus on entertainment alone. Panem's capitol is representing the future of our culture if reality television keeps going in the direction it is aimed. The novel forces teenagers to make connections by relating the media circus of The Hunger Games to shows like Jersey Shore and Hoarders. Very savvy teenagers will readily see the dangers of using people's problems as entertainment. Mature teenagers will also ask questions, such as, do we see these people as people or characters? In asking these types of questions teenagers will become aware that media has a way of making us forget just who is on the other side of the camera.  Identity  Loss of Identity through Media - Peeta's struggle to be more "than a pawn in the games", is a large theme in the novel. His fight to keep his loyalties with Katniss though the games is honorable and is a good example of overcoming peer pressure. The teens will observe the methods that Katniss and Peeta use to overcame the game's influence to become killers, and instead hold fast to their morals, and only do what is necessary to survive. In contrast to other characters, Katniss and Peeta did not abide by the capitol's wish to "put on a good show" for the viewers of the games. They often use the influence of the media in their favor, as well, in helpful and peaceful ways, as opposed to the violence used by the other characters in the novel.  Symbolism  The mockingjay pin - The mockingjay pin worn by Katniss in the novel, symbolizes the revolution of the districts. Using the "historical context" of the pin, which is a jab against the capital (mockingjays were created to spy on the people of the districts, but the districts discovered the birds and used them as a way to feed the capitol false information), becomes something that represents not only the revolution, but hope, freedom, and the ability to change.  Historical Context  The Hunger Games Arena - The Arena that the tributes fight in is very much influenced by the Roman Era Arena. The whole idea of people having to fight to the death as entertainment for the "upper class" is parallel to Roman times gladiatorial competitions held in coliseums all over the Roman Empire. This might potentially opens up a teens interest in a historical time period. It can also allow teens to identify elements of the novel that are inspired by history.  Whooh!  I have come to the end of my list of themes. I know this is not what you might have been expecting since this is labeled as a review, but do note the question mark in the heading of my review. The Hunger Games (Book 1)  [...]
** spoiler alert ** First off...SPOILERS are in this review. If you have not read the book, back out of this review now.  The setting is in the far distant future, but it's mind-blowing to even think that humankind can become so callous and malevolent as to send twenty four children between the ages of twelve and seventeen to their deaths yearly. What has happened to make us this way?  We don't really know. What we do know is that a large number of people--an entire District--were killed by the government, the Capitol, as an example of what could happen if you were to ever step out of line again. It's told to us that there were once thirteen of these districts, each with a different industry focused to provide goods for the Capitol. Supposedly, you can still see District 13 smoldering from the damage done. At least this is what our character and those of her kind have been led to believe. It's been more than 70 years since any of it happened so the details are sketchy at best.  In the beginning, I felt sorry for Gale. The very hunky, every girl in District 12 seems to want him, boy who is Katniss' best friend. We learn very little of him, actually, we learn very little of any of them, but you can tell from their short interaction that he has developed feelings for her. She, of course, is oblivious. She seems to suffer from this affliction throughout the book in regard to any male affection. I digress.  We learn quite a bit more--by comparison--about her "relationship" with Peeta. He's the quiet boy with the crush from a distance, who finally gets his chance to tell her how he feels, and he does it openly on a large stage. A grand gesture for sure, but of course Katniss is oblivious to this. Though at the direction of her sponsors, she winds up playing to the cameras during their time in the Arena and is rewarded for this.  You realize right away that she is oblivious to Peeta's actual feelings and you feel sorry for the guy. Can anyone honestly say that if in Katniss' situation they wouldn't have suspected the same?  There are ever so slight twists to the story. You truly learn very little about anyone but Katniss--it's first person point of view, so she'd be the one we unearth the most about.  There is an amount of predictability to the storyline, but it's original in plot. If you don't pay attention to the tidbits of information given to you by Katniss throughout the book, you will miss the character development. There were only a few small grammatical errors, but once I hit page 57, I didn't want to put the book down for too long.
So when everyone was getting all excited for the release of `The Hunger Games' film, I was sitting there thinking `OH GOD NO!'. From what I heard it was going to be the `New Twilight', and quite frankly, I couldn't think of anything worse. Whilst the Twilight books were quite good, the films were the worst things I had ever seen in my life, and I couldn't bare to think of another seemingly good book go down the drain.  But anyway, a friend bullied me into it, and I downloaded Hunger Games on my kindle.  It was devoured in the space of 24 hours and then Catching Fire and Mockingjay were immediately downloaded and yet again devoured in the space of 48 hours.  Suzanne Collins' writing style is electric, and I honestly could not put this book down. What I loved most is that Katniss is not your typical heroine. She isn't a particularly nice person when it gets down to it. She is loyal to her family, and to her that is all that is important, which is a wonderful trait for her to have, particularly given the dangerous and poverty stricken life she lives.  Peeta was a wonderful character that I took to straight away. Whilst it is probably true that Gale would be better suited to Katniss in temperament, I really loved how strongly Peeta felt for Katniss, and how he was willing to give up his life to keep her safe. They were complete opposites, but they seemed to fit perfectly, like two sides of a coin. Katniss' returning feelings for Peeta were wonderful to read, as we know that she does not love him in the same way, yet that is OK. We know that Katniss would never fall in love easily. She is too stubborn and level-headed to believe that love would help her in any way, so it was wonderful for her to realise that love does exist and that maybe she could one day be capable of giving it.  The story of the capitol and the games was tragic. It gives us a reminder at just what the future could hold for the planet, should repression of rights continue as it is in some countries. How far will the leaders of the world go in a bid to maintain order? A thoughtful and quite frankly scary idea, but so cleverly put into writing.  5 stars and a definite recommended read!
After reading about this book in the New Yorker, I was really looking forward to reading the book. After reading it,  I have to say that I am perplexed by the cult-like following that it seems to have attracted. This is probably the highest ranked book on GoodReads and I am quite sure that it does not deserve that. Although this does not really affect my rating, it is hard for me to write about the book without mentioning it.  The good  I found the book well written and easy to read (in a good sense). It makes good use of the first person narrator (Katniss) who is telling us her story with some perspective. The character is interesting and engaging. She is brave in the face of challenges that nobody should have to face. And she is  talented and smart. I can see how she is attractive to many readers. In some ways she reminds me of Bilbo or Frodo Baggins (J.R.R. Tolkien 4-Book Boxed Set: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings (Movie Tie-in): The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, The Return of the King)-- who started out innocent and weak and were forced to adapt to many challenges. Granted the hobbits were quite a bit richer than Katniss!  I also appreciate the use of dystopian world to criticize some excessed in our world. A good book should talk to us in a meaningful way.  The Bad  However, the story itself is some predictable. Of course, lots of stories are and are still fun. But since the world and character seem quite unreal to me, the challenge also does not seem real. There is nothing wrong with making up a world and this does not normally bother me. But  the best fictional world have a certain internal logic to them. Panem (the country where Katniss lives) does not. It seems to be in our world and yet the economy does not too much sense (10,000 people living in a district mining coal in a rather primitive and inefficient way in a futuristic society with a lot pretty amazing technology).  I don't believe that there is a girl like Katniss or a world like Panem. They just seem too perfect (the former) and imperfect (the latter) to me. Although there are a lot of really good heroes in the literary world, it is pretty normal to give them a flaw or two. It makes the story more interesting and all the more satisfying. I guess Katniss has her arrogance, her poverty, and her absolute devotion to her family.  Yes, I get the idea of the adolescent rage at the system or the need to rebel or something. And the book shows a strong and spunky protagonist who is doing just that. And yes, I understand the need to scream about all of the commercialism and "reality" shows out there. But somehow, I think that if these are the main issues, the story should have a setting that one can relate to.  And I find the violence a bit disturbing. Some books are able to have to great battles without actually showing the blood. Think about the Hobbit (the book, not the movie!), there is lot of fighting but how is it described? I suppose if you want to make a point about the horror of wars or something, you might want to show the pain and the blood and so on. But I don't think that this is the case here at all. In such stories, the ending is not predictable. Also the gratuity almost stands in contrast to the book's anti-commerical and reality show message...we are the ones enjoying it.  If you want a spunky girl who has to show unexpected courage (courage beyond the call of anybody's duty), what about To Kill a Mockingbird: 50th Anniversary Edition? This to me is a story that is every bit as exciting and not particularly predictable. And a heck of lot more profound. Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1) also deals with youth thrown into an impossible and unfair situation. Both of these points manage to make their points quite effectively without any of the violence.
There is no denying, Suzanne Collins trilogy, beginning with The Hunger Games, has become a cultural phenomenon. Growing up, I can remember the excitement I felt, waiting for the latest Harry Potter novel or movie to be released. Today, with the Twilight series, Hunger Games, the Millennium  Trilogy, even Fifty Shades of Grey, it seems like every series is advertised as the next big phenomenon.  I was hesitant to dive into The Hunger Games, but when a friend provided me with a copy, I decided to give it a shot.  The novel takes place in the nation of Panem. Basically, North America has been divided into 12 districts, each serving a specific economic purpose. Each year, in commemoration of the revolution and probably more in an attempt to remind the citizens of the leaders' power, each district is required to send one boy and one girl to participate in a televised battle to the death known as The Hunger Games.  Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a skilled hunter from the coal mining district 12, finds herself thrust into these games when she volunteers to enter in place of her younger sister. She will have to face career tribute, people who have specifically trained to compete in the games, so she is almost certain the battles will result in her death. Her hunting skills come in handy, however, and with the guidance of Haymitch, a drunken winner of a previous games, she soon becomes a serious contender. But survival isn't easy. To win, she is forced to make life or death decisions, face taking the lives of other, and risk betraying relationships.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the novel. The opening, where much of the backstory and preparation take place, was a bit slow. That being said, the story kicks into an unputdownable gear as the games actually begin. Like any good reality television program, I found myself sucked into the action as it was presented. I did feel that the characters were not as deeply realized as they could have been, but as the first novel in a trilogy, I expect they become more layered in later installments. While The Hunger Games is by no means perfect, it does successfully entertain while still provided clever commentary on social and cultural conventions.
The Hunger Games: Book Review  By: Morgan Rawle  I read the magnificent book The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. This book is written in first person point of view. Also, if you are in the mood for a young adult, science fiction adventure novel, this book is perfect for you! The Hunger Games makes me feel smitten by the excitement and suspense. Know that when you read this book, it will make you want to sit down, read, and keep reading until you've finished. Suzanne Collins is so descriptive and detailed when she talks about the setting. The narrator of this book is Katniss, the main character. Her perspective is more tense and protective than a normal writer's. I adore how her writing varies in styles. For example, when Katniss talks about her younger sister, she speaks very protectively. Whereas when Katniss speaks to Gale, she is laid back and relaxed. You never know what Katniss is going to do next!   The setting adds so much effect to the story.  The fact that it is set in the future makes it so much more exciting.  It takes place after a world war that destroys everything.  A new world civilization is created where the country is divided depending upon its resources.  These are called districts.  There are twelve districts. Some are based on farming and agriculture while others are based on mining and electricity.  In fact, one important part of the setting is the arena.  This is the place where most of the action happens.  The tributes are sent there to fight to the death.  The arena is interesting because the climate and the environment are controlled by the game makers.  It changes and makes the actual games more difficult for the tributes.  The setting creates a spectacular image in your mind that takes you into the world of the Hunger Games.   The characters in The Hunger Games are spot on.  For example, Katniss, the girl who would abandon her own life to save her little sister, Prim, is relentless.  She is very resourceful and a great role-model for young women.  Some of Katniss's intelligent skills are that she is amazing at archery; she is also very wise when it comes to which plants are safe to eat.  Peeta, on the other hand, is so gentle and kind-natured any girl would be lucky to have him for a husband.  Peeta has so many skills, including baking, designing cookies, camouflaging, and so many other things.  I for one am utterly in love with Peeta Mellarck.  Both Katniss and Peeta are from District 12.  All of those people work in the mines or go to school.  Also, Rue is one of my all-time favorite characters.  She is so sweet hearted and down to earth.  If I could be anyone in this book it would be her.  The characters in this book are indisputably magnificent.   This book contains action, love affairs, and suspense. This book leaves you gripping the edges of the book wanting to find out what happens next. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
?The Hunger Games (Book 1) (HG, Book 1) by Suzanne Collins 5 stars? and a favorite?  *?Review for October 2014:?*  Reread on kindle (5??) w/ audio (4?).  (Kindle Trilogy edition &amp;  Overdrive library audiobook read by Carolyn McCormick)  ?The book: 5??  I had first read this series in the summer of 2012. And then reread it right away because I loved it so much. Loved the suspense and the emotions from it. And then I watched and rewatched the movies. The first time seeing it, I felt was good but took away some of that raw emotion and deep character development.  I've recently reread The Hunger Games and it still grabbed me. This time I was read it along with the audiobook read by Carolyn McCormick. She did just ok. I still love the book and give that 5 stars. But the audiobook didn't capture it enough for me, so 4 stars.  I am still pulled along with Katniss Everdeen throughout the story. I enjoyed the first person narrative (and in fact because hungry or thirsty myself whenever Katniss did). She is a great example of a reluctant hero (or this case heroine). Even at the end, she still doesn't want to be the Victor, and not for a rebellious reason too.  Still love Prim and Rue and ?&lt;SPOILERS&gt; this time I even got teary-eyed because I know what's to come.&lt;/end spoiler&gt;.?  ?The audiobook: 4?  I really didn't like Carolyn McCormick's voice for Prim and Rue and sometimes the other characters. And I really, truly didn't like her "singing" voice, if you can call it that. I did think Carolyn's accent was spot-on for the Capitol characters. Especially loved her voice for Effie. And then I found myself reading ahead of the audiobook a few times. Maybe because the book just has me gripped or because McCormick just talked a little too slow at some of the climatic parts.  I will be given her a second chance though for Catching Fire... (bought the iTunes audio last year for about $3).  .  *?Review from 2012:?*  Like this series a lot.  Great suspense. Own the hardcover series.  Am currently reading the books on Prime on my Kindle Fire classic.  This series is gripping and well written. The book has more depth than the movie and I'm glad I read this before seeing the movie. The series as a whole is well set. As a fellow veteran, I can see how Katniss dislikes these horrible killings for pleasure. And she is right - killing a human is different than hunting for animals. We are meat eaters but we're not cold blooded killers by nature. We are not emotionally built that way.  Currently borrowing ebook from Amazon as a Prime member. Find it is easier to make notes and look up words with kindle edition.  Second time reading this book. First time was beginning of summer of 2012. Bought the hardcover set.  I can see the connections Collins makes with 'the games' vs. the Roman's gladiator games. As a society we haven't changed much. We have reality shows like "The Amazing Race," "Wipeout,'" and for the romatics there's "The Bachelor." These reality shows are for our "enjoyment."  But what's next?
This book appeals to me because  1. it convincingly describes the plight of the poor [always touches a chord with me, coming from poor upbringings myself],  2. it describes the obliviousness of the "out of touch" privileged who feel that the poor should be PROUD to have their lives treated like the playtoys of the 1%, and  3. it covers believable [though I admit I'm not certain if AUTHENTIC] survival skills that level the playing field, as it were, in class warfare--Katniss wins because she has a greater desperation to survive than those from the upper districts who treat life-or-death as just another silly game and don't know what it's like to truly have to fight for one's life.  This book repulses me because  1. it glazes over the seriousness of the consequences of having a government in power that SANCTIONS MAKING ITS CITIZENS KILL EACH OTHER [though by the time the book is established, the country has been crushed under an iron fist to such a point of general complacency that it's unfathomable that any of the repressed could have ever allowed it to persist for SEVENTY-FOUR YEARS],  2. it focuses mostly on this predictably awful pseudo-love-triangle romance [I get Peeta's sincerity, but I cringed when he started acting like an exhibitionist player, telling Katniss it was fine if she saw him naked] with WAY too much internal monologuing [telling vs. showing], but mostly,  3. IT'S WRITTEN IN PRESENT TENSE.  For all the other problems the Hunger Games books might have, the use of present tense is the hardest to forgive, because it's such an unnatural expression of narrative. The only times present tense works is in scripts [because the action DOES happen as it's being acted], Choose Your Own Adventure novels or "Dick and Jane" books [because the reader is actively being drawn in as a participant], and instruction manuals [because it's the use of imperative]. I guess maybe in reviews like this, too, but not when I'm describing a thing that happened in the book--IT ALREADY HAPPENED. It is not still happening!  Honestly, I would've given another star had all the action been past tense, but as it is, every sentence is the visual equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard. I've had friends comment that the use of first-person is just as bad, that first-person should NEVER be used in a story--while I don't feel quite the same way to that extreme [I've read some good first-person journal-style stories], the series definitely could've been helped by the third-person perspective used in the movie adaptation, being able to see vs. taking it on Katniss's word that President Snow is a deeply wicked person, for instance.  Overall, this is what I think doesn't work [***SPOILERS***]:  - The story doesn't begin until the Hunger Games start--there is so much haphazard effort put into world-building that Collins forgets to actually tell a story. Yes, there are things that are presumably important for exposition, but they are so drawn out as to read like a teenager's summer camp journal. Yes, the Reaping was a key emotional point, but--on the whole--the entire story could have been written more efficiently and covered more ground than it has. For instance, there could have been a dry introductory chapter with a third-person narrator describing the world, how the Districts' rebellions were crushed and the Hunger Games instituted. As an internal monologue, it reads like Katniss has to stop every ten minutes and remember something that happened years ago. Even having one character TELL the history of, say, Mockingjays to another character would read better than Katniss just remembering it to herself.  - Katniss is good at surviving... but that's it. She's not really likeable except in that she has the sense not to glamourize death and wants to protect the innocent. She strings along Peeta as a survival mechanism--because it will increase her chances of winning and, possibly, avoiding having to kill him--and keeps emphasizing how she has to put on a show vs. maybe being a little more honest and possibly risking the chance that no one will sponsor them. She has no real plans beyond "don't die," and when they return to District 12, all she can think about is having to keep putting on a show for the people, OH, and maybe also dealing with the backlash from the hinted-at uprisings.  - Avoxes: Who cares. Okay, sure, maybe they're important in the other two books, but it feels like just one more "Look how evil the Capitol is!" hook, at the expense of doing nothing for the current book but filling space. This is improved with their omission from the movie adaptation, I feel--but then, I was one of those philistines who saw the movie first and read the book to see what they changed.  - WHERE IS THE MORAL. I kept hoping there would be at least SOME kind of conclusion, some evidence that Katniss was changed by the Games beyond "Yay, I won... for NOW." Nope, the book is one big Chapter 1 of 3. I even skipped to the end of Mockingjay (Book 3) to see if the ending was worth reading the other two books--Katniss has two kids that Peeta has to TALK HER INTO HAVING, and they don't even have NAMES. What. It's comes across as not an ending so much as, "Well, I'm out of ideas. I'll stop here." The obvious social commentary is lost under the "bread and circuses" of the spectacle--which may be the point, that we so-called civilized people are so out of touch with our humanity that "kids killing each other" doesn't bat an eye so much as gets our blood pumping to see more. What should be one of the most horrifying things imaginable is a mere amusement at the box office. Yes, you might say, "Well, it's just FICTION," but can you really say there aren't still people in this world who want to see that for real? I mean, where do you think murderers come from?  I've tried to like this series, honest. The movie's performance is a slap in the face to the sexist Hollywood producers who think "strong female characters" don't sell well because they think "strong female characters" consist of scantily-clad women performing ludicrous acts of violence to a terrible farce of a script. It's also a slap in the face to the racists who can't read "dark hair and dark skin" as being black [or even "not white"]--"It ruined the movie for me!" GOOD, I say. Really, though, there was so much promise squandered by shoddy execution, and as much as I've fished for the gems in this book, I can't ignore the sludge I had to go through to get there.  tl;dr: Watch the movie--it's a little better, but not by much.
While the party may have ended, the band has packed up their instruments and is boarding their bus back to Panem, the streamers have been torn down by the kiddos, and everything that could have been said about THE HUNGER GAMES has probably already been said, I still feel the need to review it. Why? Because I've never been very good at marching in step with the rest of the crowd. Plus, as I write this, THE HUNGER GAMES occupies #9 of the Amazon Kindle eBooks Bestseller List for only the 840th day.  So how did Suzanne Collins create this international party with a rabid group of followers? By writing a damn good novel, and despite catering to the YA crowd, she held nothing back with the violence, as she dropped it across the blood spattered pages. As for her main character Katniss Everdeen, she is the real hero of this story, and she's the glue that holds this entire novel together. Without being inside of her head every second of this novel, the entire structure on which it is built would fall apart. You can claim that this should have been written in third person, and that it would have added suspense, as well as rounded out the other characters. But it would have changed the focus of the novel entirely, and it would have lacked immediacy. In order for first person to work successfully, a novel needs a strong, well-defined main character. Check and check.  She does a great job with world-building, and I was sucked right into the kiddie pool with the surroundings, circumstances, characters, districts, and everything else that she so expertly articulated. So what if the love triangle is overdone? Without it, the story would have lacked heart. Besides, if you really want to talk plot, there are only seven basic plots, according to Cristopher Booker. Sure, this number ends up being a bit arbitrary, but it's not like authors have an unlimited number of plots to choose from. So what it really boils down to is execution. Over and over again this book proves its point with Katniss, the quick flip of the pages (or push of the button for us Kindle users), the action scenes, how far we get into Katniss's head, and the world-building. If you haven't already hopped on THE HUNGER GAMES phenomenon, you better board the bus now, or you're liable to miss out on the after-party.

Katniss is sixteen, but she has yet to experience the slightest intimacy beyond a familial kiss. As the oldest child in the family, she is tasked with the unenviable job of providing for her mother and younger sister when her father perishes in a mining accident. Set in the near future, most residents of Pan-Am are forced to subsist through utter capitulation to the Capitol's whims. The only ways out are to break the law and hunt outside the district (which carries a capital sentence), or prove victorious in the annual Hunger Games.  Being forced to live off the land for years, pairing her natural talent for archery with Gale's instinct for setting snares, they eke out a comfortable, if arduous, existence in District 12. Until Katniss' sister Prim is chosen for the Hunger Games, despite only having one slip with her name in the Reaping. I expect this "coincidence" to play a prominent role in the following two books.  The bulk of the book is fast-paced, with occasional flashbacks to Katniss' past, and how she seems to be the only lady in the family without a talent or desire for treating the sick and injured. Although she has her father's talent for calling out to the Mockingjays, she chooses not to do so, preferring the practical and more immediate fruits of hunting and gathering.  The Games themselves are never dull (particularly because the Game Masters can't afford to rely on nature and the killer instincts of the contestants to whittle down the numbers). Any tribute who gets complacent or is lucky enough to enjoy a cushy half-day or two is immediately beset by traps, lack of resources, or anything else that could lie in store for them (including genetically engineered killing machines). They know their lives are not held in high esteem by the Capitol, and the only way to increase one's chances of survival is to appeal to one's sponsors, a task that becomes exponentially more difficult the longer the Games continue, and the more delirious the betting becomes.  The Hunger Games is excellently written and paced, and while Katniss' introspective analyses of her personality, her emotions and her life can get tedious at times, it doesn't adversely affect the experience overall. It soon becomes apparent that while Katniss is unfamiliar and uneasy with the concepts of romance and love, she still has a firm grasp on her humanity. Love has been abandoned, alone in her soul, but it is far from dead. A sense of duty, obligation and debt has replaced it, and she hates being in anyone's debt (although she soon learns that this is sometimes unavoidable, and some debts can never be repaid, at least not in the conventional sense).
The Hunger Games has some flaws, many of which are pointed out in these reader reviews.  I found it difficult to follow the first person, present tense narrative for the first 50 pages before my mind and eyes settled in on that writing style.  It has been accused of plagiarizing Battle Royale and Collins' character development skills have come under question.  The totalitarian society lacks definition and there are some amazing twists that solve pressing plot problems.  All this is true, however...  Not every book needs to be perfectly done.  Not all books define characters in a satisfying way and most books take thoughts and ideas from other works.  To define a "good read" one only has to answer the question "does it take you away from the day-to-day for a few hours and interest you in a different world?"  Good books provide an escape and maintain a level of anticipation that keeps the reader wondering what comes next.  How will our protagonists get out of this mess?  On these accounts, The Hunger Games is a good book and I'm confident that the second and third books will have the same positive attributes.  It has the additional benefit of being wildly popular with young readers.  Middle and high school students have embraced and devoured these books in unprecedented numbers.  Before the admonishments on the brutality and cruelty exhibited in The Hunger Games, I'm sure our teens have seen much worse on cable tv and video games.  The fact that it has attracted a veritable army of teenage "readers" only bodes well for the future literacy of our young ones.  Sure, its not Shakespeare, but reading anything at this age is way better than reading nothing at all and it may just light a spark of interest which someday may become a raging fire.  If you doubt me, read it yourself.  It's worth the price.  And while you're at it, buy one for your teenage child, niece, nephew, grandkid or neighbor.  That is, if they haven't already read it.

I have never been so in awe of an author in my life (admittedly it isn't a spectacularly long one). I set myself up to be freaked out and put off by the violence but it wasn't like that at all.  Set in future North America in a country called Panen, Katniss Everdeen, a girl of 16, spends her days providing for her mother and sister in a place called District 12. The book is set around an annual event called the Hunger Games, in which  a boy and girl from each of the 12 districts in Panem are set into an arena to fight to the death and watched on live TV. This is as payment to the Capitol, the city in Panem, after the districts rebelled 74 years previously.  After Katniss' sister is called up to fight at the Reaping, she volunteers to take her place and is delivered off to the Capitol to be prepared, knowing only one person can survive.  Now I had the idea that the area would be some kind of gladiator ring, or just out in the wilderness. I didn't realise that Capitol had complete control over the arena, rigging up certain areas to pose more dangers to the tributes. It worked really well and added more danger that made the chance of survival remote. In fact, it wasn't at all what I expected, which made it all the more better - I hadn't imagined the book would be like it is at all.  The structure of the book may take some getting used to but it works really well and compliments the first person style. I loved the humour in the book and felt like I was living in the arena with Katniss and the other tributes. It pulled me in and I read each book one after another. And then again. And again.  I loved these books soooo much and wish I could unread them, just to get the privilege of reading them again! If you haven't read them yet, I would definitely try now, especially if you haven't seen the film. The book is a lot better and really worth the read!
The Hunger Games:   I'm one of those people who doesn't like to conform and jump on bandwagons when society comes up with these trends that come and go. When I read the syllabus and found out that I had to read the Hunger Games I was not too thrilled, but was slightly interested to see who this Katniss character was. I thought this book was interesting but not all that it was cracked up to be. I wasn't sure how I felt about it but I couldn't stop reading because I needed to find out what happened. It was hard for me to think into the future and how America could ever end up like that.   My favorite parts were reading about the thirteen colonies and how the story flashed forward into the future. I was interested in reading about the government and how overpowering they were to send people to fight for their lives. This part of the story was very relatable especially with the upcoming elections and ads on tv. Sometimes I feel like the government now is like that. I felt myself getting emotional during the game makers and when people were chosen. When Katniss takes her sisters place I felt like I was right there with her. I wondered if I could ever do that for my sister and if she would ever do that for me. I also liked the romance between Peeta and Prim. I liked the role reversal and how they played opposite gender personalities. Katniss was strong and Peeta was open.   I really did not like reading about the love triangle between Katniss, Peetas, and the guy from her district. I also couldn't get to like Katniss; she was very self absorbed and that made it hard for me to like her. I was really quite horrified by the concept of killing people to gain food for their district. The whole killing concept was really depressing and made me anxious. At times I felt like I was reading a bad newspaper article. I'm not too sure why this book didn't appeal to me because I know that I am the minority of the population who didn't like it. I also did not like how the author left out descriptions of the characters. I found this rather hard to envision what these characters looked like and therefore made it hard for me to picture the story playing out in my head. I couldn't tell you the setting or what the district looks like. I feel like these are main points that make a story a story.   I believe the main concepts of this book are about coming of age rituals and the adolescent years. But this book shows struggles that adolescents face and how they overcome them. This story showed how a girl became a woman and how she has to make decisions and choices in a crazy world. She's forced to grow up and make adult decisions and hold responsibility. Sometimes, in our society, adults think that adolescents are not capable of making these types of decisions.  I also could relate to this story because Katniss and her district were the poorest and their struggles could relate to Appalachia.
Katniss Everdeen volunteers to be District 12's female "tribute" to the annual Hunger Games because she can't bear to let her little sister, 12-year-old Prim, accept that lottery assigned role. Katniss knows it's a death sentence, because each district must send two tributes to the Games - one boy and one girl - and only one can survive. The tributes will be trained, placed in an arena with unknown conditions (anything from desert to arctic), and left there until they've killed each other off. That is the ongoing punishment the Capitol visits on its once rebellious districts, and as far as Katniss knows no one has ever challenged the Games and their rules in 75 years. Winning means a lifetime of ease for the winner, and a year of Parcels for every citizen of that young person's district. Since people commonly starve to death in District 12, those parcels mean survival. And at first, Katniss doesn't care if she has to kill the male tribute from District 12 along with everyone else who enters the arena. Peeta, the local baker's son, was kind to her once when it made all the difference; and Katniss's reaction to that is hated of indebtedness. She only hopes that her well-honed hunting skills, learned from her dead father and practiced through years of illegally taking game to feed her mother and Prim, will be enough to carry her to victory. Unlikely though that seems, it is all she has...and then things get worse, as she learns that Peeta loves her and she begins to want him to survive, too.  This young adult novel is, like so many good ones in that class, entirely readable for adults as well. It's scary enough so I'm glad I could not encounter it while I was an YA reader myself, quite a few years before its publication. Its first person, present tense viewpoint is one I don't usually enjoy, but in this case that viewpoint works because it gives immediacy to Katniss and her situation. One crisis follows another - at times the story moves almost too fast, as both Katniss and the reader struggle to keep up with what the Gamekeepers as well as her fellow contestants are throwing at her. The one thing I find hard to believe is Peeta's sincere and completely self-sacrificing love for Katniss, which doesn't change no matter how she behaves. He seems a bit too saintly, in that respect at least, to stay credible.  A real roller coaster ride of an adventure that has a point, as a good YA novel always does. In this case the point (in my estimation) is that people don't know what they are capable of until survival, their own, hangs in the balance. I agree with the reviewer who says that one must accept the author's premise in order to suspend disbelief, and I can understand why that might not work for everyone. But it did work for me.  --Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner "Regs"
** spoiler alert **  Let me start by saying I started this book expecting to be disappointed. I was pleasantly shocked when I realized I was moving from that expectation to not wanting to stop reading! So, here's why:  Firstly, I don't like reading in the first person. There's usually a lot of commentary coming from the voice of the primary character that would not be in a normal person's inner monologue (e.g., "I'm so tired I feel like a building has fallen, pinning me to the ground" vs "I'm so tired I can't even muster the energy to move an inch"). Suzanne Collins did not write in the way that irritates me and so now I have to reassess my distaste for 1st person writing -- well done, Ms. Collins!  Secondly, I tend to stay away from books intended for young readers because I find they're toned down to be accepted by that audience. The end result is usually a lack of reality/grittiness that would occur if the characters were in a real-world situation. The Hunger Games may be written with words and style that are easily consumed by younger readers, but the world she presents is clearly not intended for children. It's full of palpable danger, pain, and pleasure. Again, I give my kudos to Ms. Collins.  Those are writing elements, but let me move on to the characters and different parts of the actual story:  Likes:  * The monologue in Katniss' voice seemed real to me instead of contrived just for the sake of the reader. There are times when she does step outside of the "now" to relate a previous story, encounter, or similar in full detail that is obviously exposition. Perhaps it happened so seldom that it didn't seem forced. I prefer as little exposition as possible, but stories like how Katniss got the goat, or how her sister wore a hand-me-down until it was rags do have a place. It's a tough balance when writing in 1st person. I still prefer 3rd.  * The violence and emotions of the different characters was not toned down. They were in a very deadly situation in the arena and that was effectively delivered. The survival of the non-Careers was questioned from the start, and some of them were dispatched in a rather grizzly manner. This is what I DID NOT expect and what I am glad I received.  * There was romance, which I normally despise in a story (book/show/movie) because it seems contrived for the pleasure of those who like that sort of element in a story. In the Hunger Games, the romance aspects were absolutely and completely necessary for the story to unfold as it did. Without Katniss playing up their romance to the Games' audience, they would not have made it out alive.  * When Katniss finally realizes she has no concept of the actual passage of time in the arena, that really hits home for me because I also have no sense of time as the book progresses. It was a nice aspect from Kat's perspective that was relatable.  Dislikes:  * Some of the details were sort of silly -- the way the people of the Capitol dress; the bio-engineered creatures that were used as weapons; the love of a boy since age 5. These details, and probably a few more, were unrealistic to me and detracted slightly from my suspension of disbelief. The ideas that "people would never want to appear as a joke" or "there are easier ways to make a weapon that bio-engineering" always run through my head when I see that sort of thing in a story.  * That Kat could read JUST ABOUT EVERYONE else in the story except Peeta with regards to subtext and body language is slightly absurd. Sure, she had no real experience with what adult love could look like, but they were together long enough for her to get something from him. She was with him as long as Haymitch and she could think inside Haymitch's head. She is a born empath and that is not fully executed.
What more can be said about a book that has close to 100,000 reviews on goodreads?  Over 900,000 readers have rated The Hunger Games an average of 4.5 stars. They say that 5 star reviews are the author's friends and family in which case Suzanne Collins must have a lot of friends or a very big family. But the ratings are high for good reason: the story of an apocalyptic future in which teenagers are selected through a national lottery to battle others to the death is believable and compelling.  The first act of the book is the strongest, with characters who have depth and are very well nuanced as they navigate their daily lives to forage, hunt and trade for food in a police state that is the America of the future. It's here that we are introduced to Katniss Everdeen of District 12 (`The Seam'), the coal producing region. The irony of her being `chosen' to play in the Hunger Games is a good twist in a book full of twists. Peeta, her male counterpart who works in his father's bakery, is a nice kid when you get right down to it and has always had a soft spot for Katniss. Or does he? Remember--only one can survive the Hunger Games.  The theme of how one communicates and carries oneself in a world where no one can really trust another and love is manufactured is very well done and possibly one of the reasons this book appeals as it does to young adults. I found the relationship between Katniss and Peeta dynamic, full of tension and tenderness.  The book is not without its faults however. The second act, dealing with the games themselves--the heart of the story--is often told through long narrative passages in which the pace tends to sag. Many key events are taken off camera and the reader has to work at remembering the many contestants who were briefly introduced. At times the action writing tends toward the generic and lacks the wonderful detail seen in the first act. This is a surprise when you consider that this is primarily an action story. But wait, there is another twist. Just as we think we know how it's going to end we are turned around.  All in all, this is a very satisfying book that sets the standard in a crowded genre. The Hunger Games won't disappoint readers of any age.
So I realize I'm behind on this "Hunger Games" phenomena, but I've finally jumped on that bandwagon. I recently bought the entire series, and in less than 24 hours I've already devoured the first book of the series.  The Hunger Games is a thrilling futuristic tale of a country and government gone terribly wrong. The country, Panem, is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol. The Capitol forms the government that pretty much controls all districts, and on a specific period of every year, there occurs what is called the day of the Reaping. The reaping involves randomly choosing one boy and one girl of every district to participate in the annual Hunger Game event. With 24 participants, there can only be one survivor. The purpose of this appalling game? To remind the people who is in charge, and who is in power by punishing their children after the districts attempted to rebel against the Capitol many years ago.  The Hunger Games is reality TV at its most realistic. It is a fusion of Big Brother and Survivor, only at its most extreme. With the cameras, the government surveillance, the public mind control and the political agenda involved it reminded me so much of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four - which is another futuristic, yet classic novel written in 1949. To me, this almost seemed like the young adult version of it, and I think that's fantastic. About time someone ventured to write such a serious novel, placed in a fantasy fiction setting with a blend of romance, for the younger generations to read. In fact, parts of it (specifically those that took place in the arena), was very reminiscent of Lord of the Flies in its savagery, and other parts of it reminded me of Harry Potter's Goblet of Fire tournament.  Suzanne Collins, you are a genius. Finally, another good series I can obsess about - the last one being J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.  Okay now, off to read the next installment!
It didn't take very long for the story to grip me. The dystopian world, the sympathetic characters, the quick-moving plot: everything works to make this book in a page-turner.  We meet Katniss as she prepares for hunting in the woods, which is illegal but widely accepted by the authorities of the district, as they also gain from it. Katniss is responsible for her mother and her little sister, Prim, since her mother suffered a breakdown after the death of her father. She hunts with Gale, her best friend, and they share skills and resources to feed both their families.  The book begins a few days before the Reaping. We get Katniss' point of view as she reflects on the consequences of the reaping and its injustice. At their core, the Hunger Games are a version of Roman gladiator shows: a way to control the outer provinces and provide entertainment to a blasé, luxurious capital population. In the book, the history of the Hunger Games begins with a war, after which the Hunger Games are implemented to "remind" the people, every year, of the Capitol's power over them. Attendance to the reaping is mandatory, and so is watching the Games. Think "Gladiator" meets "Big Brother" in a dictatorship.  I felt instant sympathy for Katniss. In a world where living illegally is the only way to eat enough, where social injustice is rampant (and in fact institutionalized) and where children are held hostage against rebellion, her struggle to act morally despite the cruelty around her is heroic.  As soon as the Games start, the plot picks up its pace and keeps you turning the pages all the way to the end. Her true/fake love affair with Peeta, which keeps both of them alive, is particularly fraught with teenage anxiety around relationships and desire. But ultimately, this is about survival. Who do you live for? What are you willing to do to survive?  The writing, despite its slight faults, is gripping and evocative. Collins has a way to describe horrific scenes in a way that retains the violence, but maintains respect for the human victims. The book left me hungry for more.
One thing for sure, I immediately connected with the characters. I didn't know what the "Hunger Games" were, but by page 13, I wanted to cry for the children. They lived a hard life but made the best of it. More than that, they flourished in their own ways despite being in an environment which would break a lot of people.  When I did learn about the "Hunger Games" I was appalled. Ms. Collins brought the incomprehensible to life. This novel was high on the list at goodreads.com as one book people would like to see made into a movie. I could see why. I spent a lot of time blinking back tears.  I've heard a lot of critters say to lay off the back story. It's a rule Ms. Collins did not follow, and I'm glad for it. Each bit of back story was a treasure, rich in a way which added depth to her characters. I savored every moment.  As for the YA aspect, I thought the novel was very age appropriate. It's a novel I'd let my daughters read. Though there was a lot of violence, each choice had real consequences. Decisions were not made lightly, and Katness was very aware of the stakes. It broke my heart her world wasn't one of innocence. It reminded me of the easy life I take for granted. For them, it was as if every small kindness was the greatest miracle.  Memorable lines from Hunger Games  Katniss: District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety.  To the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, not one person claps.  A Tribute: Only...I want to die as myself.  His rage is so extreme it might be comical -- so people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists -- if I didn't know that it was aimed at me, at what I have done to him.  I take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cameras, and dreading the moment when I finally have to let go.  This was a book I didn't want to put down.
Katness Everdeen will live into my thoughts for many years to come. The first book, The Hunger Games, is a story with this amazing heroine.  People of in her District are cut off from food most of the time, and communication from the rest of the world (only propaganda is show on TV by the Capital. All this takes place thousands of years after a kind of nuclear apocalypse, but they live more like the Middle Ages, with starvation and illnesses killing off the young and weak.  Katness finds ways, with her friend, Gale to feed her family (by hunting in forbidden lands), but these adventures ultimately train her to be fast with a bow and arrow, her choice of weapons when the time comes.  Every year a raffle decides which young person will go off to fight for their lives in a game called "The Hunger Games," masterminded by the evil Capital as a means to keep everyone in the outlying Districts of this futurist world in check and "the Capital's way of reminding them of how totally they are at their mercy."  Devised after a so called "revolution," the games are used as a reminder of the Districts crimes against the Capital years before when they revolted.  One winner years ago still lives in her District, his name is Haymitch and adds some comic relief throughout the story--gruff but loveable, he becomes her mentor.  Everyone tries not to think about the "Reaping" but it come too soon every year.  When the Reaping begins in her district, shockingly, her little sister is picked!  Prim's only 9 years old!  To save her sister, Katness volunteers to go instead.  She's not a likely heroine, other than she wants to save her sister, her other motive is pure survival, though she doesn't think she'll win the games.  She never, not even in future books, realizes how strong she really is! Katness expects to hate everyone at the Capital, but she forms bonds with the team of stylists set out to make her beautiful and appealing, a sure way to garner sponsors. These relationships develop and a strange bond is formed that is never broken, not even in later books.  Of course, there's a sweet romance with another boy picked for the games, Peeta, who to this reader the real hero of these stories!  Katness is soon she's torn between what she thought she had with Gale and what the future holds with Peeta.  Hunger Games swept me away (unexpectedly) into a futuristic world where the lives of children are simply entertainment. Hunger Games has all the elements of suspense, surprise, love, meaningful relationships, told in a youthful narrative but relatable to any age. I couldn't stop reading it! I quickly bought the other two books and loved them all equally as much. I only wish there was going to be more! (I also saw the first move and thought they did an excellent job).
Let me tell you a crazy story -- my friend told me to read this book. I read the synopsis and thought 'who wants to read a book about teens killing other teens? what is this world coming to?' Then, my brother lent me the book and it sat on my desk for 2 months. Then, I traveled in other countries for 45 days straight with this book in my backpack thinking I "might" read it if I get bored or am on a long train ride. I never read it, and in fact during my travels I tried to trade it for something else with another backpacker. They didn't want it. So it came back with me, roundtrip, after seeing parts of Asia.  Three weeks ago, on a rainy day, I was bored and I thought let's see what the hype is about. I was sure I would put it down after 4-5 pages.  Sixteen hours later I had finished the book. During that time, I barely looked up and engaged only in the most minimal human interactions and attended to the most minimal bodily needs!  This is maybe the BEST book I have ever read. I laughed, I cried, I stressed, I sweated, I smiled, I held my breath, I sighed with relief. It's so exciting, thrilling and yet so emotional. I have rarely been swept in this way by a book. For the next 3-4 days all I could do was think about the book -- while walking, while working, while eating, etc. I kept remembering the scenes and the dialogue.  There are like a million reviews on Amazon for this book, so my review means nothing probably. But, if you are reading it, I highly recommend this book and the series -- get it, read it, feel it, and read the 2nd one right after and then the third. And then pray that the author makes another series that will rock so hard that it will knock the bow and arrow out of Katniss Everdeen's grip.  If I could marry a book, this one would definitely be a contender in the finals. Three thumbs up, plus a bonus gold star!
I was very impressed with the whole trilogy. The three books raise so many hot topic issues that play out throughout the pages. For instance, the difference between revenge and justice, murder and survival, and the value of all life. It is not until you read the second book that the idea of stopping the cycle of past mistakes in society is touched upon. While yes, it is gruesome and at points very violent, the point is to see what could happen...how evil can morph into something ugly if power goes unchecked.  Some have criticized the book for being to over the top violent, pitting kids against one another. But history has shown many instances of societies doing unthinkable acts against one another (the holocaust, Darfur, ect..) and it is important to realize that again evil has no limits. It is meant to make you repulsed at the idea that this could happen, thus perhaps making the desire to insure that it doesn't stir.  The main character is very convincing, talking and thinking like a 14-16 year old would think. Kinda selfish, emotional, full of 'woe is me' one liners. She even goes through the ever popular teenage drama of who she wants to be with. Some might think this makes the book elementary, but I see it as a well defined and believable character. I fell in love with Peeta and his examples of unconditional love, but really all the characters are beneficial in their own way.  I would note that I do not recommend just reading the first book...because the point of the three books is to show the transformation of the characters, as well as to define moral obligation to injustice. I have heard it said that deep down this is a love story..and to an extent I would agree with that. But the undertones have so much more meat then that. It is a fast read...and it sucks you right into its plot. By the time I reached the last page of the first book, I could not get my hands on the second one fast enough! I would also recommend reading the book before venturing to see the movie. The only thing I did not care for was how fast the third book wrapped up. I for one wanted more detail.  But overall...great.
I heard of the Hunger Games while in school. A few classmates talked about how interesting it was, though at the time it was just a title to me, nothing more. I never picked up the book, too busy or simply not interested enough. The title of the book sounded odd, confusing me as to what it could possibly be about though that curiosity didnt pick up, until I saw that it was going to be a new upcoming movie.  Yes, just like the terror of Twilight, I feared that this book, now turned into a movie would be just as terrible, if not worse. Knowing that it was fairly popular already, especially with my peers, I worried that the hype of the movie would also in turn ruin the books. Despite all of this, I simply had to watch the film. Heading in with a skeptical point of view, I sat next to a friend who had already read the books, and prepared myself for the worst.  Alas! I was very very surprised. The movie was fabulous, the concept I simply swooned over. After watching the movie and reading the first book, I am extremely happy that I picked it up; even though delayed. I have never cried while reading before, though just as I did while watching the film, certain moments caused me to tear up while reading as well.  The back-story is much better explained in the book (of course) and I absolutely love the creativity put into it. Minor details did annoy me however. How Katniss despised her mother so severely for the way she had dealt with certain situations (not wanting to give away spoilers here), which to me made it seem like she was generalizing woman as weak. She was also fairly condescending in that manner, which also peeved me; but with that all aside, the characters I did enjoy, and the suspense during the games was thrilling. I would recommend this book to anyone. ^^
"Hunger Games" catches you almost in spite of itself.  For starters, it is not especially well-written.  Moreover, if you try to make too much sense of the rules of the game or the nature of this dystopic society, you will find yourself frustrated.  An analytical thinker will try and re-retry thoughts and ideas in what will ultimately be a futile attempt to make sense of the many inconsistencies in this dystopic society and its Hunger Games.  Author Suzanne Collins does not make a lot of effort to explain or resolve.  Nevertheless, the plot is compelling.  Drawing on such masterful classics as George Orwell's "1984," Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," "Fahrenheit 451," "Mad Max," "Death Race 2000" and other dystopic visions of future societies, readers will find it difficult to put this book down.  Written in a style that more suitable to a "young adult" reader, a more seasoned reader will still find plenty of pull.  A catastrophic war has rendered this loosely-disguised, post-21st century American society into a dictatorial state with a capitol city dominating 12 distinct regions.  All must pay tribute and remain in a vassal state.  This is the price of peace.  In a style reminiscent of the Roman gladiators, a male and female tribute are selected each year from each region to fight to the death in a nationally-televised, live "Hunger Game."  Death or victory will come to each tribute.  It is so very Roman in its heritage (including many of the names), it's a veritable "bread-and circuses" event that could have happened at the height of Roman Empire.  I've not yet seen the movie, wanting to read the book first.  Now that I've read it, it will be interesting to see how it has been transformed for the big screen.
I first received this book from my book addict twin Nicole with rants and raves about it, after she picked it up in an airport on her way home from Peru (I'm jealous that she goes on so many adventures) and finished it on her flight home. I let it sit on my shelf for awhile, until one day I went on a family fishing trip and since I never catch anything anyways, I figured I'd bring a book. After setting up my chair, baiting and casting the line I started reading.    I stumbled through the mundane first few chapters, and was about to give up because honestly not much was happening. When I look back on it now, I realize it was to set up the skills and back story that would be vital to Katniss later on. By the time we came to the ceremony where the tributes are chosen, I was hooked. There was no stopping me now that the ball was rolling, there was political intrigue, action, suspense and a cast of colourful and diverse characters.    I spent the next few hours completely enveloped in the book ( I lost track of time, didn't reapply sunscreen and got some pretty bad sunburn), and it was completely worth it to keep reading! It wasn't just a physical battle that went on here, there was so much political intrigue and survival strategies too.    The cover is pretty nondescript, plain and with me being a sucker for pretty things, I likely walked past it several times in a book store and didn't stop to look at it. The symbolism on it doesn't even become iconic until you get into the later parts of the story, but now with the impending release of the movie, the mockingjay pin and what it signifies has exploded into the mainstream as a very identifiable figure.  Collins did a great job building each set that the story takes place in, I didn't have a difficult time envisioning the soot covered village of district 12, or the dangerous expanses of forest to the metallic glamour of the Capitol.    The character of Katniss is loyal, fierce and willing to do whatever it takes - even killing, if it means her loved ones survive. She's a great strong character, and since she's from one of the worst off districts, it's great to see her rise up and be the underdog that no one expects.    I have to say out of the two main boys, Gale and Peeta, I definitely root for Gale, to me he was the more likable character. Gale is the confident, skillful childhood friend of Katniss who understands how much work it takes just to make sure their families have some food on the table at night. Whereas Peeta - although from the same district as Katniss and Gale, he tended to live a much more sheltered life and I honestly didn't think he'd hold it together for very long, but he definitely had some surprising tricks up his sleeve, and what he lacks in brute strength he makes up for in cunning.    The other characters such as Haymitch, Effie and Cinna each had a unique and easily distinguishable persona's. They were looser characters that were a great dynamic to Katniss' more serious focused persona. I especially love Cinna, he's a fashion designing genius!    Once the reader is pulled into the preparations for the Hunger Games the action and drama are so well balanced that it can definitely keep the attention of boys and girls alike. There are romantic elements, but they're kept to a minimum and don't really detract from the intensity of the storyline. There is quite a bit of graphic violence - but with the whole premise of the story being last one standing wins, it's pretty compulsory to have some kind of death and mayhem. Really it's no worse than your average action packed movie these days. After finishing this one, I immediately ran out and bought the box set because I HAD to know what happened next.
In this jaw-dropping novel by award winning author Suzanne Collins, a young female warrior in a post-apocalyptic world must battle other warriors to stay alive. Years before the story began, the common people revolted against their superiors and were unsuccessful. As punishment, this resulted in the establishment of the Hunger Games, an annual battle between twenty-four contestants who are forced to fight to the death. Katniss, the story's protagonist, comes from humble beginnings as her family lives in one of the country's poorest regions. Katniss' younger sister was chosen for the Hunger Games, but Katniss knew that she had to save her sister and volunteered to go instead. From there, Katniss headed to the Capitol (or main center of their district) to prepare for the games and did remarkably well in her practice. Peeta, the boy chosen to go with Katniss to the games, reveals in an interview that he has a crush on Katniss, possibly to gain support for sponsors of the game. As the games develop, alliances are created and friends are betrayed, sacrifices are made, and romance develops as the warriors get desperate. Katniss must persevere and fight through all this conflict if she wants to be able to return to her family.   Suzanne Collins purpose in writing this novel is to relate this topic to modern government as the social class gap continues to divide the population, and she wants to remind readers that a corrupt society such as the one depicted would not be impossible. To begin with, The Hunger Games is directly related to modern society as Occupy Wall Street movements testify to the growing social discontent between the poor and wealthy classes. If a violent revolt took place, this may be the future of society as we know it, because the wealthy class would dominate society and be easily able to subject the lower classes to their brutal laws and rituals, similar to the dominance of the Capitol in The Hunger Games. In addition, Collins had originally created this book in 2008 to deal with the possible dissolution of major countries in the distant future, for example, the United States. This book was written during a time in which the economy was in a frail state and it demonstrates the author's concerns for the economic welfare of the United States as many were questioning the possibility of an American economic comeback.   Going beyond the story, the author clearly wants the reader to support more equality for females. For example, Katniss is the leading character in the novel and is a strong willed, independent woman. By having the main character as a strong willed and warrior-like woman, it is obvious that the author supports feminists and feminism to strengthen women. Furthermore, by requiring that one male and female be selected from each district, the message that men and women are equal is more blatant. As the females and males can both be warriors, it is quite obvious that Collins supports gender equality in every aspect of life, even the unpleasant ones.    This book is an instant classic and it is well with reason to say it is one of the most successful books of this decade. The reasons why this book is so successful are simple: it is a romantic success story that everyone wants to hear, and it has just the right amount of action in it to keep readers entertained.  The romance appeals to females as Katniss struggles to find love. She has learned not to get attached to people because she feels she will eventually lose them. This is clearly evident as Katniss fakes romance with Peeta who shows much interest in her. Many readers can relate to her as they too have an unwillingness to love because of a fear of a loss of that love. On the other hand, males, such as myself, will enjoy this book for its more gruesome, wild, and action-packed moments. When the games began, I could not stop reading the book because my eagerness to see the next victim took over. This book is primarily recommended for high school students as the diction is not too sophisticated and it has the type of drama that high school students crave. Adults may want to read this as well, mainly because it is an interesting novel, but also because they can discover more about what the modern American teenager enjoys and thinks about. My only complaint about the novel is that the ending is somewhat predictable and expected. (Warning: Spoilers) The book ends with Katniss surviving the games along with Peeta as they romantically enter a train. To me, this is too cliché as the protagonist comes out of nowhere to win it all and even wins a date. Overall I would have to give this book 4 out of 5 stars as it was a fascinating novel, but I was able to foresee Katniss' triumph early on. This book is a must read for teens and should be read by adults, and it is worthy of being called one of the most successful books of the decade.
Suzanne Collins, author of the Hunger Games, grew up with a dad in the military and knew all about the aspects of war. This leads many to believe that this is why she based the Hunger Games around war, fighting, and violence. The Hunger Games is a novel about a future America that is split into multiple districts, which are all strictly controlled by the Capital. The Capital enjoys showing their dominance over these several districts by hosting a competition that is called the Hunger Games; these games are watched throughout the entire nation and 1 boy and 1 girl between the ages of 12 - 18 are chosen from each district. Katniss Everdeen takes the place of her sister and volunteers as tribute, she is going up against 23 other competitors- one of them she ends up falling in love with (Peeta Mellark). This book is an adventurous, suspenseful novel that also plays as a romance between two tributes from the same district fighting for survival in these dangerous games. Only one tribute is allowed to win; yet both Peeta and Katniss want to come about victorious together- so they story continues as a survival of the fittest and test of strength and determination. Suzanne Collins wrote this novel to show the negatives about society and to reflect a subject that she knows all to well- war.   Suzanne Collins's purpose in writing the Hunger Games is that she wanted to portray our society, and the violence that we live in; although much more exaggerated, she still wanted to get a point across that our society is selfish, violent and we are constantly controlled by a higher power. Suzanne also wanted to make sure her audience knew that one person can be influential and serve as a symbol of much significance; such as Katniss serving as a representation of hope and determination for the underprivileged districts. It is important to remember that the author grew up in a military family, so she recalls all the information of war and fighting- making it very simple for her to reveal these memories of violence in her book.   Throughout the novel, Suzanne Collins makes sure to emphasize her main purposes in writing this novel by exaggerating her points and characters. She wants to display how our society is selfish and vicious, Collins does this by showing the distinct split between extreme poverty and the life of luxury. The Capital could care less about the poor, deprived districts as long as they are living a wealthy, simple lifestyle. Collins also states a claim that us as individuals are constantly controlled by a higher power, such as the government. She supports this by showing how the Capital is constantly watching and keeping the districts under control and making sure they will not rebel, such as forcing the districts to give up their own kids- in doing this it reinforces the capitals overall dominance and superiority over the commoners. Collins also emphasizes the idea of symbolism and how one person can make a difference; Katiniss and Peeta end up diminishing the power of the capital and represent love, determination, and wit.   The book argues that society is greedy and everyone seeks violence and dominance over others. The argument Collins makes is quite convincing because it portrays the capital and the districts as complete opposites and really contrasts the 2 extremes of poverty and wealth, the games also represent this selfishness because everyone is fighting and willing to kill each other instead of fighting against the capital. The novel also argues that one person can make a difference and this is reinforced through her powerful characters, such as Katniss a self- determined, faithful girl who defeats the dominance of the Hunger games and Peeta who is a weaker individual yet loving and loyal- showing that you don't have to be the strongest to conquer over the higher power.   The Hunger Games is not just a typical war book about rebellion and fighting for your beliefs, it has its own style and involves romance, action, teenagers, and parents who must give up their children; which is why it relates to adults, younger kids, people who enjoy a thrill, and the more romantic individuals. This book is written in a way that will keep you interested throughout the whole novel, unlike other war books where it is slow in the beginning and only catches your attention during the fighting scenes. It is also not as mythical and unrealistic as other violent, romance novels such as the Percy Jackson series and Twilight.   Overall this book is a well-written novel that would appeal to a range of ages from 10- adults. Some parts of the book may be confusing and not as impacting as it should be to some younger readers. This book allows you to connect and even relate to the characters, making you experience a deeper level of interaction with the novel. In certain instances you can even feel the characters' pain and the suspense from the games. The Hunger Games is an amazing novel that everyone can relate to in some way, it allows you to let your imagination venture off and feel as if you are involved in the competition yourself. I highly recommend readers to begin this series, and you will not be disappointed.
REASON FOR BOOK CHOICE  I am an aggressive reader now, for sure, but I didn't used to be. As such I found out about Hunger Games via a trailer on Apple.com. It looked intriguing and the main character had a lean and angry feel to her that I hadn't seen in a while. I like kick ass female heroines and the story seemed to tick all my desirability boxes.  Then a few reviewers said the movie wasn't as great as it could be, so I passed and decided to wait for the DVD release. However, a couple of weeks ago I was trawling for a good book and I thought: Hunger Games, why not? I'm currently writing my own YA book and I thought that I should be pragmatic and check out the competition. I didn't expect it to be good, I certainly expect it to be great. It was just the new Twilight that I had to read because the world demanded it.  COVER  The cover for the Kindle version I purchased is the movie tie-in edition. I'm not sure what to think of that. I know that keeping your marketing material the same is a good idea, but would it be such an ask to have a unique Kindle cover that really takes advantage of its grey scale processing? We're not talking a single independent writer here, this is a professional squad. Surely they could design something that grabs you straight off from the get go.  The cover itself is fine. It's Katniss' mockingbird on fire and I already knew it looked great in print at the local bookshop. In greyscale, however, not so much. All the vividness and contrast has been drained out of the picture; therefore, even though it's in super high definition, it doesn't grab me on the Kindle.  It's also strange that the cover suffers from the 'blank space' issue a lot of books have around its left and right sides. I went off at Alan Parr last week about and I haven't changed my opinion. This is really lazy work and whoever put the book together for the Kindle should be spoken to about it. Yes, they would have to modify the file but it would be worth it.  BOOK LAYOUT  Even though the book still starts right into the novel (please, can we not do that?), I found it had all the essentials: TOC, chapter headings, acknowledgments and a really great way of promoting the next book. Unfortunately, I'm not a huge fan of the way the TOC had been laid out and although I understand it's not the Kindle version creator's fault (because he / she was staying true to the source material) it really reeks of sloppiness.  I can comprehend that fans of the novel would want it changed as little as possible from one version to another, but I'm not sure they would complain about aesthetic changes like chapter headings. I say this because the TOC chapter listings are 1, 2, 3 and so on. It works when you create a printed book because you can make those numbers really large but as TOC headings, it looks like an eighth grader put the table of contents together. Surely they could have changed them to One, Two, Three and kept the spirit of the book.  One thing I love about the layout is their marketing. At the very end of the novel is a picture promoting the new novel: Catching Fire, and it's great. It let's you know that the other book is available, what it's called and it's not trying to force you to read anymore. I'm already thinking for picking it up in the Christmas period (or when I have holidays) to add to my list of reading material.  STORY  The story is pretty well known by now: Katniss has voluntarily put herself forward to compete in the Hunger Games so that she can save her sister from a likely death. This games are a survival tournament between the 12 different districts that is held in the Capitol and features participants from the ages of 13 (?) to 18.  The main story: survival, is added to with the possibility of romance, audience manipulation and defiance against an oppressive regime. I loved it. I really loved it. The story arc is tightly wound and just goes up and up in its tension as the book progresses.  I found Suzanne Collins totally ruthless as an author (for this kind of book she needs to be) and that was overwhelmingly refreshing for me as a reader. No-one is spared. Friendships are made because of the need to survive and then characters are dispatched as if the Hunger Games was happening in reality right now. There's no sentimentality in this book or inauthentic moments and that's what makes the story work because it feels as if you're right there every step of the way with Katniss and the other competitors.  Also, the book ends. The Hunger Games end and that makes it a compelling (and fulfilling) read.  CHARACTERS  It's been a long time since I've read characters who I've cared about so deeply. I love Katniss and her strength, her confusion, her struggle with humanity versus survival. It's powerful, it's evocative and it made my heart jump more than once. She's a character that hasn't just turned up with a bow because that's what the author wants, she's a character who grew to use a bow because of her fierce determination to survive. I feel that things are going to go badly for her in the next two novels but you can't help but hope she makes it somehow.  There's a great mentor in Haymitch who I hope will be fleshed out more in the second book, a complex and volatile love interest in Peeta, an uncertain ally in Cinna and a fascinating interviewer in Caesar. I think what I loved about all these characters was the fact that they arrive as real people. They have histories, secrets and their own goals Suzanne hasn't told us about yet. Nothing feels deliberately hidden in the book but you can feel it lurking beneath the surface and just waiting to explode.  I think Cinna was probably my favourite outside of Katniss and I'm looking forward to seeing if he gets more space in the next novel.  WRITING  Wow. This is incredibly written. The end of the book says that Suzanne Collins explores the effects of war in her novels and you can feel that. She writes with a purpose and drive that I did not feel in Twilight or Switched. Everything feels stripped back, every word feels as if it should belong on the page and there's no fancy literary games to be played with the author. I felt as if Katniss was speaking to me directly all the way through.  It's written in the first person perspective and in the present tense. I think the narrator is a little unreliable (she's only 18) but has a unique and strong voice that you can hear in each sentence on the page. After reading the big ones: Switched and Twilight, I'm pretty comfortable saying this is in a whole different league. There was nothing wrong with Stephanie Meyer or Amanda Hocking's writing ability in those books, but they were not at this level. Not this gripping, not with this strength of tone and force behind each word. It was like being kicked in the teeth and then pulled behind a chariot for three thousand metres.  CONCLUSION  Is it worth five dollars? Yes. Hell yes.  I can't tell you how much of a relief it was for me to read Hunger Games. I really struggled through the last two books and thought that maybe I had lost my ability to enjoy well written novels because I was writing more myself. I wasn't. The last two books just weren't that good.  Hunger Games grabbed me from the first page and held me until its bittersweet end. I started it at ten o'clock at night and finished the novel the next morning. It's about 80,000 words but it didn't feel like it. It felt so much smaller than the other two novels I had just read. I loved Hunger Games and it made me believe that there was some more Young Adult fiction out there for me.  You don't need to like YA to enjoy Hunger Games, you don't need to like vampires, love torn women or any of the tropes of the genre. This is fiction at its finest with an immediacy that would have made George Orwell proud.  --------------  Disagree? Think it's not that great? Believe I'm being too kind? Too harsh?

I first heard about Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games on a flight between Philly and Birmingham last Christmas. A young woman, late twenties early thirties, was reading it and her seatmate asked her about it. One of the best books she ever read, she enthused and went on to talk about the story. I don't usually read popular fiction but I could tell this woman was intelligent and I thought, "I'll look into that when my reading list goes down a bit."  Kindle had a sale on the first volume shortly after the movie came out and broke box office records. I thought I'd start it and if it was corny or awful, set it aside. It took me about ten days to read all three volumes, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, The Mockingjay. The last time I was this involved in works of fiction was Richard Stark's final three Parker novels, and The Hunger Games blew those out of the water.  I suppose it's partly that Katniss Everdeen revives the Diana archtype. The way the character balances courage and ruthlessness, with loyalty and loving kindness made my heart surge repeatedly through all of these volumes. The term "modern classic" is trite but I'm here to tell you these books will be read by your great grandchildren. I could compare them to 1984 and The Count of Monte Cristo, even Treasure Island, but these are not just rollicking good tales or cautionary warnings. Collins makes her readers consider what is "right" and what is necessary. Suicide and revenge are recurring themes in these books and no character is exactly what they seem to be. Inconsistencies and weaknesses bring a level of reality to these books rare in science or dystopian fiction. Most novels are either character driven or plot driven. The Hunger Games trilogy is both, a powerful plot inhabited by unforgettable passionate characters. If you haven't read them, I envy you encountering them for the first time. A word to the wise, get all three volumes up front. You will not want to stop until you learn what happens.
I have to admit that I jumped on the band wagon because I love it when books are made into movies. More often than not the book is better than the movie because of the details lost in trying to keep the movie to two hours or so. However, there are times when all the stars are aligned and the movie is equally good if not better than the book. Making books into movies is also and honor and secretly you always hope that the viewer will become a reader of the book/series. SOOO I was rooting for the movie and the series having not yet read the series yet with all the intentions in the world of reading the series prior to the movie coming out. Mission accomplished. :-)  With that said I was a little disappointed because I just wasn't understanding all of the hype with this first book. Mind you, I turned my son and niece onto the series and they were RAVING about this first book. I kept telling them "Guys, I don't yet get the big deal". I felt that the beginning was slow. I had a hard time understanding/believing this wonderful relationship that developed between Katniss and Cinna. I didn't think they spent enough time with one another to develop this closeness out of all the people who surrounded her.  I think everything was simply written and eventually its simplicity is what won me over. I started to like the book when the games began. The author's ability to describe the feelings that Katniss felt as a tribute, the anxiety, the hunger, the panic, the desperate agonizing need to survive was amazing. You honestly felt all those feelings right along with Katniss and it was so clear. One of my pet peeves is when an author over explains scenes or gives to many details during battle scenes and ends up making a jumbled mess of it. Suzanne Collins definitely did not have this problem. I was a goner when Katniss teamed up with Rue. Katniss had been a bit a standoffish until then and she really was tender with Rue. So yeah going back to being a goner with the Katniss/Rue alliance... I cried like a baby and could not stop. That entire scene in the book was just incredible on so many levels. I could literally hear the song being sung and had already identified the melody and everything...I guess that's the singer in me.  By the end of The Hunger Games I was definitely a happier person in that I confidently could say I liked the book obviously with reservations but I could honestly say I did. In the end what won me over was the realness I felt in the third part of the book. What won me over was that this author was able to make me FEEL.  One other thing I want to mention is that the author did a great job with character development. Each and every character was consistent in their behavior. You could expect them to do or say what they did or said without thinking that was out of character. I don't mean that they were predictable because this is not the case but more that they were who they were, no questions. Another positive-Growth! Loved reading how some of these characters stepped up. :-)  I definitely think this is a book people should read. It can be gory/violent but think of the plot and what these children have been forced to do. It's meant to be violent. This book is meant to shock the reader. It forces you to contemplate a world not too far off if we don't change some of the things happening present day.
With over seven thousand reviews and counting, it seems almost redundant to write about the Hunger Games. Yet since everyone in the world seems to be talking about this book, I guess it's time to fall in line and add my two cents. By now it's pretty well documented that Suzanne Collins got the idea for "The Hunger Games" late one late when channel flicking, finding that clips from reality television and news footage of the war in Iraq were blurring in her mind. From there, the concept of the Hunger Games was born: a competition in which twenty-four young people are trapped inside an arena with weapons, tools, and a single objective: to kill each other until only one remains. Glory and wealth awaits this sole survivor.  It's a gripping idea, but it needs context. Thus Collins has devised a dystopian future in which a wealthy, decadent city known as the Capitol maintains totalitarian control over twelve districts that produce food, energy, coal and other raw materials for it. As a way of reminding the population that it is in complete control, the Capitol randomly selects two tributes (a boy and a girl) from each district every year and forces them to partake in the Hunger Games, which are then broadcast live to Capitol and districts alike. Whilst the districts watch their children die, the people of the Capitol view it all as extreme entertainment, and can bet on the winners, sponsor their favorites, and send supplies into the arena to give their contestants an edge.  Next come the characters to go with such a winning premise and setting. Katniss Everdeen is the book's protagonist, a seventeen year old girl from Distinct 12. With her father killed in a mining accident and her mother still grief-stricken over his death, Katniss is the breadwinner of the household. She frequently goes poaching in the nearby woods with her friend Gale, all in order to provide for her little sister Primrose.  But at that year's reaping Prim's name is pulled out of the lottery, and it doesn't take a genius to release that Katniss will volunteer to play in her place. She and her companion Peeta Mallark, the baker's boy, are whisked off to the Capitol to be fed, groomed, styled, interviewed, trained and eventually escorted into the arena. But Katniss and Peeta utilize a unique strategy to give them an edge: to increase their popularity and gain more sponsors, the two of them pretend to be deeply in love. Naturally this performance masks what may or may not be truer feelings between them, an added level of complexity to a scenario in which everyone's first impulse is basic survival.  Between these three components, it's no wonder that "The Hunger Games" is a bestseller. If there's one thing that any reader would be hard-pressed to deny, it's the book's near-perfect pacing. There is not a dull moment from start to finish, not a word wasted or a paragraph padded. Never before have I been so unconscious of how quickly I turned pages, and I had completed the book and was ready to move onto the sequel in a matter of hours.  The idea of sporting matches in which the participants play for their lives is not exactly a new one. The entire plot is reminiscent of Battle Royale,The Running Man,Thunderdome,Spartacus, and of course, the reality TV show Survivor were that show actually *about* life-or-death survival and not middle-class Americans fending for themselves in the wilderness. To accuse Suzanne Collins of plagiarism is rather disingenuous considering the regularity with which this trope reoccurs in fiction, especially since it was the Romans who set the precedent, what with their gladiatorial arenas. Along with a nod to Greek mythology (twenty-four was the number of youths sent from Athens to Crete each year to be sacrificed to the Minotaur), Collins chose to call her world "Panem", an allusion to the phrase "panem et circenses" (or "bread and circuses") coined by the Roman satirist Juvenal in order to describe the aspirations of a population that are happy to give up civic responsibilities in exchange for basic needs and entertainment. Furthermore, dozens of Roman names are strewn throughout the novel (including Flavia, Cato, Portia and Seneca, among others) making it very clear where Collins drew her inspiration from.  Collins is restrained about divulging details concerning the post-apocalyptic world she's created. Though Panem is implied to be in North America, the state of the rest of the world remains a complete mystery, and details about the society, politics and technology of the future are disclosed to the reader on a need-to-know basis. Though Collins is scant on the world-building, this actually ends up working in the book's favor, as the reader isn't bogged down with needless detail on how everything came to be in this rather disquieting glimpse into our potential future.  Likewise, I was rather surprised at the on-line debates surrounding the love triangle between Gale/Katniss/Peeta - it was pretty clear to me that Katniss would have unhesitatingly forsaken them both in order to save her little sister, and the romantic entanglements (particularly in this book) barely constitute a subplot. Perhaps the focus on this aspect of the story was a side effect of the prominent endorsements from Stephenie Meyer splattered all over the covers and spines of the book. I gotta say, they're a little strange. As far as female protagonists so, Katniss is the polar opposite of Meyer's bland, whiny, co-dependent Bella, and every time I put the book aside and glimpsed Meyer's name, I couldn't help but laugh at the image of Bella in Katniss's environment. She wouldn't last twelve seconds, and the only thing that the two books have even *remotely* in common is that they're both told by the teenage protagonist in first-person narration. Collins really excels in bringing Katniss to life: she's stoic, determined, relentless, uncompromising, and more than a little clueless when it comes to emotions and relationships.  As such, the book is made up of short, fragmented sentences that get the point across and no more. Katniss isn't one to wax lyrical about the sunset or the wind in the trees or her boyfriend's "tousled hair and crooked smile" - she's got more important stuff to concentrate on, and the writing style conveys this throughout the story.  Though "The Hunger Games" is a riveting read, there are a couple of flaws in this first installment that bear pointing out, namely that Collins raises some sticky moral dilemmas, but never really explores them. It's convenient, for example, that Katniss's kills in the arena are all self-defense and that she's never required to kill a fellow combatant in cold blood (not yet anyway). Likewise, there are a couple of deaths that are blatantly manipulative. Still, these shortcomings count for little when the power of the pacing and the nail-biting tension of the plot sweep you up into the story. It's an addictive rollercoaster ride, and you're going to want to have the sequel Catching Fire on hand directly afterwards.
Oh Katniss, how I love thee!  What is up with the controversy around how she lacks agency within the context of the Hunger Games?  Exactly how does one define agency?  If one was to define agency in a very simplistic way - - as "being the aggressor", then ok, she lacks agency.  If one was to think of agency as actually developing a plan and using your brains to survive, then she really, isn't she actively participating in the Games?  I find it ironic that this argument about Katniss lacking agency is emerging from feminists (this, coming from a feminist), because the criticism is based on the concept of "agency" from a masculine perspective (agency = aggression). I've also recently read the argument that Katniss is a strong feminist character because it's ultimately her use of feminine characteristics (i.e., nurturing, bonding with other female characters, etc.) that saves her.  Right, she didn't play up her "relationship" with Peeta to get food, medicine, etc.  She didn't twirl in her fire dress to get sponsors...  Hmmm...  Regardless of whether Katniss is a feminist or anti-feminist (I like to think of her as a girl thrown into despicable circumstances), I think we can all agree on one thing...she's not Bella.  The Hunger Games is a fantastic book for a number of reasons:  strong characters, great plot, and solid writing.  Ok, the story itself reminded me of the Running Man but because we are actually in the thick of "reality TV" obsession and because there are children involved (and I'm a parent), it was that much more interesting, albeit disturbing.  Really though, at the end of the day, Suzanne Collins is a brilliant writer.  It's the writing that carries this book.  I haven't read the next two yet (they're on the ever-growing list!) but I'm hoping they will be just as good.
I will begin by saying that I don't agree with the people who think that this book's material is too graphic or disturbing for teens. Yes, the concept itself is disturbing. Yes, The Hunger Games contains some moderately graphic violence. The fact of the matter is that books that lull you into a sense of complacency don't make an impact on anyone. I can really only speak for myself, but at thirteen years old I definitely wouldn't have lost any sleep over this story.  At eighteen years old, I'm wondering why I wasted my time. The Hunger Games isn't the WORST book I've ever read, but the hype strikes me as rather bizarre. I feel as though the Emperor is naked, so to speak.  As I began to read, the first thing that struck me was how very dull and stilted Katniss's narrative voice is. The writing, while certainly not the trainwreck that was Twilight, is cliched, trite, and shallow, a chop suey of the ideas of more talented writers at best. The prose does its job but nothing special can be said of it. I understand that Katniss, coming from a poor district, isn't likely to be the most eloquent girl, but Suzanne Collins might've done better to write this in third person.  Katniss herself is another huge problem. There is absolutely nothing interesting about her, no particularly special quality about her that makes me actually care about her as a person. So she is resourceful and can hunt. So she has a temper. You could say the same of a wild chimpanzee. I suspect her relationship with her little sister Primrose was meant to accomplish the goal of making her into a sympathetic character, but all it did was convince me that Mrs. Collins has never had a sibling. Just for the record, I have an older sister who would've been about Katniss's age when I was Prim's. We are very close, more so than most siblings I've met, and we're still nothing like the sickeningly sweet display that apparently was supposed to inspire sympathy. The protagonist's relationships with other major characters aren't any improvement; I read every last page and I still don't understand Peeta's borderline-suicidal devotion to a girl with all the personality of a wet piece of tissue.  Out of common decency I won't spoil the plot, but quite honestly, I don't need to. Deus ex machinas abound; every time it seems like Katniss is about to be faced with a weighty moral dilemma, along comes an entirely expected plot "twist" to conveniently remove that responsibility from her. For supposedly being about a brutal fight to the death, the book sure does pussyfoot around when it comes to inflicting any psychological anguish upon the protagonist. The mentality here is a very black-and-white one: poor good, rich bad, government worse. The violent and quick-paced action itself is quite honestly the only thing that makes The Hunger Games remotely tolerable. It's been said before but I'll say it again: this is basically Battle Royale for sissies.  I give this book two stars because it fulfills the minimum requirement of being entertaining. It'd be difficult, after all, to make a story about children murdering each other BORING. But those of you who are looking for immersion and for characters who truly tug at your heartstrings, look elsewhere. The Hunger Games will leave you hungry, and not for more of Suzanne Collins' work.
I instantly fell in love with Katniss.  She is strong willed but yet deep down is very unsure of herself and her surroundings.  She has so much love for her sister that she would do anything for her including sacrifice her life in the Hunger Games so that her sister doesn't have to go.  When that happened in the book I couldn't believe it.  No one would do that for their family during this time.  I mean that is practically committing  suicide.  The game is that 24 go into the area and only 1 comes out.  Not the best odds in the world....not even the best odds period!  Katniss was sent to the Capital, along with Peeta; the boy tribute from District 12, to get ready for the Hunger Games.  They need to attract sponsors and make the people love them.  During this time you find out that there is more than meets the eye with Peeta and Katniss.  Peeta loves Katniss and she doesn't know it.  How amazing is that!  A love story in the mist of death.  This is why I love dystopians so much.  Some love the swoon that other books bring to the table, but these books do the same thing but just with something a little extra!  After some kissing and major twist at the end of the book it really sucks you in.  You just can't get enough of the Hunger Games.  You want more, and you will get it.  :)  The whole book and story between Katniss and Peeta was amazing!  You truly fell in love with both characters.  And you seriously fall madly in love with their heroism.  You wanted them to survive for each other.  You wanted both of them to make it. You want them to be together.  I can not wait to read Catching Fire.  I have to know what happens next.  Do they stay together? Do they make it work?  DON'T TELL ME!!!  I will read it.
I'm pretty late to the party with this one. In fact, I'd had no plans to read it at all, because I don't particularly care for young adult literature. I'm an adult, and I prefer to read books that are targeted toward me. But I saw this on sale cheap, so I picked it up.  I thought the author's writing made everything extremely vivid. I had a good mental image of District 12, and Katniss's family. I cared about her, and her friends, right away. I did find the tense a little bit distracting, though. The present tense can be very powerful when done right, but the only instance I've ever seen in which it strengthened the novel rather than distracted from it would be The Handmaid's Tale. In this case, I really think it was a mistake to not write this book in past tense.  I liked Katniss. She's clever, but still has some of a sixteen-year-old's emotional naivete. She has a temper, and I like that because it's something I completely relate to myself. I liked Peeta instantly. I kept wanting to hear more from him. I felt she was deluding herself all along that he was trying to manipulate her when it was incredibly obvious he was exactly what he appeared to be: a very nice boy. But given the situation they were in, her misgivings were completely understandable.  I raced through the entire second half of this book with a sense of dread, sure that I would find the ending upsetting but unable to stop myself, because I CARED about these characters. I did predict a plot twist that happened very near the end, because I realized that plot twist was necessary in order for it to be a decent story. I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't go into further detail on it. Although I was able to predict it, I would have been disappointed in the book if it hadn't done it. The conflict it added was necessary, and I was glad to see how Katniss was able to overcome it.  I'll definitely be picking up the next book as soon as I can. I have to find out what happens next.
I hadn't paid any attention to `The Hunger Games' book(s) until I inadvertently saw the film a week or two ago. I watched the movie and rated it highly so I grabbed a copy of the book.  I'm not going to bother writing a synopsis of the book, as a plethora of people have already done that. Furthermore, I'm not going to say that it ganked* concepts from this author or from that East Asian idea. What I will say though, is that Suzanne Collins has done a stellar job writing a kind of `Fisher Price - My First Dystopia' novel that is emotive, honest, and memorable. And considering the concept, it's not very graphic.  The book is effortless to read. The chapters are fairly short, and the pages seem to turn by themselves. Towards the end of the book I was hoping for more pages to magically appear. Not since the classic Aussie war dystopia, `Tomorrow, When the War Began', has young adult fiction been so enjoyable to read and easy to crush through. I would even recommend this book as a good one for ESL kids who have an intermediate-plus grasp of English.  `The Hunger Games' novel is better than the movie for a variety of reasons. First of all, there is a much deeper insight into the way Katniss thinks and feels - especially in regards to how she feels about the boys in her life. Secondly, the friendship and understanding between Katniss and Rue in the arena is stronger, more honest, and further developed. The movie does this part of the book no justice. Finally, the book has a lot more information about Peeta, as well as periphery characters that don't get screen time in the film.  I watched the movie again a few days ago to compare it with the book. Needless to say it was wanting in many areas. If you rate the movie a paltry 6.5 out of 10 - you should still read this. However, if you enjoyed the motion picture, then this book is required reading.  * Stole
I followed an usual path to reading, "The Hunger Games" instead of reading the book and then watching the movie... I did the opposite and watched the movie first. Despite being a little too violent for my tastes (at least for movies) I thought its was a very interesting twist on stories like Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery". I decided that it might be fun to go ahead and read the trilogy.  The biggest complaint that I heard about Suzanne Collins' writing, was her writing. People complain that the dialogue is overly contrived and that the writing lacked sophistication - violence was used as a substitute for character development... and such. After reading "Hunger Games" I find most of the criticism off-the-mark. While no one will confuse the writing in "Hunger Games" as a literary masterpiece - it certainly is better than some of the other books in this genre. It may be an unfair comparison but to me it reminded me of some of the works of Jules Verne (but with less foreshadowing and other literary devices).  A few other notes  - The book (except for maybe 5 pages at the end) seemed less violent and graphic than the movie  - Probably appropriate for children 11 and up... since their are some scary imagery - and the concept (kids hunting and killing kids) is certainly adult. I would highly recommend that parents read the story PRIOR to their kids.  - No foul language  - Lots of references to being naked... which is a bit odd for YA novels- nothing sexual or even remotely explicit, but still a bit odd.  - Very fast paced - the type of book that you will finish in less than a week.  Final Verdict - "Hunger Games" is a fast-paced novel that will immediately engulf you into the anti-utopian future of North America. While the writing may not be world class it is good enough not to be a distraction. I would highly recommend it for a fun fast paced read - but parents - you may want to read it before your kids.  5 Stars
Okay let me get this out of the way right now.  Yes I saw the movie first.  There, I said it.  Seeing the movie made me want to read the book and find out if the source material was as good as the movie was.  I got a co-worker to loan this book to me and I'm extremely glad I did!  I want to compare the movie and the book in this review, so if you haven't seen the movie yet you may want to stop reading.  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  What I really liked about the movie is how well it showed that even though this was the future and we have all this amazing technology, it is only available to the very rich and the people in power.  The rest of society lives in poverty and is barely scraping by.  What I liked about the book most of all is how it really emphasizes how the lower classes really are STARVING.  They are forced to break the law by going outside the fences and gathering food illegally just to survive.  And I mean literally survive.  If Kat didn't go foraging and hunting her sister and her mother would literally starve to death.  The book shows that every once in a while the Peace Keepers (their version of the police) would come and pick up a body of someone who had starved to death.  Also what's good about the book is it really delves into Kat's past, it expanded on the bread throwing scene in the movie.  What had happened, why Kat was out in the rain that day and what prompted Peeta to throw the bread to her.  In the movie it's barely touched on other than one flash back and a quick discussion of it.  The book also really shows you what had happened to Kat's father, her relationship with him and how hard her mother took it when he died and how it really was Kat who got Prim and her mother through the dark times and put food on the table.  The only thing I kinda raised my eyebrow at and wondered about was the fact that Kat was surprised at all the technology that the Capital had and how she stated it all seemed alien to her, yet she was able to operate the shower, food maker machine and all the other devices without any problems at all.  However that minor complaint is quickly forgotten once the games start and tributes are thrown together!  Unlike the movie, the book just focuses on Kat during the games, we don't cut to Haymitch or the Game-makers during the games or to any of the people in the other districts and their reactions, it's just Kat and her interactions with the other tributes.  Which was pretty cool and kept the focus on the action.  The only part about the games that I didn't like was that they said that the mutated dogs at the end that hunted down the last remaining tributes were made from the bodies of the dead tributes that had been killed earlier.  You mean to tell me that in this alternate future we can bring bodies back from the dead and mutate them into a completely different species?  That's kinda a stretch even if we are like 80 years in the future.  Hell our law makers are STILL arguing about cloning and that debate's been going on since the 90's so how can we move our bio-engineering along that far only 80 years in the future?  Oh well it's no biggie, I can suspend my disbelief for this book :-)  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  So that's it, I really liked this book!  It was really really good and I suggest it to anyone who loves futuristic fiction, science fiction or drama.  Also if you watched the movie you should check it out as well!  I will definitely be checking out the next book in the series and I'm sure I'll enjoy it just as much! :-)
First, let me say this is the first review I have ever written.  EVER.  But since lately I rely on other's reviews before buying just about anything, I thought I should share for the opportunity to some that may read it, how this book/series affected me.  For me, this is the first book that I have read in a long time that can balance on the fine line between being "deep" and trying so hard for depth that it's borderline ridiculous.  For the most part, I will enjoy a story but find it either very light and basic or the author is so desperate to create something "different" that it winds up not making sense.  (Should anyone be reading this and knows what I'm talking about, they are probably clicking to buy the book before even reading the rest of my review!)  What Collins has done in this book is the reason why I don't write-not many people can effectively achieve this.  Summaries of the book can be found everywhere, so I won't go too far into it, but there is a line in the book that sticks with me.  Peeta says he is trying to find a way to show them he is more than just a piece in one of their games. It seems both this book and from what I have read into the rest of the trilogy the main part of the story centers around this idea, for at least the main characters, anyway.  What I found the most interesting was everything the book left unsaid.  If you are "with" the auther on her ideas you are given enough information to form your own answers about what is really going on.  As Katniss is trying to figure out the reasoning for everything that happens to her and the world of Panem, the reader is also in need of figuring out her perspective and sometimes, a perspective that she doesn't see.  Suzanne Collins, I can 100% appreciate where you were going with this book, and I'm with you!  Now, if you are not able to pick up the message I have been talking about, you will still most likely enjoy the book very much, and not feel that you are missing out on anything.  As everyone seems to be saying, it is very well written with cliffhangers at the end of every chapter.  It keeps you moving forward and engaged.  Yes there is a bit of gore and there were a few times I was disappointed that the romance intensity did not pick up whatsoever, but I have to remember, the story is following the path the author has chosen, not what I would like to read.  So anything extra will just have to exist in my imagination!
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is an epic, action-packed story about strength and survival in the face of horrible circumstances. Katniss Everdeen is a survivor. Katniss takes care of her mother and her little sister, Prim after her father dies in a mining accident. She braves the dangers of the forest outside the safety of the fences to poach food for her family with the help of her best friend Gale. Times are tough, but it is The Reaping that strikes fear into the children of Panem and their families' hearts.  The Reaping is the day that one boy and one girl from each of the 12 districts will be chosen to fight in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a battle to the death between all 24 tributes, where only one is allowed to survive. When Prim's name is selected from the bowl of names, Katniss does the unthinkable, she volunteers.  Now she is about to fight for her life against extraordinary odds.  I know almost everyone has read The Hunger Games, and I am late to the game. After watching the movie trailers all over my TV, I knew I had to read the book before going to see the movie. I am beyond glad that I decided to pick up The Hunger Games after much urging from my husband. I love the inner strength and bravery Katniss shows just by supporting her family, and standing in to save her sister. The games are cruel and horrible; it is children killing other children for the enjoyment of the Capitol. Katniss manages not to let the cruelty of the games, and the horrific conditions change her into a monster.  Peeta, the other champion from District 12, or The Boy with Bread, is beyond sweet. I really love the relationship that Katniss and Peeta develop before The Hunger Games. For the ones who are like me and still have not read it, I will not spoil it. I just cannot wait to see what is going to happen in Catching Fire, and Mockingjay. If you have not had the chance to read The Hunger Games or you are not sure about it, pick it up because you will devour it. I should be going to see the movie this week, and I cannot wait!  **Unabridged Bookshelf purchased this book**
The plot has been described to death below, so I won't add to it. However, here are a few problems/questions I had concerning the book (which I found extremely exciting because I read almost all of it in one sitting, something I rarely do because I'm so slow):  --A map would have been nice. The only two physical locations we have are District 12's Appalachian setting and, probably, Denver as the Capital ("in the Rockies"). What part of the country was doomed District 13 in? Probably California, but who knows? Maybe the author had not worked this out in Volume I--but she should have.  --The author must have been a food critic in another life. The book is FULL of descriptions of food and feasts and survival meals. I grew a bit tired of it, but maybe nearly-starving people fantasize about food, which might explain the obsession.  --The heroine acts like she's 11 years old at times (throws hissy-fits and full-blown tantrums), 16 at other times (slightly coquettish, slightly bitchy, but not totally self-absorbed, which is pleasantly unusual for this age), and 35 during battle, demonstrating maturity and advanced survival skills in a fight to the death with much stronger opponents.  --What was with the delivery system for the "gifts" from sponsors (food, weapons, medicines, etc.)? Things float from the sky suspended by little parachutes and arrive at your feet--in the forest? Come on!  --I realize this book was written with teens as the audience (just as most movies are today), but by age 16 a girl has SOME idea about sex and sexuality--and some girls know just about all there is to know. The book completely ignores this aspect of the heroine's being, however. The same can be said for the guys, who in real life are total hornballs at this age, and sex would be almost as strong a motivator as survival with them.  Lest this nit-picky list (which could be much longer) sound too negative, let me repeat that I loved the book and would recommend it to anybody but a literary critic or a serious sci-fi fan. The author has a good eye for natural phenomena and often describes it beautifully. It's certainly worth the money ... and I plan to purchase the next two installments of the tale.
When my friend first reccommended this book to me and told me what it was about, I thought it sounded extremely violent &amp; uninteresting. I WAS WRONG!!! From page 1, I was hooked.  I read the entire book in one (4 and a half hour) sitting! I couldn't tear myself away from it.  First of all, Katniss Everdeen and her personality had me all over it in the beginning, during the character introductions.  I couldn't believe her circumstances!  I could partially infer what was going to happen at the Reaping, but I guessed wrong!  Suzanne Collins kept me on my toes-I was guessing, inferring, asking questions, and on the edge of my seat.  I couldn't believe that I'd found something that topped the Twilight Saga (my previously favorite series)!  The Hunger Games is an action/adventure, with a bit of romance here and there.  It's about Katniss Everdeen (sometime around the year 3000, or around that era) who's sister, Primrose (Prim) is chosen at the Reaping for the Hunger Games.  (The Reaping is when they pick 2 tributes, 1 boy and 1 girl, and for each extra time you put your name in, they give you 1 pound of some mush that's considered food.) Katniss volunteers, which nobody wants to do, considering it's 24 teens between the ages of 12-18, and they fight until the death, and the winner is the last one standing, who lives a life of luxury (or so it's called) for the rest of their existence.  Or do they?  The other tribute is Peeta Mellark, who had given Katniss a few loaves of bread when she was younger, right after her father died and she became the household food-gatherer (that's what I decided to call it)-as in she has to feed herself, her sister Prim, and her mother.  Will Katniss and Peeta form an alliance, or will it be every man for himself?  Will Katniss win, or will someone else be declared the champion?
I can finally say that I have left my rock and joined the "in-crowd." I finally read The Hunger Games. It's true that these books have been sitting on my shelves gathering dust for at least a year, maybe longer. I have no excuse to offer for why I haven't read these books until now. I knew they were great (I've heard it constantly). I've been threatened by my friends to read the books "or else"--but they always seems to forgive me. =) But, alas, I can finally say I have read them... and boy am I glad I did!  While I was talking with one my friends yesterday, I asked if she had read this series. She said no, but she had the books in her classroom. I snickered. (out loud) I told her I finally read these books and she needed to do it pronto. Then I explained why...  First, the characters. I loved how different Peeta and Katniss were. You truly get the sense that Peeta is a genuine "nice guy" that you can't help but like. He doesn't seem weak or annoying. In fact, he warms my heart and made me smile. Katniss, on the other hand, is a little rough around the edges. She's not unlikeable by any means. I really liked her. I am a sucker for books with strong female characters! (Not the typical whiny, boy crazy, hormonal nightmares that you normally read about.) The relationship between Prim and Katniss captivated me. For someone to volunteer for such horror to protect another... wow. Oh, and then there was Haymitch. Heh. He was grouchy, ornery, and an absolute riot. Maybe I wasn't supposed to like him as much as I did, but I couldn't help it.  I don't think there is much to say about this book since just about everyone I know has read it already. I can only offer my insights into the book that has been given so much hype. I was fascinated by the games. Since there are three books, I already knew how the games would eventually end. That wasn't a surprise, which I think took away from my experience. Somehow knowing that the two main characters survive took part of the thrill away. Of course, there were a few surprising twists to keep it interesting until the end.  I think it's safe to say I am pleased that I finally read this book. Did it get a 5 star rating from me? No, and that's probably because I knew too much about the book going in. This is a solid 4 (maybe a 4.5?), however. I devoured it in a day and instantly started on the second book. I can't wait to see the movie now and see how the unique characters and settings are brought to life.
There are several reasons I resisted reading this series up til now. I generally avoid books that have generated a lot of hype as I find my tastes to be somewhat different from those of the "mainstream" crowd. Also the fact that Stephanie Meyer was listed right next to Stephen King in the celebrity reviews, somewhat turned me off on the book. Even my neice's enthusiastic appreciation  of the book did little to overcome my initial resistance. But when I finally gave in so far as to read the first few pages of it with the "Look Inside" feature offered by Amazon, I was hooked. I read as much as it would let me then immediately ordered it in paperback. I waited impatiently for it all week, wishing I had just bought the kindle version so I could be reading it NOW!  When it finally arrived it was all I could do to hold off a few hours and get the rest of my day done with before sitting down and picking up right where I had left off. I read for hours that night and got nearly halfway through. I could hardly sleep for wondering what would come next. I picked it up again first thing with my morning coffee and simply could not stop reading all day. I kept telling myself, 'just one more chapter, then I'll stop and do something else for awhile'. But the story had me completely in its grip and before I knew it, it was afternoon and I had finished it. Rarely has a book held me so enthralled. I am an avid Harry Potter fan and the first to admit that I read most of the books as soon as they came out and finished in a matter of days. This blows all of them out of the water. I have never finished a book so quickly, nor been left so 'hungry' for the next in the series. I can't wait to find out what happens next and am only annoyed that I will have to wait til the next paycheck to order book two.  Don't miss this book! It is a rare gem of a read and a unique treat for the literary senses. No other story can compare in terms of grit, heart and perfectly choreographed action, all told through the use of exemplary narrative style without the slightest hint of pretentiousness. At the very least, give the first few pages a read with the Look Inside feature and see what you think. It'll hook you in a two paragraphs flat!
Summary: NO SPOLIERS!  Our story is set in the future when the US has perished and has been replaced with twelve districts that are run by the Capitol(government system). Every year, two candidates or tributes are chosen from each district to take part in the Hunger Games. The tributes are taken to the Capitol to prepare and are then put into an arena of some sort. It can vary from a stretch of grassland to a desert to a frozen wasteland. The name of the game is to kill everyone else and be the last one standing. The Games are broadcasted and the Gamemakers can manipulate the weather or conjure up a "natural disaster" to make things more interesting for the viewers.  Review:  I had absolutely no problem getting into this book. I first got a sample and ordered the entire book immediately. I devoured this book but had a few problems with the writing style. Thus the 4 stars. The author's style of writing was getting a little annoying. There are many fragments and it seems to be written more as thoughts than as a literary structure. Later in the book I either got used to it or decided to ignore it all together because it was getting really juicy as there was 5% of the book left and the plot was only intensifying.  One other problem I had was that I believe it is very important that main characters be well liked. Katniss comes across as very selfish and can do no wrong. Everyone else may be wrong, but never her. She even seems to heavily criticize those to whom she owes a great deal.  Apart from those two things, I got through the book in no time. It left a strange impression on me. It scared me. I was terrified of what these characters who seem to come alive on the pages are being put through by the vicious Capitol. Just when you think it can't get anymore twisted... you're proven wrong. The ending is so haunting that you just have to sit back and let is all turn over in your head. It's terrifying because humans are very capable of coming to this. Rome was proof and many more recent events as well. This book will whisper to you.
The Hunger Games is set in a future where the Earth has been rvised by environmental catastrophes. North America, the only area of focus in the book so we do not know if anyone anywhere else has survived, is broken up into thirteen districts and a Capital.  Each district is responsible for supplying the Capital with a different resource, district 12 mines coal, district 11 harvests food, and so on.  Those in the districts live poor hard lives with little to no food, poor housing, hard working conditions and no time for idle play. Those in the Capital lead extravagant lives filled with plenty of food, the luxury of fine clothes and insane, over the top appearances.  The Capital controls each district and punishes those that do not follow the law.  As a reminder of a botched uprising that took place 74 years ago the Capital holds every year a gladiator type battle to the death between a selected boy and girl from each district.  Just like the ancient Romans, the citizens living in the Capital view the games as a form of entertainment, they see nothing wrong with children murdering each other in an effort to survive.  The children are brought to the Capital, dressed up, put on show, and paraded around, then thrown into an arena with only the clothes provided them and the knowledge they have.  The games are televised across the districts and made mandatory to watch.  The Hunger games follows the story of Katniss Everdeen and her battle to survive.  Unlike some of the other contenders, Katniss has the ability to hunt, something she learned from her father who died when she was a young child.  Because she was forced to provided for her remaining mother and younger sister, Katniss knows how to live off the land.  Little does she know that her actions will affect a future rebellion to which she becomes the face,
It's scenarios like this that make one believe in the worst and best of human behaviors.  In the not too distant future there is no more America.  After an era of peace and prosperity America becomes a post apocalyptic country called Panem.  Panem is separated into 12 districts and a capitol.  Actually there were 13 districts (reminiscent of the 13 original colonies perhaps?).  The 13th district tried to uprise against the Capitol holding its people in check and they were summarily obliterated.  This resulted in the Hunger Games.  Ever year, each district's children, once they hit age 12, are involved in a drawing.  One boy, one girl.  What happens if their names are drawn?  They're forced to fight to the death in an Arena of the Capitol's choosing.  All for the mandated viewing pleasure of the Panem populace.  The purpose?  To keep the population in a state of fear of course.  How better to quell uprisings and protect the Capitol's gilded comforts and riches against future revolts by showing the ultimate power: that of the life and death over each district's children every single year.  The Capitol rules with an iron fist, using Peacekeepers to keep each district's people inside their barbed wire prisons.  Starvation and sickness are rampant in each district, all while the people of the Capitol eat the best foods, drive around in cars, have immeasurable technology.  Enter Katniss.  Teenager from District 12.  When her 12 year old sister's name is chosen during the 'reaping' (when the children are chosen to represent during the Hunger Games) Katniss does the unthinkable.  She volunteers to go in her sister's stead.  This book is similar to so many things.  Part Running Man, part Logan's run, part Roman Empire with the brutal exploits of slaves in the colosseum for the edification of the powerful and to keep the lower classes in check by distracting them with voilence..and the threat of violence towards them if they should get uppity...it's really very simple.  The means of controlling a population by keeping them in a state of fear..as well as a statement that no matter how advanced a society, if it bleeds it leads...  Filled with great characters, great dialogue and a rapid fire page turning pace, this is really a great read.  Part sci fi, part character drama, the characters jump off the page and you can't help but get attached to some of them.  Can't recommend highly enough! I'm going to start Catching Fire ASAP.
I'm standing in the park on Christmas Eve, finishing the last dollups of words on my iPhone as my wife and son play on the nearby playset. My wife is quite content to be watching our boy while I read, because she knows what I'm experiencing. I'm floating through the last of "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins. It was my wife, after all, that insisted I read this book - a tactic she never deploys. There is a mutual understanding that the moment that one insists one reads a book, then one is skeptical. And skeptical I am. Already, no less than four people have insisted I read this book. Memories of Harry Potter begin floating in my mind and as I recall the fifth book was out before I bregudgingly read the first - then of course, I was hooked and caught up within three months.  Not exactly wanting a repeat of those dark ages of being without Harry Potter while the rest of the world lived so blissfully with their secret, I sense that this time - perhaps The Hunger Games is something I should pay attention to. Before the movie comes out and before Suzanne Collins becomes a household name (although I may already be too late for that).  And as I finish the last words of Collins' book, I'm left with only one question:  "How quickly can I download the next one onto my iPhone . . ."  But, of course, with Apple's new and stricter app ecommerce restrictions, I cannot simply "buy" and "download" from my Kindle app, so I'm left with no recourse but to open my iPhone's browser, navigate to Amazon's website, login by clumsily punching in my password and then search for the next book. Fortunately, I have one-click purchase set up and the deed is done.  I'm three chapters in before my wife realized I'd finished the first book.  Collins has done what many authors aspire to. Her Odyssey so transforms the universal consciousness of readers that rabid zealots are born in the midsts of her storytelling. The outlandish environment of her characters are made so completely believable by the third dimensional depth of the characters themselves that one has no question, not one, of their literal and tragic existence. The mind of Katniss is mine and by the time I'm left to hunger for more, I feel as if a part of me is now gone. I need Collins' words in order to feel complete and whole again. Such is the affect of so thoroughly living with another person's thoughts. It is hard to reconcile that she and this world are not real. So I begin transposing her world onto mine. And I wonder, as I walk the park with my family and reluctnatly set aside my iPhone, just how long will I have before the Capitol pulls my name and sends me to the arena.  And I count myself lucky that it has not yet happened.
I couldn't put this down the minute i started reading it. Mind it that i see tons of reviews about young teens being emotionally scarred from this book. I'm a 14 year old girl and have never had a nightmare or thought about the deaths in a scary way.  The book brings you into this different world of starvation, sorrow, and death, in a place called District 12. Hunting is the only way most of the people of the Seam make it through the day. Which is punishable by death.  The book was surprisingly cute. I mean, who doesn't want a guy like Peeta Mellark, the boy who gave Katniss Everdeen bread, to be theirs? Especially when he declares his love for her on live television before the games. Through so much death, and devastation, they * SPOILER ALERT* find a way to win the games and go back home. The only thing that annoyed me a bit was the ending.  In my opinion, I never really liked Gale all that much. He was too much fire for Katniss. So when she said she * SPOILER ALERT AGAIN* couldn't understand her feelings for either of them, which caused Peeta to become heartbroken. Leaving Katniss even more confused.  I've read the trilogy in a matter of days, but i wont say anything else. Too many spoilers already. This book was one of the most talked about books the last two years at my school. Now, that the movie is coming out, everyone is re-reading them for like the hundredth time.  Overall, this book is one of my favorites of all time. The lasting love in the middle of a battle and beginning of a rebellion is perfect because i wouldn't read just an action book. But i cannot stand romance novels.  If anyone has actually had the time to read this review, thank you so much. To Suzanne Collins, thank you so much for creating the hunger games, without this, i would probably still be reading vampire novels. This has opened my mind to different types of fiction and i am great full for that!(:
I will be the first to admit that I am hard on books, especially when they have high ratings and the main topic of conversation amongst my friends is how much I will love it. For the first hundred and fifty pages I was bored senseless and even put the book down a couple of times only to hear my daughter go on and on about how much she loved it.  Ok, except for mushy-gushy girl books, we usually agree so once again I picked up the book and plodded on.  Well heck, this book got good very quickly. Once the Hunger Games themselves started, the storyline and the characters mesmerized me to the point that I finished the last 200 pages in one sitting.  Katniss Everdeen has not had it any harder than the others children from her area, but when her younger sister is called during the reaping, she know that she must step in and take her place. She does not think that she can win the games, but she knows for sure that she does not want her sister to die. With Peeta, a boy from her area, they take on the Hunger Games.  Throughout the book, Katniss has to keep reminding herself that there can only be one winner in these games. Games that take place in an area that was once known as North American and is now split up in districts that send young teens to a battle ground to fight to the death to bring honor back to their people and their district. All the while being broadcast in full gory detail back to the audience that is betting on who will win.  "He is luring you in to make you easy prey. The more likable he is the more deadly he is."  The rules of the game state that there can only be one winner. From the first salvos to the last cannon shot, the combatants must form allies and know that at the end all but one of them will die. That is until there is a game changing moment and you wonder if the rules of the heart and the rules of the game can coincide.  This is only the first in a trilogy and I hope that they next book can keep up the lightning pace and note that this one ended on.
I admit I was skeptical of reading The Hunger Games. I heard they were Young Adult (YA) books, children's books, teen books, etc. It kind of turned me off from reading it.  I started a chapter here or there, then put it down for a few months because I was so busy with life.  Then I picked it up one night after I saw the movie trailer for The Hunger Games--Holy crap.  Now I HAD to read the books because the trailer convinced me it looked good! (Yes...I'm that shallow).  So I pick up my Kindle Touch 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 6" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers &amp; Sponsored Screensavers and begin reading.  O-M-G.  I LOVED IT.  I couldn't stop reading! I read it in 3 or 4 days, and that's including a VERY busy work schedule!  Just the names that the author used in The Hunger Games were so unique.  Peeta. Prim. Katniss. Gale. Rue.  They're fun names--easy to remember and unique enough to stand out.  The way the author created her world was handled very well. The book is VERY well written for a YA novel.  I'm a picky reader and I was impressed.  I also love how the author doesn't give us a year (at least I don't remember one) to go by for the Dystopian world, and leaves it to our imagination.  I pictured Capitol as the only futuristic city left in "Panem," and someone else I talked to said they pictured it as an upscale downtown metropolitan area.  So the world is described well, but still leaves room for plenty of imagination.  I devoured this book. It's has so much substance and uniqueness. There are some brutal and sad scenes--and kissing--won't spoil anything...so I would recommend this for kids 12 and up. This would be at least PG-13 in theaters.  Definitely give The Hunger Games a chance! It's a Dystopian sci-fi adventure!  Note for Kindle Edition:  1) Great format--it's perfect!  2) Includes page numbers &amp; location.  3) Table of Contents included.  4) No errors (I could not find any or notice any).
In essence this is a post-apocalyptic fictional book about a three teenagers.  This is the first book of the series and it sets up the premise of the other two books and is therefore essential to the story.  As the review says Katniss and Peeta, both 16, are sent to the "Hunger Games", a televised reality program of 24 12-18-year-olds fighting to the death until only one is left standing.  I could continue with a synposis of the story, but since this is a review I thought just to get to the heart of the matter.  This book for me was the weakest of the series, for a number of reasons, even though most of my friends who recommended this series felt this was the best. My prime reason was that in this book I just didn't like Katniss nor did any of the other characters catch my sympathy. Maybe since I dislike reality series shows that was the root of the problem, who knows.  I found Katniss to be just a little too shallow, a little too self-centered, and a little too judgmental, and many times I just wished she would die and let another character take her place. But it was those feelings that made me enjoy and appreciate the other two books as Katniss matures into a young woman any mother would be proud to call her own.  Because of the other two books I gave this 4/5 star review even though for me it was more of a 2 1/2 to 3 star book. I read at least 2 books a week, something that is remarkable considering how little extra time I have, but it took me over a week to read this one.  Many a time I would lay it down in disgust only to pick it up to see what happened next, to finish it to see if my friends were right that this was the best book.  So, my recommendation is that if you like post-apocalyptic books give this a whirl. In light of the other two this is a series well worth the read.
The Hunger Games was a very exciting book, and I really liked the fact that its a "young adult" classified book, but it can be enjoyable to any age group. Its a real action packed romance novel and my favorite thing about it is the way Collins describes the action scenes. This is what makes the book so entertaining and enjoyable to read. The story is in first person and follows Katniss Everdeen throughout the Hunger Games, which were not really games at all. Children ages twelve to eighteen were randomly chosen from each of the "districts" and were placed in an arena and forced to kill one another. It has a dark mood throughout the story and there is a lot of death and devastation. The fights are very bloody and exciting and Katniss, the main character, is often faced with death. In general, I would say that I really do like this book. Like I said, its very entertaining and an easy read. I would also say that I agree with the main theme of the Hunger Games. There is an oppressive government in control in the book, and Katniss has to outsmart the people who create the games (the game-makers) as well as the government to show the public just how cruel they are all treated. Specifically, as I mentioned before, my favorite thing about the book is the action scenes. They are described so perfectly and they are easy to imagine. This helps a great deal with people who can't focus on reading a book. It really grabs your attention and makes you want to read more and more. Collins did a wonderful job with this book and many people would agree with that. The Hunger Games trilogy has had a lot of success because of this. There isn't anything I would change or anything to improve about this book. I think it is a great book all around for studying or reading for fun.
The Hunger Games, an action and adventure novel, is a great read for teens. The main characters, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, are thrown into the annual Hunger Games of the dystopian world of Panem and forced to survive by killing fellow tributes.  The novel has a tense and dark tone. Since it is written in first-person, we see the events through Katniss's eyes. She is constantly feeling pressure to survive the Games. She is also saddened and scared of the Capitol's cruel actions and knows that there is little chance of surviving their wrath. The reader's mood throughout the novel is also tense and dark. A reader would be constantly worrying about Katniss and her welfare in the chaotic arena.  Overall, I liked the book because it tells a story of a normal, relatable girl who is thrust into the role of being a hero. Being sixteen, Katniss is the same, or a similar age, of the reader. She is still questioning her role in life and whether she will continue to be the main provider for her family once her world is turned upside down by the Hunger Games.  A major theme is the sacrifice for one's family and friends. Katniss shows the ultimate sacrifice when she sacrifices her life by volunteering in Prim's place as tribute in the Hunger Games. Sacrifice, no matter the price, is a good theme to in real life. It shows teens that they can use the act of sacrifice in their own lives.  I liked the Katniss's character progression in the book. Katniss began as a strong provider for her family. As her journey throughout the Hunger Games progressed, we saw her go from celebrity to potential rebellion-starter. She developed her strength as a fighter and showed Panem that she was not a force to be reckoned with.  Suzanne Collins did a great job relating Roman history to the novel. Most teens do not read for fun, much less want to learn through reading. Collins combines the best of both worlds by using history as a gateway for the incredible new world of Panem.  One change Collins could have made would have been to add more of a back-story to President Snow and his Capitol. Is he a dictator or a monarch? How long has he actually ruled Panem? These questions and more would have been a great addition to the story that might have explained more of a motive for how the Dark Days came about and its subsequent events.
I started the series because I was really interested in the movie. I always read books before they release it in theaters. But I heard many great things about the series from all my blogger friends, so a few weeks ago I bought the entire box set.  The Hunger Games surprised from the first few chapters. This world Collins has created was so creative that you can imagine this world of 13 districts.The writing was beautiful, it really got me into her novel and the world of the Districts. I couldn't put it down once the pace of the Capital came into view.  During the first part of the book, when they were picking the Tribunes, it was soo sad when out heroine Katniss sacrificed herself for her sister when Effie pulled out the name. This moment was presented perfectly and as the reader, it showed us how they were all chosen.  The setting was mainly taking place between District 12 and also in the district Panem, Collins described this as the future of The United States. The weapons and creatures in the books were the main items in which the weapons were to help support the Tribune. After reading the whole Games scene you can see that this is no ordinary world of the future, it was a death sentence.  I loved all of the characters in this book! Katniss Everdeen is one of the strongest characters I have ever read. She is stubborn, doesn't like following the rules, but she know how to survive in the wild. At the beginning you can really see that she is the provider in the family after her father passes away. Katniss hunts and uses the basic knowledge of survival to help her during the Games. Gale is her best friend at District 12, and he hunts with Katniss every Sunday. He is the other male character in her life. We dont get to know much about him in this book but I sense we shall see more of him soon!   Peeta Mellark..... how you are one sweet boy! He is the other Tribune to District 12. What I love about Peeta is his humor and how he interacts with with Katniss. He is the son of the baker, is not serious about the Games, but is willing to sacrifice his life to help save Katniss. He was one great character to read about. I was always looking forward to his parts in the book because you can see that he does harbor feelings so a special someone and he balances her and he does support her.  My journey of The Hunger Games was fantastic! Everyone needs to read this series, and it must be because everyone is talking about this book and the upcoming movie, which looks awesome. If you haven't read this series, you must start it, its worth it. Fast paced love, action, battle and when this romance is discovered, you will want to read the next one. Be sure to have the next two books next to you after you read this AMAZING series.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  '''''  Every year the Hunger Games are held and it was time for them to begin again. There are twelve districts and each district has to have a boy and a girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen entered into the games. The children are put into an arena and have a fight to the death. There can only be one survivor. The odds were high for Katniss and her friend Gale to get picked because it is done by a lottery system. Once you turn twelve your name went into it once each year and if you needed help with food for survival you could get some by entering your name more times. Katniss and Gale did this a lot. Even though the odds were high for them, Katniss's younger sister Prim who only had her name entered once, got picked. Katniss Volunteered to save her sister and with that decision began the fight for her life.  I finally sat down and read this book now that the movie is coming out in March. I had heard great things about it and had it highly recommended to me many times. I was not disappointed. I absolutely loved the story. The adventure was always exciting and I was continually wondering what would happen next, which kept me turning the pages.  The characters seemed very real and I found myself cheering for them.  This book had heart also. It wasn't just a cut-throat adventure, there was more to it. There was love, friendship and heart breaking moments. I was not only cheering for the main character Katniss. I wanted her to kick butt and win but I also couldn't help loving some of the other characters (i.e. Rue).  I've been completely drawn into this world and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  It is definitely a bit of a dark book considering twenty four children are having a fight to the death. This is the first time I have read about this kind of thing. I think part of the reason I waited so long to read this book is because of the subject matter. It was a hard thing to wrap my head around.
Hunger Games is probably one of my favorite books...ever. Yes, I sound like a teenager, but I don't care. Hunger Games is "my Twilight" (or at least that's how I explain it to my 13 year old niece.) I was told to read it maybe more than a year ago but didn't pick it up until this summer, when I first got my Kindle. It was my first book on there, followed by Catching Fire and Mockingjay, which I excitedly bought when I realized that with a Kindle I could do that now! I ate these books up, but not as much as the first one.  I think what originally hooked me is how like Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery" the beginning is, and growing up I adored the horrific nature of that short story. Naturally I enjoyed the horrific nature of this novel. Children fighting to the death against each other for entertainment? It's like if someone decided to make a tv show of "Baby Roman Gladiators" or something! And again, though I'd be horrified, I'd totally watch it.  When I first read Horror-- I mean Hunger Games, I loved about a million quotes but didn't know how to highlight on the Kindle yet, so I have no idea what they were now. Reading it a second time, I highlighted this interesting paragraph--  "Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and there's nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you."  Katniss says this as if the Capitol were saying this to the districts, taunting them. I LOVE this, because of the sheer horror of it. I've used the word horror a lot in this post, I know. But this truly paints a picture of our villains, and they are not to be trifled with.  I love the imagery of the book, the entire plot line, the improbability of it all...basically, if Hunger Games was a cake, I'd eat it.
Although I had heard much about The Hunger Games and was intrigued to read it, I must admit I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did, largely because I knew it was YA, which I don't normally read.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, though, and can see it becoming a classic dystopian novel. In fact, at times, the odd sentence here and there would remind me of A Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Overall, the entire concept of the book reminded me of The Running Man by Stephen King, but not in a derivative way.  The premise is simple; in the future, following some kind of war and rebellion, the United States cease to exist, and are replaced by twelve districts, each with its own responsibility to the Capitol, which is high in the Rockies. District 12 is the poorest of them all, and supplies the Capitol with coal.  That's where Katniss and Peeta come from. They are selected to represent their district in the annual Hunger Games, a fight-to-the-death in which a boy and a girl from each district, aged between 12 and 18, compete.  The characters are simply brilliant, though explicit description is rather sparse. They are all believable characters, who progress naturally in a very unforced way throughout the book, i.e. they don't suddenly become savage killers when the games begin, they progress naturally and become more ruthless as they become more desperate to survive.  Katniss is a wonderful character, truly three-dimensional, tough without being ruthless, naive in some things but very clever overall. She's one of the few likeable main characters I've come across in a long time, who isn't entirely flawless. She's very natural, and real, as are all the characters in the book.  Every single page is packed with suspense and tension.  Adult readers; please, do not let the fact that this novel is marketed for a young adult audience put you off. I made that mistake, and delayed reading it for quite some time (until I saw the trailer for the movie, in fact). It's a genuinely brilliant book, and I say that as an adult who didn't even read much YA fiction while I was in that age group.
This is one of the best books in modern times. The movie Gladiator comes to mind. If you have ever watched the TV shows Survivor or Big Brother this is for you. Actually this book is for everyone. It's Survivor to the death for kids 12 to 17. Brutal? Yes. But not as bas as it sounds.  It takes place in a future America. The US is now split up into districs. There are 12 districs, 13 was destroyed in the last civil war. Collins doesn't mention states, so I'm guessing the capitol is now in Colorado. "The Rockies" While Katniss is from the poorest, smallest district 12. Probably Kentucky, or West Virginia. Her town has coal miners and is in "Appalachia"  The evil Capitol, to keep control and dominate the districts stage Hunger Games. Games to remind the districts to never rebel again. Each district must send a girl and a boy to the games where they will fight each other to the death. Twenty four kids enter the arena, one survives and returns home where he will be nearly rich to live a life of luxury. The games are brutal and required viewing for all of the districs. The gamemasters, force the kids to fight each other with knives, spears, anything that will draw blood to keep audiences entertained.  Katniss, who has had a rough life, is forced into adulthood at 11 years old to provide for her family. She sneaks under the fence of District twelve to hunt game to sell, trade, and eat for her family's survival. Her Forte is hunting with a bow and arrow. Her rough life of struggling to even eat, may just her her a chance in the arena. Katniss while worldy smart, seems a little slow in the boyfriend area. Who can blame her though. With school and providing for her family, there isn't much time for boyfriends. Katniss is one of the strongest charecters ever and more importantly, she's a survivor.  This book is beautifully written and a work of art. I've never been able to hunt, yet when you watch Katniss hunt, you feel like your there also. It makes you want to learn to hunt. This book is also amazing written in first person. Your glued to the pages as Katniss thinks about whether she's on screen at times, and how to use that for her advantage.  This book should be a must read for everyone. It's entertainment at it's finest. Some readers might find it to dark. Or Brutal. Even in the beautiful hunting scenes, there is always a brutal undercurrent in your mind. It's not as bad as it seems though. The bloody scenes are small and your through them before you know it. One scene you will cry your eyeballs out. isn't this good thoguh? Writting so good that reaches to your heart. There is also some dark humor. Haymish a drunk, a scene remembering popcorn, and Katniss remembering a previous player who went insane in the arena. There is also a little romance in this book. Buy two copies of this book. Incase you wear the first one out.
I heard about this book since Stephanie Meyer recommended it back when The Twilight Saga was just starting out and I immediately checked out the synopsis to see if it was something I'd be interested in. After finding out it was some kind of "adventure" book I wasn't really into it. I'm more of a romantic novel kind of person, where the focus in on the two main characters falling in love, but after years of hearing nothing but good things about it, I decided to give into the masses and read it. I have to say, I don't regret it at all.  The action and suspense of the games really kept me going through this book and I finished it in no time. The beginning was kind of boring, which is usually the case in most books, but I love the intricate and details of the world that Suzanne Collins created and how the games are played out. Once it all got started, it was really hard to put the book down. The main character, Katniss, is definitely one you will adore, her love for her family and for people in general, makes you really care for the girl and hope for her survival through this inhumane and deadly game.  I really liked how, through the games, Katniss discovers so much about herself, like her survival skills and what is it that makes her so special. You also get to see the animalistic nature, dangerousness, and kindness of the other participants of The Hunger Games that leaves you rooting for some and hating others. The way The Capitol uses these children in this crazy and dangerous game of theirs is ridiculous! The whole book is definitely quite suspenseful and sometimes it even had me at the edge of my seat, dying to know what would happen next. There is even a dramatic, and very unique twist towards the end of the game that left me in shock (I really enjoyed that part, though the whole thing was just crazy, you wouldn't even consider that to come into play). You also see her battling with herself as she has to actually kill people in this game, even those she doesn't want to, like her friend Peeta, who came from the same district as her. It leaves you thinking about all that you would have to do to survive and what you would have to sacrifice in order to stay alive.  If you are looking for a good read, then I highly recommend grabbing this book. I definitely can't wait to read the next book, Catching Fire, in the series.
It is very difficult, most of the time, to separate ones reaction to the setting from ones reaction to the story and characters. However, I think my reactions to this book can be divided rather sharply into these two categories.  The setting is incredibly stupid. Even though the author kept it fairly surreal I was never able to suspend my disbelief well at all. I have seen much better settings utterly demolished in reviews, especially on the SF newsgroups on UseNet. District Twelve, give me a break. Neither the Capitol or the districts make any sense at all. Nor does the proposed society.  It is all just an excuse to create the terrible, beautiful and eventful story. And the story is all that. I was never bored. When I was not being irritated unto death by the setting I was being propelled along by the characters and what was happening to them.  Speaking of the characters, some of the minor characters are extremely fine. To echo A. E. Houseman, "With Rue my heart is laden." In fact that poem is appropriate when thinking of the young people, even the ones in whom the games brought out their worst natures, sactificed to this evil society.  When I just reviewed Michael Chabon's _Summerland_ (an even better juvenile) I mentioned the life lessons in the book. I think it is only fair to say that there are strong lessons in this book too. Lessons of loyalty and courage and also of not pre-judging people or at least not acting on those pre-judgments until you have a chance to see if they are wrong.  So I am giving the setting a one and the story a four. Which would average out to 2.5 but the story is more important.  I had expected some of the horrors of this setting to be redeemed in the sequel(s) Having read the first sequel, I think that is going to be true.
The Hunger Games  By: Suzanne Collins  (Given four stars for violence and a few other little things here and there.)   I knew the book was popular and apparently really good, but there are a lot of books that are supposedly really good.  When I walked into the library, I wasn't sure what I was looking for; then The Hunger Games came to mind.  And as I searched on the library website, every book copy was already checked out and/or was on hold multiple times by other people.  That's when I checked out a copy of The Hunger Games on audio book and it did not take me long at all to finish it.  As the story began, it soon drew me in and held me there.  Suzanne's way of writing is, in a way, straight to the point and doesn't need a lot of frills to make it exciting.  However, she executes her story in an entertaining way so it's not dry or lacking.  She does a magnificent job of continuing the plot along as she steps back now and then to bring into light the characters' pasts.  I felt like I knew them and I understood why they were the way they were and why they acted like they did.  I wasn't a stranger to them like in some books where you have no idea what's wrong with the main characters' heads.  However, I knew there was going to be bloodshed, and I feared it would be too graphic for me.  Though the circumstances are harsh and the teenagers are fighting each other to the death, the story is not void of love, which begins to entwine itself into the lives of the main characters, and at times even pity and sorrow.  Though some of the ending scenes in The Hunger Games were probably the worst yet, as far as violence goes, I finished the book and would read it again.  The story is definitely left with some open endings, which is reasonable since there are books to follow it, but the story is not left at a confusing end where you don't understand what has happened.  When I finished the book, I was sad that the thrill and adventure was over, but that only makes me more eager to read the second one and return to the Districts again to see what happens next...  If you want to know what it's all about, why so many people are trying to get their hands on this book, then pick it up and see for yourself.  Don't forget to hold on tight, because this book is going to take you on a ride you won't forget.
I couldn't put this book down! This novel is incomparable to any other. The storyline, characters and events all had me mesmerized. The author, Suzanne Collins, has one of the most original storylines. She creates them off the top of her head, and it's phenomenal. She had me hooked the whole way through. Some of the best parts were violent, and some extremely compassionate.    The story includes many settings and locations. But three environments stood out to being most significant; District twelve, the arena, and the capitol. District 12 is the district that Katniss Everdeen (main character), resides in. She lives with her mother and sister, Primrose. Twelve is beyond doubt a poverty-stricken district. Many families are starving. Not many jobs are to be had. These people don't live a joyful life unless they try to. Many family members died in a mine accident, leaving many families lonely and depressed.  The second setting, the arena is completely terrifying. The arena is where the 24 tributes fight to the death, between ages 12-18. Many innocent lives are lost, all for the entertainment of the capitol's citizens. The last and final significant setting is the capitol. The capitol, and the whole country of Panem, is ruled by a terrible man by the name of President Snow. The capitol is very rich and really enforces the rules of the Hunger games.    The characters are by far the most interesting and attention-capturing aspect of the novel. They make the story. My favorite, however, is Rue. Rue is a petite and little twelve year old girl from district 11, who becomes allies with Katniss early on in the story. Katniss cares for her until she dies, which broke my heart.   The problem that is trying to be solved in this whole story is to get Katniss and Peeta out of the arena, still breathing with a beating heart. Although it seems impossible, they actually pull it off! They completed this almost impossible act by showing strong and rebellious actions, causing the games to conclude.  One specific event that really stood out to me is when Katniss and Peeta first team up and reside in a small cave. They learned that they really don't hate each other, and they decided to team up as allies trying to win the games together. They survive by sharing the gifts that they both receive from the games sponsors. After caretaking for each other, they fall in love. They become very passionate for one another, and the whole way through the book, they leave you hoping that they come out together and live happily ever after.  But all great novels must come to and end. The two lovebirds escape the horrific arena and return back to their families in district 12. But the fame has just begun. They still have a victory tour to do, consuming much of their time. But hey, wouldn't you rather be touring Panem instead of being dead? This book will always be a top 5 contender on my list.
The Hunger Games surprised me in many ways.  It is a brilliantly written, moving piece of work, made terrifying by how real it seems.  I felt guilty about how much I enjoyed going through the games with Katniss and Peeta, because doesn't that make me as bad as the rest of the Capitol people, glued to their tv sets to watch the whole horrible thing unfold?  The Hunger Games tells the story of Katniss, a 16 year old with way too many responsibilities.  She lives in the coal mining district of a changed North America, that has 12 disctricts, each one producing a different commodity, which is used primarily by the residents of the Capitol; who defeated the Districts in a long ago war.  Each year, to remind the citizens of the districts of it's power, the Capitol holds an event called the Hunger Games.  Each district must supply two 'tributes'.  the Tributes are children aged between 12-18 years, who will fight to the death in a staged arena.  There can only be one victor and the victor and their district are showered with wealth, food and gifts.  It's no huge surprise that Katniss eventually becomes one tribute, with a boy she barely knows - Peeta Mellark the other.  Together they prepare for the games, with some surprising strategies and help in the form of their stylists, and the only living victor from district 12 - Haymitch.  The story unfolds at a rapid pace after this, and in the spirit of keeping it spoiler free, I wont comment on the games themselves.  What I found enjoyable was the layering of character - the way everyone is playing one role, when they mostly need to be another.  The violence is shocking, perhaps all the more so because they are children, and it has haunted me since I finished the book.  The scenes with Rue moved me a lot, and thanks to the movie preview, I have a four note bird call stuck in my head.  The Hunger games was a fantastic read, and one that stuck with me afterwards for a long time.  Highly recommended.
Are you hungry for a new book to suck you in? The book, Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, will surly satisfies your need. It is about a girl, Katniss Everdeen, and her adventure through the Hunger Games. She lives in District 12 of Panem. Panem is the ruins of a place once known as North America. North America has been taken over by President Snow, a dictator. Katniss and most of the other districts suffer harshly through life. Two people, a boy and a girl, from each district every year get a chance to fight for life and food.   The two people, a boy and a girl, from each district have a chance to have lots of money and plentiful food with their families through the Hunger Games. The qualifications for the Hunger Games are that the person chosen can't be a victor of the games and has to be 12-18 years old. The winner of the Hunger Games gets to live in a great house in the Victor Village of their district. If the tributes make an alliance, the Game Makers will eventually force the tributes to break the alliance.   The 2 main characters in this book are Katniss and Peeta. They are both 16 years old and live in District 12. Katniss is courageous, kind-hearted, and is always thinking about her family and Gale, Katniss' best friend. She struggles to take care of her family on her own because her father and Gale's father died in a mine explosion. She hunts with Gale almost every day and depends on that day's haul to feed her, her sister, and her mother. Katniss likes to shoot bow `n arrows and trade her profit at the Hob, a black market.   Peeta is strong, creative, smart, and can camouflage anything. He is known as "Lover Boy" in the story. He trys to sacrifice his life for his true love. Peeta's father is a baker and was once in love with Katniss' mother. Peeta loves to paint and decorate cakes.   I have many favorite parts in this book. My most favorite part is when Peeta reviles a huge secret on air. I love this part because it changes the entire book. It gives me a new prospective of the book. Peeta's secret adds a new twist. It forces you to keep reading the Hunger Games.   As you can probably tell, I liked the book Hunger Games. I liked it because there was always something happening in the book. I felt like I was looking through Katniss' eyes through the whole story. Hunger Games had much suspense. I laughed when Katniss told me, through her thoughts, the story of when she meets Gale. I really loved the book!   The genre of the Hunger Games is science-fiction because all the story events could possibly happen. For example one day a dictator, like President Snow, could take over North America and call it Panem. The dictator could also turn North America into 12 districts. Then, the dictator could suppress its people.   A person with a sense of adventure, vivid imagination, and likes action will love this book! All people will get sucked into this book. Hunger Games is by Suzanne Collins and its publisher is Scholastic. I would suggest this book to anyone that is 11-15 years old, depending on maturity. You should read Hunger Games it will take you on an adventure.
"The Hunger Games" is by far one of the best novels in the young adult genre ever written. Suzanne Collins wrote an intense dystopian book that is impossible to put down, even the second time through.   The country is Panem, separated into twelve districts and the capital. Every year to remind the citizens of the district of the power the capital holds, there are the Hunger Games. Each district must supply two tributes, one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and sixteen to go to the arena, where the tributes must fight each other to the death because there can only be one victor.   Katniss Everdeen is just sixteen years old when her twelve year old sister's name is called during the Reaping Ceremony and Katniss steps up to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games. Alongside Katniss, is another familiar boy, a classmate, Peeta. But only one of them will come home alive.   Collins is simply an amazing author. The story takes off right from the beginning and trust me, it's a constant page turner and every chapter ends with a cliff hanger forcing you into the next. The novel is so short that it is almost unbelievable because there is so much action and adventure packed in and absolutely nothing is rushed.   Katniss takes an amazing emotional journey. She goes from Katniss Everdeen to The Girl on Fire and it's hard for her to even know the difference. She even seems to have opposing ideas on boys. The first time I read this novel I didn't get into the romance at all, but upon reading it a second time I very much enjoyed the romance.   This book is a must, must, must read! Collin's took the cautionary tale that dystopian has to offer and made it accessible to teens. There is so much emotion in this book and it is absolutely brilliant.
This was quite an amazing book. I'm already a quarter of the way into the second one -- that's how much I had to stay in the story. I couldn't even stop to write a review. When I began this book, I had no idea what it would be about. I had not read a synopsis, I had just been hearing how much everybody loved this series. So I began. I was confused at the beginning and couldn't get a good feel for the characters, but this only lasted a few pages. Then things got going and I was hooked.  The story begins with Katniss Everdeen and quickly introduces her mother, younger sister, Prim and her friend and hunting partner, Gale. Katniss's father had died in a mine explosion when she was young and ever since then, she's had to provide food for her family by illegally hunting in the grounds outside of District 12 - her home. The book is set in a sort of post-apocaliptic (more post-rebellion/uprising) in the United States. But by the time the story takes place we are to understand that there are 12 Districts that exist (there was a 13th, but the reason it no longer exists is a mystery to the reader) and they are all ruled by The Capitol. Each of the Districts is kept separated, with no one allowed to leave. We are introduced to the concept of The Hunger Games very soon. Apparently, The Capitol forcibly holds these games each year in order to keep the Districts in line. To remind them of who has the power -- and who doesn't. Each District holds a lottery of sorts on the Reaping Day every year, with the results being that two teenagers (one boy and one girl) is chosen to participate in The Hunger Games as tributes. This will make 24 participants in all coming from the 12 Districts. These games will be a fight to the death in an arena of The Capitol's choosing. Katniss is one of this year's tributes, along with a boy from her district, Peeta Mellark. The story follows them (from Katniss's point of view) through their ordeal of being prepped for the games and then through the horrible few weeks of fighting, running, hiding, killing, outsmarting, watching people die, almost dying themselves and many other horrors they are faced to endure for The Capitol.  This is an amazing story of endurance, control, perseverance, determination and love. I fell in love with Katniss and the difficulty she has in sorting out her feelings and knowing how to react and what to do -- should she act for herself, thinking of her own emotions? For The Capitol, trying to please them? For Peeta, trying to save him? The Hunger Games has everything a good story should have: deep characters, meaningful actions, adventure, trials, difficulties, romance and love. I highly recommend this book and am just taking a guess, but will probably recommend the whole series. That's all for now...I have to get back to reading.
This story takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting.  Civilization has been patched together after some disaster, men gathering together for safety under the iron fisted rule of a totalitarian government.  Once a year ever district in the government has is required to provide two teenage candidates selected by lottery to take part in the Hunger Games - a sort of gladiatorial survival challenge. The winner of the games secures wealth and fame for themselves, and food and supplied for their home district for a year.  Hunger Games centers around two such "tributes" selected from a small, out of the way mining district sent to compete and die in the Games.  Our first tribute is Katniss. It's hard not to love her.  From the earliest moments in the story we see her strength.  She's the sister that stepped up to provide for the family when her father died, and her mother was crippled by grief.  She's the one that willing volunteered to go to her death in the Hunger Games in her sister's place.  She's noble, strong, selfless, and a complete bad ass.  She's not soft - life hasn't allowed her to be.  She's actually quite brutal at times, but we find ourselves loving her despite that.   Then we have Peetra, the male tribute, who is kind, honest, gentle, and well spoken.  He has the heart in this story.  He's compassionate, and understanding, but seemingly soft.  Basically the perfect complement to Katniss.  I loved the interactions of these two characters - how beautifully they balanced one another.  Peetra was by far my favorite character in the whole series.  His unconditional, selfless care for everyone around him, his kindness, and his loyalty were inspirational.  At every point in this story and the ones that followed, you could rely on him to be a reliable moral compass.  Ultimately the story centers around these two.  There are a host of well written and amazing side kicks too though - standouts for me were:  Cinna, Kat's stylist who transformed her into a small down mining girl to the Girl Who Was on Fire.  More than any other character, I think he's what got Kat through the first part of the story.  I loved his quite care, and his seeming silent support for the rebellion.  Rue - the tiny little girl from the agricultural district that Kat befriends during the Games.  Her sweet trust and care for Kat were so beautiful, and the most heart wrenching parts of the story centered around her.  I could have taken or left Gale, Kat's childhood friend in this story.  He seemed more of a background character to me.  And I had a love hate relationship with Haymitch, Kat's grizzled, alcoholic mentor.  He really set me off on the wrong foot initially, but really grew on me through the story.  I loved how he and Kat seemed to understand each other's unspoken messages.  There is not a lot of romance, especially in the first book.  There seems to be genuine care between Peetra and Katniss, but you are left constantly wondering how much of that care is real or feigned for the sake of the cameras.  In this story I felt Peetra's care was genuine, and Kat's was growing, mostly unbeknownst to herself.  I have zero complaints with the world building in Hunger Games - which is often a point of complaint for me, so well done Ms. Collins! :D The world is dark, and brutal, not quite as much so as Enclave, but close.  I felt the author did a great job making everything very realistic and understandable.  I saw the logic behind the districts, the way the government was organized, and even the Hunger Games themselves. While initially sending kids into battle seemed silly, after I understood it as a punishment for rebellion and a chance for those kids to earn enough food to feed their whole, starving district it made perfect sense.  Plot wise, Hunger games started off a bit slow for me - the author had to spend quite a bit of time explaining the world, establishing the characters, and dealing with their histories.  As such, many of the first chapters of the book centered around memories.  But around the time Peetra and Katniss were sent to the games, I found myself completely pulled into the story.  I loved the way the author described the challenges in the Games.  I literally hung on her every word through the entire experience.  And there were moments of such heartbreak and beauty.  I cried numerous times throughout the story.  By the end of the book I was completely emotionally drained, filled with both sorrow and triumph.  It was a masterfully written story that started slow and built steadily to a cathartic end.  I truly loved this book.
My youngest daughter (age 14) handed me the book after she finished reading it.  I read it in a weekend and found it to be a real page turner (5-stars).  I immediately went onto Amazon and bought the two follow on books.  This is definitely a book that parents should read before (or immediately after) their children have and then have discussions about the book.  I know that we all have above average intelligence children and they will be able to understand the book completely on their own -- but maybe discussing the book together will bring you closer.  You certainly will want to take the opportunity to help re-enforce what morality you believe your child should have.  This is the main reason that I knocked off one star -- parents really should read the book and discuss it with their children.  The book is dark.  If it were a movie, I would argue it needs more comic relief.  Judge your own child's personality and decide if reading dark material would bring them down too much or can they easily separate out a depressing story from reality.  Having read all three books (and yes, this part doesn't pertain to *just* The Hunger Games), it feels like there was one large book written and it was broken into two and a half books.  At the end of the two and half books there were lots of unanswered questions and the filler was added trying to answer those questions (stretching the whole to three books).  The first two books are absolute page turners.  The third book (which did not effect the star rating for this book) is a little choppy as it tries to cover questions that the reader might have.  I wasn't going to write a review until I read some of the other reviews.  Some have complained that there is no moral message to the book.  There is, but it is subtle.  If you miss the moral message it is possible that your world view is too different from the message.  And no, I won't say what I believe the message to be because I hate spoilers in reviews).  Some have complained that the characters are unrealistic in their goals and values.  If the characters were coming straight from our world, I would agree.  However, if you imagine the toll on priorities and how the dark world that Suzanne Collins created would wear and morph people's values over the preceding generations, I would say that Ms Collin's projection of people's values is certainly plausible.  I'm certainly not willing to run an experiment to find out.  Some have complained that the story is a blatant rip off of other stories.  These same people point to the beauty of J.K.Rowling.  While I thoroughly enjoy  Rowling's work, perhaps these reviewers should read Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game -- and realize what a blatant rip-off the Potter series is ...  No.  Even after pointing out the remarkable similarities, Card goes on to defend people taking the same plot line and weaving their own stories around it.  After all, aren't there only 7 plots?  In summary, if you normally don't read what your children are reading, I would make an exception in this case.  If you can, read the book(s) before they do.  If you can't, try to read the books anyway and discuss them with your kids.
The country of Panem consists of 13 districts, out of which 12 still stand. 13th was eradicated after the rebellion towards the Capitol, and ever since - to keep remaining districts in line - the Capitol throws The Hunger Games. A girl and boy are from each District is picked to play through lottery - play until only one of the 24 players is alive. The players must be between 12 and 18 years old.  In District 12 Katniss has learned to survive and provide for her family after her father's death by hunting outside the fence, which is illegal, but has fed her mother and her little sister Prim. As the Hunger Games lottery day is upon them, it is Prim who's name is pulled out and Katniss cannot see any other way to save her sister except take her place in the games. Katniss is joined by Peeta a baker's son, and together, yet apart, they have to face the games.  The world is gritty dystopian, where the ruling class rules and the people follow. The mandatory Hunger Games is a disgusting idea, setting people against each other, no setting kids, against each other.  Modern society, atleast western, sees this as such a taboo that I can see why this book is so popular. I mean what would you do? Could you enter the games and not kill if your life depended on it? Could you defend yourself till death? Could you stay invisible and wait until others finish themselves off? How would you survive being hunted? Would you come out of it sane if you did win?  Wonderfully written, engaging and colored beautifully with survival vs. morals. This book has me complitely addicted, and cannot wait to read the second instalment! I have had this book on the back of my mind since Stephanie Meyer recommend it to her fans few years back. I can see why she was excited about it as well.  I'd like to think I'd have the strength Katniss has if I'd be in her shoes. If the world would collapse back to early 1900's and became a police state I hope I'd be able to handle myself. That is the kind of ideas this book gives, and I think people learning to hunt or gather thanks to this book may actually save some lives which is great accomplishment.  If you haven't read this book yet, do so, it's amazing!
I literally couldn't put this book down. Since purchasing it yesterday afternoon, I have since finished both Hunger Games AND its Chasing Fire. Although it was an excellent, fast-paced, very intense read, I am feeling extremely needled by the glowing reputation of "originality" that Collins has gained for her development of the hunger games concept. I do not wish to offend any other readers, and (as I have stated) I did truly truly enjoy this book - read it in under 5 hours, in fact, when I should have been packing. However, I keep reading comments on Collins' originality in developing the CONCEPT of the games themselves. This is where I take issue: Any other readers out there who have seen the Japanese film "Battle Royale" would agree (I hope) that there are glaring similarities between the plot of that movie and that of the hunger games. I'll insert the Wikipedia link for any who are interested; it's an excellent movie with many themes identical to Collins' ( ...)). To sum up the plot of Battle Royale: Japanese schoolchildren are randomly selected by lottery to be dumped on a desert island. They are randomly given a selection of weapons (machete, gun, knife, pot, map, binoculars, etc), and then set loose. They must battle to the death until only one child survives. There are strong overtones of governmental abuse of power, fascism, as well as the "coincidental" similarity that this is done to punish a rebellious population. FURTHERMORE, the island is divided into quadrants, each of which is a danger zone during designated hours. This strikes far too close to Chasing Fire's game trick of dividing the arena into a clock with different dangers during different hours. I have an extremely strong feeling Collins might have derived quite a LOT of inspiration/material from this relatively unknown (in America) movie, which has way too many exactly-the-same devices to write off as mere coincidence. While I still think the book is compellingly written (I cried during a few of the more emotional points), I think it's really annoying that Collins hasn't ever been asked whether she's watched this movie (which came out many years ago). Furthermore, in the extremely likely event she was inspired by Battle Royale, I think it's pretty ridiculous she's been given all these compliments regarding her originality without giving credit where credit's due. I hope this doesn't discourage anyone from reading the book - it's one of the most interesting I've read in a while. This review was merely to - hopefully - open some readers' eyes to an equally compelling movie with a very similar plot.
A friend of mine bought me "The Hunger Games" over a year ago, but I only got around to reading it about a month ago. In two weeks I made my way through the entire trilogy, and while I do have some criticisms, for the most part I HIGHLY recommend this series. However, there are a few disclaimers I would put out there for any adult or child about to take the plunge into Suzanne Collin's dystopian world.  1) If you're a parent or teacher, I would use discretion in allowing anyone under the age of 13 to read these books. Not so much due to the graphic nature of the novels (although it might cause sensitive readers some distress), but because there are many prevalent, subtle themes that would most likely be lost on anyone under 13 who *isn't* an extremely mature reader: mainly, the themes of irony and hypocrisy, appearance versus reality, and the struggles to maintain humanity in an impossible situation would be lost on the average 12 and even 13 year old. In my opinion, 14 to 17 is the ideal *target* age group, though it's a gripping read and thought-provoking series for adults too! Please keep this in mind if you are planning on recommending this to a young reader you know.  2) This series isn't "perverse," "disturbed," or "sick"; it's a science-fiction (emphasis on the 'fiction') series that uses a controversial futuristic scenario to provide social commentary and provoke questions very relevant to our society today. Yes, these books involve children murdering each other, but that's part of the PLOT, and it's meant to make you THINK. As a reader, you're of course supposed to think that the fictional Capitol is perverse and disturbed -- as you well should if you have any sense of morality -- but it's misdirected to aim anny disgust at the author. Collins is not writing about such horrific violence to be gratuitous: she has invented a fictional world in which horrific violence is gratuitous in order to make a POINT.  As long as you keep in mind both of these points, prepare yourself for an excellent (yet brutal), fast-paced, andsuspenseful YA series. No they are not perfect works of literary art by any means, but the concept is brilliant and for the most part the books are sufficiently written and well imagined. A definite new favorite of mine!
I positively devoured The Hunger Games as many did before me. While Katniss's world is often viewed as a dystopia, I view it more as a post-apocalyptic world as few citizen's really believe that everything is perfect. One of my favorite things in fiction is a strong female lead, and Katniss served these purposes to the fullest. Katniss has spent her life since her father died providing for her mother and younger sister by hunting, trading, and entering her name in for The Hunger Games extra times in exchange for extra provisions. She would do anything to protect her little sister, including entering herself into almost certain death by competing in The Hunger Games.  She is a character that is easy to cheer for, even if she perhaps utterly dense on romantic feelings towards her. The romance in the books, is really the one problem that I had with the series, and that is because of the 'first love' that takes place in the past. This sort of romantic triangle seems to be happening in a lot of the books I've read lately (The Iron Fey, Matched) and for me, it's never the 'triangle' that is intended to be, as I much less reason to cheer for the first love, then I do the one I watch happening. Despite this however, the Hunger Games did succeed in making me want to see more of the Gale's character, as I want more chances for him to make me love him over Peeta.  Peeta I adored, as I loved that he didn't have to always be the strong one. It was a great 'turnabout is fair play' move, with watching the female character be more of a provider and protector then that of the male lead. There are a few other side character in The Hunger Games that I absolutely adored, and would love to see more of as well.  Despite that The Hunger games was more action-packed then I usually like my books to be, I was hooked the entire time. For Katniss, every bit of action is an emotional decision, and because of that I never found myself skimming over the action scenes as I have in the past. The Hunger Games is an original concept, with the only thing coming to mind that is similar, Battle Royale.
Reading some of the other reviews on here, it's apparent that this is a very successful, very talked-about book...that somehow I totally missed; I'd never heard of it until a few weeks ago.  During a discussion of good books to read, a friend whose opinion I trusted brought it up, and I just added it to my cart with a bunch of other books, only reading enough of the synopsis to think, "yeah, that might be OK."  Then last night I was watching the first season of the new Doctor Who, and there was an episode where the doctor and his companions are teleported into some futuristic game shows.  In these game shows, getting evicted from the Big Brother house or being voted the Weakest Link got the contestants disintegrated.  When the show was over, I was thinking, "Now, why was that so familiar?"  Then I remembered the book I'd bought but hadn't read.  So I started it about an hour before bed.  To give you an idea of how much I enjoyed the book, you should know I read every night before bed.  It's part of my ritual and I think the actual act of reading has turned into a sort of Pavlovian hypnotic.  Usually I only get through a couple pages before my eyes start getting heavy and I have to put the book down.  If the book is particularly excellent, I might soldier on to the end of a chapter before succumbing.  Not this book.  I actually stayed up half the night to finish it.  Fortunately it only took me about five or six hours to read, because I literally could not put it down - and with as much as I had to do this morning, running on no sleep would have been awful.  Do I need a warning about spoilers when hundreds of reviews have outlined the plot already?  I don't think I'm going to spoil anything anyway, but just in case, consider this your warning.  The other reviews outlined the plot pretty clearly, so I'll skip that.  Just a few observations: the plot has been done before, several times.  It has tones of 1984 and very clearly reminded me of Stephen King's "The Long Walk" and the beginning of Piers Anthony's Chromagic series...and, as I mentioned, was very similar to that episode of Doctor Who that I'd just watched.  Reused plots don't annoy me as much as they do some people; as long as the writing is good, I don't mind familiar territory.  Nor did I mind the predictability - since there are three books, it's not a big leap to guess that Katniss survives.  The writing, while on the simple side, was very well done and often very funny.  I liked the fact that we weren't herded into liking Katness; she's an overall likable character, but she's not perfect, not superhuman, and not always very nice.  In my opinion, that made her all the more real.  What I did mind, and why the book is getting four stars instead of five, is the ending.  It was rather rushed compared to the beginning.  The whole first part of the book was a fairly detailed account of the events leading up to the games.  In comparison, the end hits you like a brick wall.  The most irritating part was the cliffhanger at the end.  I've always been of the opinion that books in a series should stand on their own and that the desire for a new, separate story because you like the world or the characters is the incentive to read the next book.  This ended more like a serial soap opera.  "To be continued," or "stay tuned for the continuing story of..."  The book didn't end like this part of the story was over, it ended more on a commercial break - as though one very long book got chopped into pieces.  Yeah, I'm going to buy the next book and read it, but it feels like coercion, and it left me feeling piqued.  My one other gripe is that I really would have liked to have learned more about this future Earth - how did the planet get to this point?  How big are the districts and how are they laid out?  What's life like for people outside of Katniss's personal world?  These things are touched on, but in my opinion could have been fleshed out quite a bit more than they were.  Of course, there could be more of this in the books to come, but if that's the case, we get back to my earlier complaint about having to buy the next book to continue the story.  But that aside, it's still an outstanding book.  You should read it, and you might as well buy the other books straight away because you'll be all kinds of frustrated if you get to the end and then have to wait for the next installment to be shipped.  Just be sure you block out plenty of time to finish it, because you aren't going to want to interrupt the experience if real life intervenes.
Let me start by saying that I decided to read this book because I was tired of being reminded that I really need to read this book. The Hunger Game series is on the top of most must read lists, so when I finally set down to read I was happy to find that I was not disappointed.  This book was interesting because the idea was without question unique. I had to get over the shock of the idea of reading about twelve to eighteen year olds killing each other to survive while an entire country watched what happened live. Today our world is filled with such jaded young people that I am sure this was not as big a shock to some other readers, but to me it was the hardest part especially if I became overly attached to a character.  Suzanne Collins made it easy to become attached to the all the characters in different ways, but the character that stole my heart was little Rue. While she is not a main character, she just brought me to tears at one point. Of course the other character I loved was the main character, Katniss. The story is told from her perspective. The internal dialogue she had with herself was comical at times, but for the most part it was her struggle to maintain her identity when every page threatened to take more of her true self away. Of course, no teen book is complete without some sexy men characters and Collins did not disappoint. There was Gale the boy who she has come to depend on and trust her family's lives with. Then, there was Peeta the boy who she must face in The Hunger Games, and if she wants to survive, come to terms with killing. Collins is truly gifted at developing her characters, making you cheer for necessary blood shed, but reminding the reader that even those that seemed to enjoy being in The Hunger Games were living as best as they could in a system set up for failure.  Now, the part I hate. The reason why The Hunger Games did not get a five out of five was because the ending felt rushed. The book is broken up into three parts that flowed together nicely, then all of a sudden "the games" were over and all of the other players were gone. It wasn't that I did not expect the end to come, just that it felt as if she decided: "That's it! They all must die!"  Overall, I thought the book was great. I will definitely be reading the rest of the series because I want to see how Collins continues the story. I hope you go out and pick up this book knowing that it will not disappoint.

EDIT:  After further reflection, I decided to bump this up to four stars.  "The Hunger Games" is a compelling story that I read in a single sitting because I found it to be a fast-paced, interesting read.  It features a girl name Katniss along with 23 other participants in a barbaric fight-to-the-death "game" that is supposed to serve as entertainment for the nation as well as some kind of deterrent to rebellion.  I marked the story down half a star because I felt it was a bit lacking in setup to explain how North America devolved into a society called "Panem" that pits kids against each other in death matches.  I would have appreciated some more back story to explain what happened 74+ years ago to form the various districts and the reasoning behind the "games". I realize this is a trilogy, and that might get explained in later books; however, I felt it would be essential information to include in the first book.  I marked the story down a second half star because it seems unsporting to mix 12 to 18-year-olds together in a death match.  Imagine going to a football game and you have 6th graders playing against seniors in high school.  The game would be incredibly lopsided and frankly -- quite boring.  I think the Hunger Games would be just as boring watching overpowered competitors demolish the weak competitors.  I also think it would be boring to watch weak competitors that have little to no survival skills trying to survive the elements let alone the other competitors.  I'm by no means advocating death matches for entertainment, but in a society that does, I think it would be much more competitive to have participants that are closer in age and abilities.  In closing, this was a riveting story, but in the back of mind, I kept thinking "I'm reading about a bunch of kids killing each other!"  I'm hopeful later books in the series will develop a rebellion that will put an end to these horrific games.
There are plenty of eloquently written synopses of this novel here on Amazon, so I will spare you another re-telling.  However, I would like to share why the title of my review has a double-meaning:  I am indeed hungry to continue reading the trilogy--I read this book in one evening and will most likely knock the other two out this weekend.  The premise of the book was great, and with respect to the concepts of government abuse and the uglier aspects of human nature, I could easily draw parallels to our world today.  I found the author's writing style to be engaging and relatable, much like her characters in the story.  And due to the abrupt, cliffhanger-ish ending I want to know "the rest of the story."  This reminds me of why I'm still hungry...  Maybe I've watched too many Tarantino movies or read too many Stephen King novels, but I was not blown away by the "goriness" or "brutality" that so many reviewers mentioned.  It's the overall theme of humanity gone wrong that I find most scary, not the physical acts of atrocity that were committed in the book.  That's innate fight-or-flight right there.  The heroine's struggle to survive didn't leave an indelible mark on my soul either, nor did the potential "love triangle" constructed by the author.  I appreciate a great romance as much as the next reader, but I distinctly recall thinking that I would've enjoyed the whole "first kiss vs. real first kiss with feelings" if I were still a teenaged girl.  For me the mark of an engrossing book is if I lose all track of time and place, and the world falls away to the point where I don't hear or see anything but the characters.  I know many readers gave this book 5 stars, which for me means this book would've produced some sort of paradigm shift.  For me it was an enjoyable read, but I could also read it while performing other tasks, so instead I gave it 3 stars.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins follows the story of a girl name Katniss. It takes place in a future where the world has changed dramatically. As a result of wars that have taken place, the Capitol institutes a yearly event, called The Hunger Games, to remind the people of their past and to make sure it will never happen again. These games are central to the entire story for the main character, as the reader follows her through the emotions and turmoil she experiences.  The Good: The storytelling in The Hunger Games is top-notch. I found myself swiftly enthralled with the world the author created. I cared about the characters. I felt the pain and agony of the games. This is a very well written book. The author tells the story from the first-person perspective by the main character, Katniss. Throughout the entirety of the book, you come to know the character very well - as the author describes her feelings with a lot of detail. Many times I found myself caught up in the character's thoughts to the point that I forgot it I was even reading it in the first-person perspective. There's no doubt about it that this is an enjoyable book to read.  The Bad: Being unfamiliar with the Young Adult genre of books, my gripe on The Bad might be something that is inherent with similar books. Throughout the book, the character tends to repeat many of her thoughts and feelings. The author mentions the past regularly, and that past being referred to often is the same thing over in over. This is a minor annoyance, but it is there nonetheless. Fortunately, it doesn't taint the overall story. Which leads me to the most ironic thing about this book...  The Ugly: I'm not sure if this was the author's intent, but the one thing I absolutely did not like about The Hunger Games was The Hunger Games. The reasoning behind why The Hunger Games - a brutal match of young children where they all fight to the death and there is one winner, all of this televised for the population to see and for some reason enjoy - is unbelievable. I cannot see in any society tolerating something like this. I do not understand why people would accept it. The whole basis for this book feels so completely implausible that I found myself totally distracted by it while reading the entire book.  In the end, I really liked The Hunger Games. Despite the impossible premise, the story the author tells is very good. I've never read a book that made me feel so conflicted, and I guess that is a good thing. The fact that I like it so much in one respect and hate it in another is a testament to what the author wrote. Intentional or not, the book strikes a chord in some form and makes you think. I highly suggest you give this one a read.
At its most basic, The Hunger Games is about a group of children being forced into a game of survival in a hostile environment where they are required to eliminate the competition in order to survive.  Thus, at its most basic, it is not all that different from Battle Royale: The Novel which is really what interested me in reading it in the first place.  That said, once you get past that basic premise the two are very different books though both are really quite excellent.  Like Battle Royale, however, this really isn't the sort of book that will be everyone's cup of tea.  If the basic premise turns you off, this probably isn't the book for you no matter how good I or anyone else says it is.  Because, as the premise suggests, the action is occasionally pretty brutal, the themes are quite mature and not everything is going to turn nicely and not everyone is going to survive.  That said, it's a damn fun read packed with plenty of drama, action and suspense and well worth your time if dystopian fiction with a survival beat is your thing.  The Hunger Games takes place in a dystopian future where a single city called the Capital is the seat of government and rules over the twelve districts and the people within them.  The people of the districts are incredibly poor and often starving, forced to spend their lives in the service of the Capital through the production of goods and by laboring in the industry which is the specialty of their particular region.  Many years before the beginning of The Hunger Games there was a 13th district which attempted to overthrow the Capital and was summarily destroyed.  As a reminder of the Capital's overwhelming strength, two children from each remaining district are selected to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a game of survival from which only one child of the twenty-four participating will return alive.  The first in a trilogy, The Hunger Games works surprisingly well all on its own.  So much so that the remaining two books in the trilogy are more a pleasant surprise than a necessary part of the overall story.  That said, if you enjoyed it as much as I did, you'll almost certainly be excited to dive into the next book to discover the fallout of the events of The Hunger Games.  There is a great deal in The Hunger Games to love as the world-building is solid and the pacing, while a bit slow in the beginning, quickly steps up as the contestants for the games are chosen and the real action begins.  Action which is tempered with intrigue as the games are portrayed as being not only a way to keep the Districts in line, but also as the height of entertainment for the citizens of the Capital.  There is a lot of pomp and circumstance that leads up to the actual games which adds an interesting dynamic to both the games and the characters participating in them.  As the story is told strictly from a single point of view, that of Katniss of District 12, the development of secondary characters does suffer as Katniss takes very little notice in people she isn't readily invested in.  That said, the entire story being told from her POV does help ratchet up the tension and suspense since the motivations of several other major characters are never entirely clear. As a result what might otherwise be a weakness seems a fair trade-off especially in this first novel where there is so much else going on that knowing too much about the supporting cast might just bog things down.  I imagine it will become a larger issue going forward, but for now it's a pretty minor complaint about an otherwise awesome book.
I don't often read YA novels, but the attention this series has been receiving intrigued me, and I was in the mood for a quick sci-fi read anyway.  Turns out that "The Hunger Games" is a terrific novel that many adults will likely enjoy.  The basic plot has been outlined numerous times in previous reviews here - in a future version of North America, each of 12 colonies has to select by lottery one boy and one girl to fight in the Hunger Games, which is a televised battle to the death.  Our heroine is Katniss Everdeen from impoverished coal-mining District 12.  She has all the requisite skills for the games, given that she has had to become a hunter to support her mother and younger sister following the death of her father.  Katniss makes for a fantastic, likeable heroine; she's not portrayed as invincible or unduly brave.  She's a fairly average young woman who shows tremendous resourcefulness when placed in an impossible situation.  I appreciated that author Suzanne Collins didn't try to make her of superhero stuff; instead, Katniss' reactions are realistic, which helps ground the story.  For a sci-fi novel, the book generally is quite realistic, and therefore rather violent for a YA book.  However, I think it's quite appropriate for its target audience (14 years and up).  Although the book is classified as sci-fi, I think it will appeal to many readers who do not regularly read in that genre.  In particular, the survival and outdoors aspects set it apart from many sci-fi novels.  I don't often read sci-fi but I was sucked into the story immediately.  The book is extremely well-written and plotted - a true page turner.  When I'm reading a book series, a good indicator of how much I'm enjoyed the current entry is how long I wait until I download the next book onto my Kindle.  Let's just say that "Catching Fire" was downloaded and ready to go long before I completed reading "The Hunger Games."  I can't wait to see what direction this series goes in next.
Typically, I read just about anything. If I absolutely hate it, Ill never finish and it will be prime Goodwill donation fare. If I like it, but have to slog through it I will, but wont ever read it again - although I might try to get through the series. BUT, If its written well enough to capture me, then I will read it more than once, which is what happened with "the Hunger Games".  I am growing to appreciate the dystopian genre, and this was my first introduction (in book format). I honestly could not put it down and read it over a few days time. Then I absolutely had to have the 2nd. And waited anxiously for the third. As a first in a series, it is tough to avoid reviewing as a part of a whole body of work. But without giving away too much here is what I honestly thought of JUST the Hunger Games.  I loved the character of Katniss. She has a sort of Greek Goddess thing going, like Diana the hunter - pure and ruthless, strong and likable, human, but more. Other characters that stood out to me - of course Haymitch. Whats not to love? A guy who is smart, sassy, desperately trying to help the two tributes from a district that is not known for "winners". And who did not love Rue - smart, shy, practical, innocent, victim of the ruthless world of adults who have taken her life in a sacrificial entertainment system. And of course I am definitely a huge fan of Peeta. Even though he started out a little "whitebread", he became the perfect foil to Katniss - he is loving, she is closed off, he is passionate, she is cold, he is (relatively) spoiled, she lived a live full of deprivation. They are total opposites in everything to the degree that like salt and pepper, complement and complete each other...or so we think.  I have to agree that the brutality presented by the author, especially towards the end in that "one particular scene", that has been mentioned, might be a little too scary for 10-12 year olds, but it made the story much more poignant.  I love the fast-paced adventurous-ness, the cliff-hangers in every chapter. Just when you think that all is lost, and the character will be faced with certain painful death, something comes to the rescue (typically its her skills and smarts), and I loved that roller-coaster ride of adrenalin-pumping "what will happen next?"  In short, I definitely reccomend "The Hunger Games".
This book, the first in the Hunger Games trilogy, is unbelievably good. book is set in the U.S. in the future, after events have transpired resulting in the U.S. becoming a new country called Panem, which is divided into thirteen districts around the Capitol, which has imposed a firm dictatorship on the people.  The book centers on Katniss, a young girl from "District 12", one of the poorest districts from the coal-producing region.  Every year, the districts are forced to participate in the "Hunger Games" as an object lesson of the Capitol's power and dominion over them.  One girl and one boy between the ages of 12-18 are selected from each district to fight in a to-the-death competition in an arena created by the Capitol.  This is mandatory viewing for the entire country.  Katniss ends up as the female contestant from District 12 and must bring all of her survival instincts with her to have any chance in the arena.  This book is similar to other "survival of the fittest" books like The Long Walk by Stephen King and Battle Royale by Koushon Takami and it has the same horrifying can't-put-this-down fascination as those books.  In addition, however, this book has more character development and more surprising elements than in those books. Particularly in the later books in the trilogy, the author is able to really develop the political, philosophical and emotional aspects of the situation rather than just focusing on the "action."  Katniss is such an interesting character, with tons of depth, and she is only the first in a strong cast of interesting characters. The development and complexity of her feelings for Peeta (the male contestant from District 12) in the context of the game was incredibly interesting.  Although this is technically a "young adult" book, its appeal far surpasses that genre.
Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The premise of THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins (2008) didn't seem that interesting for me. There was a lot of hype about it. (I'm anti-hype.) But I decided to give it a try anyway. I was surprised. I really thought it would hate the idea of a game of life and death between children. The writing is first person narrative by Katniss. Her little sister's name is drawn to participate in the hunger games. She is protective of the sweet little thing and mindlessly volunteers in her stead. (I would have been the scared sister, not the protective one.)  The story tells of a world that has been nearly swallowed by the ocean. America is under new management and only the land around the Rockies is above water. There are 12 poor districts ruled by the rich Capitol. The Capital maintains control over the other districts who provide them coal, crops, fish and other such things from each area, by forcing their childrens name to go into a drawing each year to participate in the Hunger Games. They draw two names from each district. They are placed in an enormous dome in the wilderness forced to fight to the death--with cameras watching. Children gladiators--a bit scarey.  I anticipated it being gruesome and it was but the main character is genuine and worth the time invested in this novel. It reads really quickly but left me wanting more with the cliffhanger at the end. (Don't worry, no spoilers, and it's not what you think!)  I'd rate it at a 4. Very Good: It was a very good choice to read. It was worth the time but the violence was a off the hook! This is a YA Novel but the violence is rather ghastly. But of course, I'm a grown up and I'll be reading the next in the series: CATCHING FIRE.  YA NOTE: This is a young adult novel but has the violence level of a rated "R" movie. They see about as much playing video games. I just thought I'd warn you! But maybe reading it is easier than seeing it on the big screen.  Read more of my Book Reviews on my blog: [...]
Novels with dystopian themes have been popular for generations, and one of the newest, The Hunger Games, is worthy enough to merit a place among the classics. Written for teens, with adolescent main characters, the story will snag and rivet the attention of an older readership as well. The plot is straightforward: the American democratic experiment has failed, leaving the surviving population distributed among a dozen rigidly separated settlements, each region assigned to produce a specific commodity by the elitist, totalitarian government. To discourage rebellion, those in power sponsor the annual "Hunger Games", in which two teens from each settlement, selected by lottery, must compete in a diabolical, controlled wilderness, to be the last one alive. Every moment is televised, broadcasted to the populace, which is required to watch. Katniss Everdeen is one of the "tributes" from the impoverished District 12. A fierce hunter dedicated to keeping herself and her family fed, Katniss has never had the luxury of considering the feelings of others. While she is deeply afraid and reluctant to kill other humans, she vows to fight to the bitter end in the Games.  Author Collins writes powerfully, so vividly that in violence and strategy sequences one finds one's own mind merging with that of Katniss, who is a strong, nearly archetypal female figure. Although only one other character is as completely delineated as she, the reality of the supporting cast members is nevertheless compelling. Collins ramps up the tension early, and never allows it to flag, even at the very end. But be forewarned: The Hunger Games is the first in a trilogy, and the conclusion serves as a introduction to the second rather than a resolution.  Highly recommended.
From adult to teenagers to kids and older people any person would be found reading the hunger games by Suzanne Collins. Where ever I go I find people reading the hunger games or the other two books in this amazing trilogy. If you are the reader who will enjoy a sci-fi/adventure and a romance, much more all in 300 pages of true suspense then Hunger games is for you.  In this amazing story that takes place in the future America that is split up in thirteen districts and is completely corrupted was a girl named Katniss Everdeen who lived with her mother and younger sister. Since her dad, that meant the world to her, died she has to step up and be the man and the one who does everything to keep her family alive. Katniss hunted every day with her love gale. But when the day that the capitol decides two kids that are twelve to eight teen from each of the 12 districts ( I told you there was a thirteen but the capitol bombed it, in the other books there is a lot more about it) the boy that was decided was katniss's age though she really did not know him that much but she had one special memory about him and how he gave bread to Katniss when she was looking in his garbage, his families bakery, and though he did this he got really hurt by his mom. What do 24 kids do at the hunger games you still is wondering, they fight and kill one and other. And why. The last person standing gets food, water, oil, shelter and more for his/her district. Guess who was chosen for the girl was chosen....not Katniss.... Prim Katniss's sister. Katniss knew she would die easily so she takes her little sisters place in the hunger games. Watch Katniss as she survive the hunger games and works together with others as she falls in love. Something you can learn from the book is how to fight for what you really think is right. It is mainly about the whole series.  I feel that the fun part of the book of the book is one the idea of the story, how kids compete and they need to survive to get food for their district, is really a smart idea. Then the characters are fascinating. Katniss is a girl who is the man of the house and is so outgoing and is dedicated to save her family, and then you have gale who loves Katniss and Peeta who loves Katniss and then Katniss needs to decide who to love throughout the whole series.  If you're looking for an action-packed book filled with adventure, deception, and combat, The Hunger Games is the book for you. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic North America, where 12 districts surround a magnificently built Capitol. The Capitol is cruel, corrupt, and heartless, and each year orders one boy and one girl from each district to fight in the Hunger Games, a competition that forces the players to battle to the death until there is someone left standing... just to remind the districts that the Capitol is more powerful than then and that if they tried to rebel, they would be destroyed just like the players in the Games.The last person standing's district will be showered with food and gifts for the rest of the year.  Katniss Everdeen lives in District 12, an extremely poor district that is always struggling with starvation. Nobody has won the games for the past 14 years there, and as a result it is completely ignored by the Capitol. Katniss feeds her family by hunting in the woods that surrounds her home, and is very skilled in hunting. So when her name is drawn to compete in the Hunger Games, she is ready to kill. At first, she slowly dispatches her enemies, but as the Games progress, she begins to realize her real enemy isn't any of the players, but the Capitol itself. She then devises a plan to prove that she is something more than a pawn in the Capitol's Games and that she doesn't have to kill everyone to be a victor.  The entire book has an amazing plot and describes the landscapes that Katniss encounters perfectly. In the first person and in present tense, the book also beautifully captures Katniss's emotions, and you can easily understand what she's feeling and why. The book has many themes, from action to romance to betrayal, but all of them find a way to fit in too a magnificently sculpted book. In addition, the sequels Catching Fire and Mockingjay are even better than the first book, so if you like The Hunger Games, you'll love those titles.  Overall, The Hunger Games is one of the best books for young adults I've ever read, and I'm certain that any reader will love it.  Another review of the hunger games by John feffert  The Hunger Games  This book is a MUST read book. What Suzanne Collins has put into this jewel is amazing. I think it is a perfect young adult read for ages 12-18 for those looking for a great book.   This book takes place in the future, where North America is in ruins. A dreadful dark period started, known as the dark days, where the citizens of the 13 districts revolted and started a war. In the end, the Capitol (the government's only city) won and took over power. To punish the districts, the Capitol created an annual event called, the hunger games, where children fight to the death. Every district sends in 2 tributes into the hunger games. One male and one female.   Kattniss Everdeen lives in district 12. This year, she was going to the games, as a tribute. Soon Peeta, her partner tribute, reports to the public that he is in love with her. Now she has to play a lover role. Now that the games have begun, she is forced to give up that role. Will she have to kill him? Will she die? Only one person will come out alive.  "Let the 74th annual hunger games begin!"  Next to Percy Jackson and Diary Of a Wimpy Kid this is one of my favorite books. It is truly well written and is just such an amazing book.  READ IT!!!!!  By John Feffert  another review by john smith  The Hunger Games  The book the hunger games is a great book by Suzanne Collins. It has lots of action and breath taking cliff hangers. If you are in the mood for some action go and get yourself the hunger games.   The book is about a girl named katniss who lives with her younger sister named prim and her mom. They live in district 12 out of the 12 districts and every year they have the hunger games. 2 people from each district get picked to be in the games. The hunger games are a fight to the death in an arena between the tributes. The last person alive in the arena is the winner.    My opinion on this book is that it is great. I think it is one of the best books. I like it because it has a lot of action and I am a big fan of action. Also the author makes you feel like you're actually there inside the story. I was just so attached to the book and could not put it down. So if you like action, go out and get yourself the hunger games!
At this stage, there is little that I can add to the discussion of the immensely popular "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins.  Conceptualized and released under the "young adult" banner, Collins' novel has found widespread acceptance and acclaim across all age groups.  My two cents is that I just want to get on the bandwagon!  I am NOT the typical reader of young adult titles, but having heard these books discussed so frequently of late--I thought that I'd satisfy my curiosity.  What I discovered is that "The Hunger Games" is an absolutely riveting tale of survival set in a cynical dystopian future.  Bleak, violent, and relentlessly paced--"The Hunger Games" is a pulse pounding entertainment that will have you plunging through the pages.  Filled with compelling characters, the novel introduces a society separated into different districts.  Each year, an elaborate tournament is conducted in which youthful representatives from each area must battle to the death for a televised audience.  Both disturbing, and surprisingly believable, Collins never shies away from the brutality of her plot conceit and delivers suspenseful and sophisticated satire, social commentary and all out warfare.  At the heart of "The Hunger Games" is a compelling heroine--Katniss Everdeen.  Katniss becomes an unlikely rebel and audience favorite through her wits, physicality, and just plain stubbornness.  But can she make it to the end?  Can she be the heartless killer necessary to survive?  I loved "The Hunger Games" and have picked up the other books in the series as well.  A terrific surprise, this is a book the adults don't have to be embarrassed about reading!  Collins scores big points for creating a world that is scary and not downplaying the viciousness necessary to pull out this type of competition.  But she also does so while keeping integrity and hope alive.  A great balancing act--a wild and fun ride!  KGHarris, 10/10.

The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a book I never thought I would be interested in reading. Yet I found myself caught up in the story and towards the end I couldn't put the book down.  This book is set in the future, after the destruction of what we now know as America, due to natural disasters and non natural disasters.  Out of the remains of the old world a  new world called Panem arises which consists of The Capitol and 12 (used to be 13 districts).  The districts are kept in line by the mighty hand of the Capitol by Peacekeepers and electified fences and the annual Hunger Games.  As a reminder and punishment for an uprising/rebellion almost 3/4 of a century earlier each district is to send one boy and one girl "tribute" to the Capitol each year where they will fight to the death, with only one Victor.  The book begins on the day of the "Reaping"-the day where the tributes are chosen at random-and we are introduced to the main character, in whose voice we read the entire book, Katniss Everdeen.  We follow her as she volunteers as tribute and journeys to the Capitol with her fellow District 12 tribute Peeta.  I really did find myself connecting with the characters.  The author brought them to life for me.  Even though I had a hard time at first reading it in the voice it was written in, I got used to it.  I really thought it was going to be filled with lots of bloody battle scenes, but even though there were a few scenes that were a bit graphic and gory, the remainder of the time in the actual arena consisted of quite a few lessons on survival skills as Katniss kept to herself in order to stay alive, utilizing the skills she learned while hunting illegally in the woods behind District 12.  There were a lot of twists in this book enough to keep the reader on his/her toes and it made this book very hard to predict, keeping the suspense level just right to keep the reader reading just a little bit more, a little bit more.  The author kept the plot flowing perfectly.  Not to mention the surprise ending.  And while there are those few scenes that might bother the faint of heart, I was really pleased to find no foul language in this young adult novel.  The author has quite the imagination and was able to bring this future fictional world to life in all its horrors.  Oh, and there is a bit of a love story being told here which is extremely important to the plot.  This book is definitely a 5 star book.
I first heard of the Hunger Games on website that I am member of. It's one of those websites that let people swap books with each other. I didn't give the book too much thought except for the fact that a lot of people wanted it. As coincidence would have it I was at my local library looking through the take a book leave a book section and Hunger Games jumped off the shelves at me. At first, I was thinking that I would just trade it right away for something that I wanted to read. However, that night I got bored and started reading.  The book is told from the perspective of Katniss, a scrappy and spunky sixteen-year old girl, from the poorest of the Districts. The story is set into motion when Katniss takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games.  The story behind the Hunger Games is that every year two names (a boy and a girl) are drawn at random from each of the 12 districts in a mythical country called Panem-The back of the book says that Panem was once North America, but the reader never gets that feeling because the author has neglected to add in any details. It could be a version of America in the future or it could be a different place on a different planet- to participate in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a punishment by the government imposed on the districts because of a rebellion that had happened many years before.  The point of the Hunger Games is to be the last one standing. Some people may find it disturbing that only kids 12-18 are in the games which means that the games involve children killing children. It's almost the same theme as in Battle Royale. However, Battle Royale was a little more violent and more political. Not to fear though even as violent as the backdrop is there is very little violence and when there is Suzanne Collins, the author, has seen fit not to describe it.  It's a quick read; two sittings and I was done. That's not a bad thing at all. It's just that the Hunger Games is not what I would call a "deep" novel. Yes, the characters are pretty well developed and so is the story. However, most of the "young adult" novels that have come out in the past decade (Harry Potter, Twilight) are short on description and use short bare bone sentences. For example, if Panem was once North America it would have been nice to have seen something that was associated with America; a busted up part of an interstate or buildings that had fallen into ruin or even myths mentioned in passing would have been nice. But because the writing is geared towards young adults you don't get a lot of details. Your average adult reader (even a lot of younger readers) can fly through the book.  You won't get any intellectual stimulation reading Hunger Games, but if that's what you want I recommend you read Camus.  The only real complaint that I have with the Hunger Games is that Collins switches tenses in the middle of pages. It throws the narrative off jumping from past and present tenses mid sentence, but you can get over that pretty quickly. It doesn't happen too often (though some people would say once was too many) and considering the genre it is not enough to slam the entire book.   It's not every day that you pick up a book, almost on whim, and find that you have found a little treasure. I was entertained and finding myself rooting for Katniss, even though you know she is going to make it to the end of the book. At times it was hokey, like when it was announced that there could be two winners and not one because Collins was trying to develop the love interests in the book, and silly. All and all Hunger Games is a good book.   I am not in a rush to go out and find the other books in the series, but if I came across them I would have no problem continuing the adventures started in the Hunger Games.
Firstly, if it were possible, this book would be a four and a half star review. It lost half a star due to the ending feeling rushed and I dislike that in a great book that you're immersed in, otherwise, it's deserving of a five star review and here's why.  The Hunger Games is the most unique concept thought up that I have ever read. Who would think that culling your children for sport would ever happen, yet when you think about it, look at the world - child soldiers anyone? However this is more big brother meets survival on your television screen. This concept could be gory, yet with death scenes the author shows compassion and grace, after all, it's not like anyone volunteers to be a tribute representing their district in the games, unless you're saving a member of your family.  Heartwarming probably isn't a word you'd use given the topic, however Katniss, our leading lady, shows such humility to her fellow tributes that she becomes a district wide hero, and that then makes her a governmental enemy. How dare she have everyone liking her. It's supposed to be entertainment, not a show of mercy and compassion. Yet it's these small gestures that make the book real. How can she kill someone that is just like her sister and not be affected? Assuming she does... And of course such actions bring repercussions. Breaking the rules brings consequence.  You cannot read this book without being part of it. Without wondering how their parents are thinking as they watch their children die. Without wondering what horrible theme is going to be set upon the tributes in the games. It's certainly not an honour to win, after all, that means you've survived where as 23 others haven't. Their mentor - a former tribute winner - is now a raging alcoholic. This is what the games do to you it seems.  There are political plans, romance, family, and a huge dose of do whatever you must to get you through, and there are gory moments yet they don't read as some horror gore, they read as survival, with respect. Props to the author for such genuine writing and for creating characters who are so real, with brains, hearts, individual talents, and filling the book with humanity - giving the world, our world, a taste of what we could become, and probably are, like.  The hunger games was well written, compelling, intelligent, unique, and I couldn't put it down. As I said, my only irk with it was that the ending was suddenly rushed and to me, didn't fit the pace with the rest of the novel. But don't let that stop you. This is one worth reading.
Set in a futuristic society, this book centers around a 16 year old girl named Katniss who lives in one of 12 districts surrounding a control obsessed capital named Pandem. Each district has a specialty in production, but most cannot reap any of the "fruits" of their labor as everything is claimed by the capital. Katniss keeps her family alive with the help of her friend Gale by hunting outside the district's fence, an offense that warrants an immediate death sentence if they are ever caught. The book starts on the day of reaping, the day where the capital chooses two of each district's children to fight to the death in an arena. By some cruel twist of fate, Katniss's little sister is chosen. Katniss immediately takes her sister's place and has no expectations of survival, as the games show no mercy.  Katniss has many flaws, but it is her underlying strength that captivated me. I admire her courage and determination to survive, which started long before she was thrust into the games. Her depth is amazing as she can be quite selfish at times, but the epitome of selflessness at others. I hated to see her make decisions always in a calculated manor rather than allow herself any emotion. However, this just shows one of the many consequences of survival in such a society. The will to survive at all costs can be such a nasty thing that twists and changes people. The phrase "kill or be killed" just doesn't seem to be quite accurate. Even if someone kills for their own survival some part of you dies anyway. It will irrevocably change them.  I wasn't going to review this series because the book blogger community is seriously overloaded with reviews on the series. However, after reading the books, I've decided that they really do warrant an opinion. I've always enjoyed dystopian books, with some of my favorites being George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and surprisingly considering the story centers around the burning of books, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Now, I'm not sure if I can really say if The Hunger Games is truly up to the caliber of these books as I have not read them in years, but it did remind me of them. That being said,  The Hunger Games is dystopia at its best, or worst depending on how you look at it. I'm not sure why these type of books suck so many people in, myself included, but dystopian books always seem to cause a stir. Perhaps it is that small part of ourselves that would wish for a utopia and these books show the more likely outcome of someone trying to create such a society.  This book was shocking, graphic and shows the cruel side of human nature.  It will suck you in almost from the first word, and is probably one of the most thought provoking books I have read in a very long time. You will find yourself rooting for the characters even though they are in a hopeless situation. It is definitely a must read!
This book was recommended to me. After reading several reviews decrying the authors lack of originality, I decided to give it a whirl because I'd never read or even heard of the other books with which Collins was supposed to have plagiarized herself.  Anyone who has the sack and drive to write a book and put it out there for the world to critcize has my respect because most of us wouldn't even make the attempt.So I will not review this book based on her  alleged lack of creativity or compare it to any other work becaue quite frankly, I can't speak intelligently about similar works because like I said, I'm not generally a fan of the genre or author.  With that said: It was a very pleasant read. Many of the character were very underdeveleloped so I didn't feel any great loss when they died. I didn't experience the same grief I did when Fred Weasley or Remus Lupin were suddenly and irrevocably ripped from my life (OK! Just one comparision to another book about resourceful kids. I won't do it again!). The Peeta character is of course, adorable, but I got a little sick of him being such a burden even though his unconditional love of Katniss makes me love him more than I can explain.  I eventually reached a point where the "super heroishness" of the female lead became unbelievable to me. I'm a big fan of the strong-willed, ass-kicking, self-sufficient, bow-and-arrow-wielding woman, but does a strong woman always have to mean a weakened and ultimately hobbled man? Even Haymitch, who is supposed to be the mentor and secret weapon is a hopeless drunk. The only man worth a damn is Gale, who's (even though I know he returns in full force in later books) character is dampered right at the beginning. As for Cinna &lt;tear-sniff!&gt;, you can't say a word against Cinna. He is BRILLIANT (keep reading) but with the personal stylist profession and golden eye make-up, I can't help wondering if the author purposely feminized one of the only really likeable, solid male characters to maintain the feminist vibe. Even her father, who seemed to be otherworldly in is heroism is dead before the book starts and only serves as an unseen "Spiritual Sensei" who taught her everything she knows and inspires her from beyond the grave.  All the other men are stupid, burdensome, worthless or savage. All the women are strong, resourceful, sweet, gentle and intelligent. Her mother falls apart a bit but she is still a well respected healer. Prim seems delicate but she show signs of being very resourceful and a gifted healer as well (keep reading). Even Effie is narcissistic and self centered, but she's smart, efficient and well put together.  This was just my view of the book and by no means dampened my enjoyment of it. I really liked it. I will complete the series and when my children are older, I wouldn't discourage them from reading it. It shows how children are strong and can do great things when they have to.
NOTE: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.  Normally when I get accosted in book stores by women older than me raving about a young adult book they've recently read (and I mean raving, she couldn't stop), I usually nod and carefully inch my way backwards scanning for nearby exits. That was the case with The Hunger Games. Needless to say, I didn't immediately buy the book at Barnes and Noble, and got the heck out of dodge. A few days later, scrounging around for something different to read, I came upon The Hunger Games, so I purchased it. Boy, am I glad I did. I finished that book in 3 hours flat. It was different for sure. It was exciting. It was heart-pounding. It was sweet. And it was good.  Suzanne Collins is a solid writer. The language flowed well, especially after the first tenth of the book which didn't really grab me initially, and at times I really got pulled in by the descriptions of the territory so much so that I had to go back and re-read little things I missed on the previous page. I'm also a chronic speed-reader, so I'm sure that didn't help when I got engrossed.  The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic future where there are no longer U.S. states but twelve districts surrounding a Capitol in a country called Panem. The Capitol is full of excess and gluttony and wealth, while each of the twelve districts has to fight for basic necessities like grain and water and oil. District 12 is the last district, and is the poorest. Each year, as a punishment for a prior rebellion of the districts against the Capitol, two young people (one boy and one girl aged 12-18) are chosen from each district to fight to the death while it is all broadcast on live TV. If you're like me and are thinking of The Condemned, a 2007 film, where a bunch of death-row convicts are placed on an island and have to fight to the death streaming live over the internet, with the winner getting a free pass out of jail, I will tell you that it was quite similar in concept. Even down to the sponsors of the event sending floating parachutes with weapons or food to the combatants to give them an edge.  The big difference of course is that these are teenagers fighting to survive. But conceptually, it is pretty much identical. The main protagonist is a girl called Katniss who is headstrong, clever, protective of her family, hostile yet compassionate, and multi-dimensional. She is fierce, and she had me at hello. When her little sister's name is drawn in the selection for District 12, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She along with another boy who has loved her since they were children, Peeta, head to the games at the Capitol. As part of their strategy, they are coached to go into the games as a pair (and not traditionally as solitary fighters because there can only be one winner). Not unexpectedly, this connection is what saves them both in the end.  The first thing I noticed once they got to the Capitol was the huge dichotomy between life in the Capitol and life in District 12. One favors a life of indulgence and excess, the other one of hardship and suffering. I thought Suzanne Collins did a great job of communicating this and it was one of the many things that gave added depth to the book. This was a world that I could really sink my mind into.  Once the actual games commence, following an Olympic-style introduction ceremony, it's all about survival and not getting killed. I found myself becoming so tied into Katniss and what she was feeling each second of the day during the ordeal that I could not put this book down. When she was hurt, I felt hurt. When she was sad, I felt sad. Kudos to the author for being able to weave this kind of reader response with such finesse. In the end, after finding and losing allies, almost dying, avoiding some pretty tight situations, and yep, falling for her District 12 partner, Katniss and Peeta make it to the end, and in an unprecedented turn, are declared twin winners. The plot is pretty intricate so I know that I am leaving out a lot of other little plot things here, but that wouldn't be fun, would it? Giving away all the good stuff that makes this novel a keeper? You need to go read it yourself and get lost in this world. It is worth it.  One thing that I loved about this book was that it had a beginning (started a little slow, I have to admit), a middle, and an end. I really cannot stand books that end on cliffhangers expecting you to go buy a sequel to find out what happens. That's not fair to readers at all. That's like watching a movie that ends telling you to "tune in for the sequel." Um, no thanks.  I would rate The Hunger Games 5 out of 5 stars. Great read with lots of cool twists, and solid characters that you can really connect with and feel something for. No one-dimensional Sallies here. The action is literally non-stop, and you will react emotionally to this story even though it's sci-fi fiction. It's gritty and raw and dramatic. I enjoyed it immensely, so yes, an indirect shout out does need to go out to the raving lunatic fan in Barnes and Noble. Thank you, crazy lady, you made my day by bringing my attention to this book.

I'm a 47 year old woman, and this type of book would have been unforgettable to me - when I was a kid.  I remember how "The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe", "Lord of the Flies", "Call of the Wild", and "Boy Caruso's", (if anyone knows where I can find a copy of the latter, please let me know) affected me back then.  I believe this one would have also left a lasting impression on my memory.  I'm drawn towards adventure romance books, and this one certainly has all the makings of those two elements.  Unfortunately as an adult, I found quite a few things keeping this book just short of a 5 for me.  And of course they are only derived from my own experience in life, and completely of my own opinion.  But I'd be curious to know if any of you had thoughts similar to mine.  SPOILER ALERT:  I really enjoyed the set up.  It was wonderfully executed, and made me simply itch to get into the games.  I couldn't wait to see how Katniss would use her skills to survive.  And I was just as excited to see how the romance would play out between her and Peeta.  Especially with Gale at home, waiting in the wings, watching their relationship develop.  All the time loving her, wanting her to make it home, but jealous as all heck - at the thought of her heart bonding with Peeta's instead of his own.  Was she simply pretending, as a strategy to win the game?  Or was she truly falling for Peeta in their desperate fight for survival?  I would have liked to hear more from Gale's perspective.  Oooooh - the entrails of a love triangle!  O.k., so we get to the games... and her first real plight of survival - is that she doesn't have any water?  Surely I'm not the only one who thought.... Why don't you use your piece of plastic, and the concept of condensation, to collect water?  Warm days, and cold nights.  Has no one but me noticed the amount of condensation that collects on grass overnight, in that kind of weather?  Hmmm..... She could have gotten enough to at least wet her whistle..... just a thought I had.  On top of which, she had both run and walked for almost three days, I can't imagine her not coming across water by then.  The river she ended up utilizing, was much closer than a three day hike to the cornucopia.  I loved the pairing with Rue, and Rue being compared to Prim.  But during the whole course of the games, Katniss never once had to really make a tough decision when it came to killing for her survival.  When you think about it, everything worked out perfectly in her favor so she never had to deal with that kind of a choice.  It's not so tough to kill the bad guys, but the good guys?  That's a whole part of the story that was conveniently left out. That's what makes fabulous debate..... the tough choices, the pro's, cons, rights, wrongs, moral dilemma's versus desire to survive - all mixed in.  I would have liked to see the author tackle that during the course of the story.  Katniss is beyond her years in maturity, being that she had to step in as adult and provider - just to keep her family alive over the years.  But when it came to the workings of her mind, on the subject of marriage and relationships, it just didn't make sense.  Surely I'm not the only one who would agree, that bringing children into that world would almost seem cruel.  But I'm sure Katniss could have been written with enough intelligence, to realize that partnering with someone would be much more advantageous; than being alone for the whole of your existence, in their dire circumstances.  Children are a choice, well... unless they withheld birth control from this particular district.  And religious factors were never mentioned.  It would have been good for Prim to have a strong, loving, "boy/man" figure in her life too, after her father's death at so young an age.  Not to mention, the only thing of meaning/value they had to cling to in this futuristic setting, were the people they loved.  So why stay alone purposefully?  I believe this story could have been made into an even more wonderful tool for discussion. Still, I can see why teachers are requesting their students to read it.  In a society where reality t.v. is such popular entertainment, and so many of our systems are becoming Government run, one could have a field day as to where that may be headed next....  I don't find this story to be beyond the realm of possibility.  Although, the mutants they created for the games at the very end - I felt unrealistic.  I mean really?  Did they have magic in the Capitol?  Dead - to mutant creature overnight?  Not to mention, Katniss had already led us to believe that the dead were immediately shipped back home in a simple wooden box.  Hmmmmmmm......  I loved Collins' other creatures... like the mockingjays and the tracker jackets...awesome, and believable creations.  We all have our self predicated desires and wishes, for how a story could be made better, but over all I enjoyed this one.  As a parent myself, I would recommend it for family reading and discussion around the dinner table.
At some point in the future the United States of America will cease to exist. In its place will be a unified North American government. That will eventually be ripped apart by rebellion which will destroy vast swaths of land and leave the people living in 13 districts.  As a reminder to the people that rebellion will never succeed, and a reminder that the Capitol has total power over its citizens, the Capitol has a game every year. The rules are simple--fight to the death.   Such is the story of Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games. Each year two tributes are picked from each district; two children between the ages of 12-18 are randomly picked to play a gladiator style game where the last person alive is the winner. The Hunger Games is narrated by Katniss Everdeen, a 15 year old girl from district 12. Though she is a skilled hunter in the forest, she knows she will not have good odds of surviving, especially when the boy from her district, Peeta, is so much larger than she. She also knows that other districts have tributes who have trained for years to be killers.  Katniss is determined to survive, though. As she tells her story, she reveals that she is distant, emotionally cold, and very calculating. She carefully considers each and every action by how it will affect her survival. Still, she is very likeable and you will root for her survival, even though it means watching her kill other teenagers. The reader, like the characters, has to walk an intense, fine line between rooting for a winner, (while watching other children be murdered) feeling the excitement of battle, (while understanding that it is simply a tool used by the government to maintain power) and maintaining a human connection (even though it is clear that the game must be played).  Katniss is such an honest and engaging narrator that you can't help but be drawn into her world. She tells you the events in the present tense (a remarkable stylistic device) which creates the sense of urgency and speed that will rush you along.  This book is amazing.
I think that I'm the last blogger to have read and reviewed this book but I finally got around to it.  This is technically classified as young adult science fiction but there were some themes that were pretty mature in it and which adults could relate to, perhaps for different reasons.  The setting is the country of Panem. Panem is a fictional country that rises out of what once was the United States, Canada and Mexico.  It seems to be almost a post apocalyptic society in the same way that The Handmaid's Tale was.  The country consists of a wealthy Capitol district in the Rocky Mountains and twelve poorer districts who are known for certain types of industry.  The main character comes from the 12th district - Appalachia - known for its coal mining. There is a 13th district that was torn apart and literally wiped off the map by the Capitol due to a rebellion - it no longer has residents or industry and exists in name only, literally. The story takes place sometime in the future, although we are never told when in the future it takes place. As punishment for the 13th District's Rebellion against the Capitol District, one boy and one girl, aged 12 to 18, from each district is selected to compete in the Government sponsored Hunger Games, which are broadcast live on TV (think Survivor but where the competitors actually die). Each competitor, or tribute, must fight in an undisclosed outdoor arena to the death, until one remains.  Katniss, a fatherless girl from District 12, is the protagonist for this novel. After volunteering to be the girl tribute from her district in order to spare her sister (who is selected), we follow her as she travels through the Capitol and participates in the games.  The major themes in this novel are big government and Big Brother as well as personal independence and freedom, as the government is involved in just about every aspect of their citizens' lives. I wasn't able to put this book down for a second once I started it, to the anger and frustration of my household. Yes, it probably would have gone by quickly simply because it's a young adult book, but it seemed to fly by even faster because it was such a good book. It was entertaining and disturbing and fascinating all at the same time. Very believable and a great read.
My Thoughts:  Wow, what a book. I'm one of the people who jumped on the Hunger Games train very late. I read this book on September 1st, 2010 which is a long time after it was released. It had the dystopian  feel to it so I was unsure about reading it since I'm usually not too into those types. I was so afraid I would be let down after all the hype building up about these books. I was so surprised how much I loved The Hunger Games! We meet Katniss  who is truly an inspiration for girls everywhere. She's so strong, determined, sincere, and has a big heart even though she has to be tough. She is best friends with Gale, who goes hunting with her. We don't get much info on Gale, just that he has a big family and he is the sole provider for his family. We meet Katniss's mother and sister Prim. Prim is just 12 years old. Katniss comes from a very poor family and she hunts illegally to feed her family and trades just to keep them going day to day.  The Hunger Games take place every year. One boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen are called upon to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Of course that year, Katniss is worried that her or Gale's name will be called because they have their names so many times in the draw. But, unfortunately her sister is called and Katniss stands up and volunteers to take her place. She can't imagine her sister making it, or having to try to survive. She can't see her sister go through that. Another boy is called, Peeta. What can I say about Peeta? He's pretty awesome to me. Katniss is vaguely familiar with Peeta, they sure don't hang out with each other and she's just glad it wasn't Gale.  Anyways, they go to get ready for The Hunger Games, and the small interactions between Peeta and Katniss were nice especially when it would dawn on her, she needs to stay away from him since he's basically the enemy. The talent section where she shows them how she can shoot a bow and arrow cracked me up! I actually reread that passage a few times! They go onto The Hunger Games. It starts out simple enough with supplies out in the open and players going after what they want. And, some of the participates band together which is just pointless since only one can walk away the champion. The things they have to endure are painful to watch, painful to feel.  I don't want to give away the whole book. Lets just put it this way, The Hunger Games is wonderful. The trials Katniss has to go through and she never gives up no matter what. She knows back home there are people waiting for her and she must defeat this! She must win.  Peeta was likable at the beginning and by the end I really really really loved him. There has been so much talk about Team Gale and Team Peeta and I guess I do like Gale but I just don't feel much of a connection to him at this point (maybe because he wasn't in book 1 much) and Peeta just made me fall for him. The things he said, his personality, it was all there. Katniss is still brave and I am glad we saw things through her point of view. I really liked a lot of the characters. I really liked Rue. I didn't like Foxface very much. She just annoyed me I guess. The characters are likable, the plot is wonderful, the suspense was awesome, and I found myself happy, sad, crying, mad, hurt, and wanting to throw up throughout the book! Not many books make me feel all those emotions! In other words, hands down it was one of the best books I've ever read!  Overall: I loved loved loved loved this book! Way to go Collins for making me fall in love with this novel because not many books like this do! I started reading this and finished it within a day, I kept telling myself every time I needed to set it down, just a few more chapters than I'll stop! Well, I didn't stop too often! It was so addicting!  Cover: Like it, its simple but neat.  What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes  Taken from Princess Bookie  (Hardcover Edition)
The Hunger Games might not be the best book I've ever read, but it sure is one of my favorites (and for good reason!). The story, technically speaking, has been done before. If you can look past that (I'm sure most of you don't care much about it), you'll find something that's well worth your while.  Read into the story first to see if this is your type of book. Chances are, if you like action or drama in any form, you will greatly enjoy this book. Life in The Hunger Games is essentially a punishment for the rebellion that took place in the past. Now, children between 12 and 18 (I believe) are the victims for the actions of their ancestors. The story is cruel, and some particular scenes are especially violent. Nothing gets worse than PG-13 for those concerned, but don't go into thinking it will be light-hearted at all. This book, if you allow it, can be very, very dark and teases the mind in some disturbing ways. I won't go into too much detail about the events in the Arena here because that's something you need to experience for yourself.  Okay, there are some minor things I didn't like. Collins over-did it with the inclusion of all the romance in the middle of the book. It was too unexpected, and the idea got stale after a while. Also, the fact that nobody in the book bothered to start up a revolution was just mind-blowing. Was everybody that scared? I know the second and third books supposedly include this idea, but did it really take 75 years of watching children kill each other before they decided to stand up? The end of the events in the Arena ends very well, and I'll let you know that there ARE some elements of revolution that happen by the end of the book... but still...  Anyways, this would make for a very interesting book group choice. ESPECIALLY for teens who like reading. You can bring several religious morals and values into it, and then it gets interesting. After you read the book, ask yourself this: What would you do if YOU were in the Hunger Games?  You will lie awake and think about it for weeks.
I purchased "The Hunger Games" because it was the book of the month for an online book club I'm part of. I'd seen it for quite a while every time I went into the bookstore. The minimalist cover with the bright gold bird on the front had a tendency to stand out against stuck-up princesses and styalized characters painted with a fantasy-tinged brush that covered the rest of the shelves. For a long time, though, I walked right by. After all, I'm too adult to read "children's" literature, right?  Wrong!  After taking a young adult literature class in college, I decided to give the genre another chance. After all, other than the classics like "Catcher in the Rye" and "To Kill a Mockingbird", most modern YA literature seemed to have been written about spoiled rich kids or boarding schools.  The Hunger Games takes YA stereotypes and shoots an arrow through it's forehead. Katniss Everdeen is a 16-year-old girl who lives in the United States after war and natural disaster have ravaged the country. The survivors have been divided up into districts, there are 12 of them, 11 responsible for resource production and all controlled by the Capital and a tyranical government body. Every year, in order to remind the colonists of the rebellion against the Capital, one male and one female child are chosen from each district to fight in The Hunger Games where the girls and boys must fight to the death until only one of them is left. The lone victor.  Katniss Everdeen is not chosen, but she volunteers to save her little sister, and in doing so, she lights the world on fire.  I don't want to give too much away because the best part of this book is the adventure and wonder that unfold on every page. Katniss is one of the strongest female protagonists I've ever seen, partially because she is so flawed and vulnerable, but she rises aboves them, triumphs over them, and becomes an unintentional figurehead of a rebellion that's been brewing for decades.  I could easily go on for a thousand more words. I could talk about all the moral questions "The Hunger Games" asks, such as, is it OK to do the wrong thing for the right reasons, or if you're fighting for freedom for the entity that's opressing you, are you ever really free? I could talk about the interwoven tapestry of action, romance, political intrigue, and psychological thriller that makes this into a multi-dimensional page turner. I could talk about the fantastic characters, amazing visual discriptions, and how the words jump off the page and into your heart until you actually care what happens to the characters and you turn every page with trembling fingers because you're afraid to find out what comes next. I could talk about all these things, but I think I'd just rather let you read it instead.
At first I was reluctant to read "The Hunger Games", a novel about a futuristic world where life as we know it does not exist and a sadistic, controlling Capitol governs the 12 districts of Panem, the country that makes up what was once known as North America. But since I like to be in the know and the final book in the trilogy is getting a ton of buzz, my curiosity got the better of me. Once I started, I didn't stop reading until I finished it.  Katniss Everdeen lives in District 12, where her fellow citizens mine coal as their contribution to the Capitol. Katniss, only sixteen years old, lives with her younger sister, Prim, and her mother, a woman who has not recovered from the mine explosion that killed her husband a few years ago. By hunting in the woods with her friend, Gale, and trading to the local merchants, she keeps her family alive and well-fed. The book opens with Katniss attending the reaping, an annual event where two children (one boy, one girl) between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to represent their district in "The Hunger Games". The event pits 24 tributes against each other in an elaborately constructed arena and the games only end when one child is left standing. The games are consequence for previous rebellions and a harsh reminder to the districts that the Capitol is in charge. If they act out, they will become as nonexistent as District 13.  At the reaping, Katniss volunteers herself in place of her younger sister who is chosen to participate. Katniss travels to the Capitol with her fellow nominee, Peeta Mellark, a boy with an unusual connection to her past. Coming from a poverty stricken district, Katniss encounters a strange way of life at the Capitol and although she has grown up watching The Hunger Games on television, participating opens her world to the savage practices of those who rule over Panem.  The action and events in "The Hunger Games" are disgusting, tense, and sad beyond belief, but that's a testament to the author's talent as a writer. Even though the future world of Panem is devoid of many things we live with today, it still contains the loving bonds people create with one another, even under the most dire circumstances imaginable. Suzanne Collins deserves every ounce of praise she has received for the book and I thank her for creating a strong, sensible, brave, and fascinating character in Katniss Everdeen.
Synopsis: The Hunger Games is a game. A televised reality show for everyone to watch and see. A game where the government picks randomized names of two children from each of the twelve districts in the city of Panem.  The rules of the game are simple: kill everyone else or be killed. Only one survives.  Review: Sometimes, the plot is only the beginning of a book. More often, it's the characters that hold up a story. With this young adult book, that's definitely the case.  Although done before, and the plot is not as original or unique, it's the main characters that truly kept me interested. They were very solid characters, likable, and believable. Because of that, it not only made me empathize and relate to them more, it also kept me hooked and interested.  Another big plus for me was the writing and the pace. It never lagged, was simple, and straight-forward; nothing overly complicated or exaggerated. I liked that, because it showed that an author doesn't have to use big, fancy words all the time to create a point. Sometimes, even the simplest of words would suffice, if delivered the right way. I feel like this is one of those books that is the epitome of that idea.  Also, I was really into the book the entire time I was reading it, and literally couldn't put it down. I know, it's a cliche to say that, but that is truly the case with this one. Even when I finished the book, I couldn't wait to check out the sequel. Unfortunately, (or fortunately, depending on how you look at it), this is a popular trilogy so the library did not have it. I was also far too impatient to reserve it, because the number of holds were crazy! So I gave in and bought a copy of it instead. And I really do think it's worth buying. So yes, I do recommend this book. It's a young adult, fantasy/sci-fi/horror-ish novel, and though I usually tend to stay away from that genre, this one made me actually want to read others in that category.  Again, like I said, I do recommend it. So read it, especially if you're in the mood for a really good, intriguing, interesting, well-written young adult book with a really disturbing storyline.
In the future the world is a hot mess.  Nature went berserk and wars broke out, leaving a haven of civilization in North America called Panem.  In the center is the Capitol, which is surrounded by 13 less-fortunate districts.  While the districts provide the Capitol with everything they need, they are also starving to death so they rebel.  The Capitol, having less man-power but more power, squashes the rebellion, completely obliterating District 13, and forcing the other 12 districts to participate in the Hunger Games.  Each year a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen from each district to battle it out in a gynormous state-of-the-art arena which is designed differently each year and equipped with cameras for viewing pleasure.  They fight to the death, the victor being wealthy for the rest of their life, and the winning district getting a variety of prizes and food.  The story centers around Katniss, a 16 year old who is the head of her family, acting as the provider since her father died in the coal mines.  She's a survivor, and illegally hunts outside the borders of District 12 with her guy-friend Gale, both of them keeping their families from starvation.  During the drawing for the 74th Annual Hunger Games, the name of Katniss's 12 year old sister is drawn.  Knowing her sister wouldn't stand a chance, Katniss volunteers to go in her place.  The boy chosen is Peeta, a classmate who once helped her out by giving her food when her family was starving.  Together they go to the Capitol, are given makeovers and paraded around before being set in the area to kill or be killed.  The only problem is, they kindof like each other.  This book is wonderfully crafted, the world is well written, the characters are so real, and the situations are woven just so that it leaves you panting for more when the book ends.  This may be considered YA but I'm 30 and devoured it.  I'm recommending it to everyone teenager and up.
This post-apocalyptic novel is part of a long tradition of dystopic worlds.  Adults are going to recognize a number of the themes from other novels, but that doesn't diminish the fact that Ms. Collins did a  superb job of pulling the pieces together in a new way.  The main character is a girl who is flawed, afraid, and verging on losing her morality.  That's hardly surprising given that she's been forced into the Hunger Games, a series of gladiator-style battles used to demoralize the colonies who once had the nerve to rebel against the capital.  I really enjoyed watching Katniss struggle with her feelings, her need to kill and her reluctance to do so.  Peeta is a little less believable--putting himself into terrible situations in order to advance Katniss' chances in the games, but self-sacrifice and naivete are staples in YA romance, so that didn't distract from how much I enjoyed the story.  The world building really is remarkable.  Rather than dump a lot of information at once, the story slowly lets details slip until we realize that this is America after the fall of the government.  We figure out that Katniss is from a part of the country that has always been impoverished and short on hope, and that hasn't changed.  The way Katniss slowly learns that hunger and discrimination can be advantages is believable and powerful.  The ending is just as ambiguous and complex as the book.  Katniss herself doesn't understand her feelings, and that makes sense considering the trauma she has just been through.  For adults, I think that the characters are going to feel a little shallow just because Ms. Collins has done a credible job of creating ego-centric teens who don't always see past the end of their own nose.  For teens, I think this is going to be a real favorite.  Any reader who enjoyed The Giver in grade school should definitely read this in high school (and then hopefully move on to Brave New World, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, The Handmaid's Tale and all the other more subtle books that deal with similar themes).
As a child, it is safe to assume, we all loved games. And even today we still do. But every child in Panem fears the very word games. They fear The Hunger Games.  Panem is what North America was. What were the 50 states are now 13 Districts. That is, until District 13 decided to turn against the Capitol and was destroyed. As a result The Hunger Games was created to show the remaining 12 how the Capitol is no one who should be taken lightly.  Every year, one boy and one girl from each District from the ages of twelve to eighteen are chosen to participate in the game. They are put into an arena that varies each year and are forced to fight to the death until only one person is left standing. The winner brings eternal glory, fame and fortune to their District. That is, until next year when it begins all over again.  The whole process it takes to get into the games when chosen is so ridiculous. First they give you a whole make-over as if you are going to enter a beauty contest. They then parade you down in outfits that represent your district for the country to see. They next interview you and make it seem as if it normal. To them it is, but to us, all we can think is that the Capitol are sick bastards who need to die.  Most people might think that this is just a book and that it can't really phase someone. But if you have the imagination that I have, you can see, smell and hear everything that happens. You can see the sadness and panic that lay on these kids faces. The chaos that they go through in the beginning, seeing someone die right in front of you. Sometimes just that one moment where they freeze can be their last.  And it might seem a bit childish, but nightmares also came. Imagining myself and a friend in the game, both of us dying and waking up thankful that it's just, after all, a story and nothing else. But reading about a girl getting stabbed through her stomach by a spear does things to your mind. It makes you feel pity and sorrow for everyone.  The novel goes through many things, survival, love, action, drama, life and death. You get to experience it as if you were also in there.  Some might find this book too much to read, but it is safe to say that this novel will teach you many things. One of them being that people are smart and will try to control you.  Only thing you need to do, is outsmart them.  Welcome to the seventy-fourth hunger game, kids.
Hunger Games  by Suzanne Collins   This book  is realistic fiction with an element of adventure. It has been one of the bestselling books for more than a year. Many of my classmates and teachers read it and were debating about the two attractive, male characters.   To get you interested, I will introduce the main characters of this book. The very first main character is Katniss.  Katniss lives in  a country called Panem, in District 12. Her district specializes in coal mining. Her family is very poor In the with Katniss has a far cousin named Gale. He hunts with Katniss for food. Both have black hair, olive color skin and the same gray eyes. He is very popular with the girls and can work in the mines. He is tough. Peeta is the other main character. He is the partner of Katniss for the Hunger Games. He has one important skill for surviving.  And lastly is the drunken guy call Haymitch. Haymitch is Katniss and Peeta's mentor. When he is drunk, he acts cranky. These are the main characters for now but there are  lot more characters in the series. They are all interesting.   The setting is in Panem. It used to be the United States. Inside it  are the 12 districts. Much of the story takes place in the Capitol. Also a part of the story revolves around Katniss' home. But most of the time the setting is the arena.    The plot of this story is bloody with violence because Katniss and Peeta of District 12 had been chosen to fight and survive the battle during the games. Originally, it was Katniss's sister who was chosen but Katniss who was older than her sister asked if she could go in her place instead. As the story goes on, she learned many skills in surviving the battle. During the Hunger Games, it was terrible because many people were killing each other just to survive. The remaining survivor or winner will be rewarded with lifetime- supply of food. But I wont tell you the result.   This book's theme is a mixture of violence and romance. But I won't tell you whose romance it was. Also it has a mixture  of  friendship and family which thankfully brightens the mood despite the killings.
Dear Suzanne,  You don't mind if I call you Suzanne, do you?  I feel like I know you so well already, know the lovely, twisted inner workings of your mind that compelled you to create a masterful creation such as The Hunger Games.  You brought Katniss ("the girl who was on fire") and Peeta to life and showed them to me, and you made me fall in love with them and hate them, cry for them and cheer for them.  You introduced me to the sad world that they were born into, that of District Twelve,  "where you can starve to death in safety." I don't like what you have done to me, Suzanne, leaving me feeling unclean and over-privileged, and then mocking me (that's right, just like the silly mockingjay) with this ridiculous trilogy that I must now read, that I must stop everything I am doing and get my hands on these books.    "The rules of the Hunger Games are simple.  In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate.  The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland.  Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death.  The last tribute standing wins."  What sick and twisted socio-political system could come up with such a thing?  And televise it for all to watch - that's just cruel and wrong and it makes me feel awful to admit it, but... brilliant.  I mean, I don't even like reality T.V., Suzanne, and I certainly would not want to watch your Hunger Games, let alone participate in them, but like a train wreck, I could not, and still cannot look away.  You have left me wanting more, with a need for understanding.  I need to know Katniss, maybe even become her, because she is strong and full of spirit in a way that I long to be.  And in her actions, I see my own need for survival and struggle to maintain a relevance in life, when everything but living and dying has become so trivial.  I need to know that my life has not been minimized into a series of well angled camera shots as I shoot an arrow through another tributes heart, or that my friendship with Peeta is merely a contrived (and possibly made for T.V.) substitute of everyone that I left behind in District Twelve.  And maybe more than anything else, I need to know that Peeta does not lose himself, because he said those fateful words:  "I want to die as myself.  I don't want them to change me in there.  Turn me into some kind of monster that I'm not."  Because if he lost himself, what does that make me?  All of this need - it hurts, Suzanne.  Why did you do this to me?  And will you leave me again, paralyzed with need after Catching Fire?  I have a feeling you will because you're cruel like that, but like an obedient follower, I will be there, waiting patiently for this dystopia and whatever other meager rations of information and emotion that you have to offer me.  I love you, Suzanne.  And I hate you.  Lisa
Somebody suggested I read this book.  They said that if I like sci-fi I should enjoy this book.  So I started to read this book.  After the first page I was thinking, oh my, this is a rip off of Make Room! Make Room!.  But by the end of the first chapter I realized it was more of a dystopia, but I did not know if it was a self-made one like The Giver or one forced on mankind from the outside, like Tripods Trilogy (The White Mountains / The City of Gold and Lead / The Pool of Fire).  By the time I was a hundred or so pages into the book, it was reminding me of The Running Man and Battle Royale: The Novel.  There is really no other way to say this - if you are a writer you need to READ.  That way, when you have an idea you know how to present it in a way that has not been done before.  Or has not been done too many times before.  On top of that, this isn't really Sci-Fi, more like Sci-fantasy.  OK, let us talk about the good points of the book now that the complaints are done.  This is a great starting book for a teen who wants to start reading.  If they can get through the first hundred or so pages, they are hooked.  But only if they don't read a lot of Sci-Fi or books to begin with.  Otherwise they are going to notice all the themes and ideas are as old as dirt and not well presented.  If I had been a teen and just starting to read, this may have gotten five stars.  And when I mean teens, I really mean teen girls.  It has a touch of romance.  Realistic romance.  But also realistic death scenes.  A weird, interesting mixture of dark fantasy and  blood stained dystopia.  I don't know if I will be getting the other books.  I likely will do so, but I fear that, like many other book series, the stories that follow will just not be as good as the first.
It's a good thing I knew there was a Book 2 when I picked up "The Hunger Games" to read. As librarian in a PK-8 Catholic school, I like to keep current with what middle schoolers, at least, are reading. After one of the girls asked for "Catching Fire," Book 2 in the series, I dug out my copy of "The Hunger Games," with knowledge, then, that I was getting into a series.  And oh, what a story! Initially, the title was misleading (to me). "More vampire stuff," methought. Not at all! It's a post-apocalyptic theme, a dystopian setting, and Big Brother and associates all enveloped into a young adult novel with a clever female protagonist pitting wits against the Establishment (in each case only because she is forced into situations requiring such actions).  Katniss lives in Zone 12 (out of 13 in the newly formed country after war destroyed the old one.) Zone 1 is the ruling province and strictly runs a Big Brother kind of operation. At the end of each year one boy and one girl, between ages 12 and 18, are chosen via food gain/lottery to fight--literally--for gains for the coming year for their families and residual effects for the zone. There can be only one winner and 25 dead competitors.  So, Kat joins the competition after an initial substitution halt. Then there's back story to join the reader with the current situation concerning Peeta, the boy who will also represent Zone 12. In fact, one of the advisers plants a relationship between Peeta and Kat to add a love interest to the contest. Without going into any detail, I'll just say that this love interest works far beyond expectations and for unexpected reasons.  As with any young adult novel, hard decisions are made, alliances are formed and broken, and outcome is questionable. Cameras are ubiquitous. If action ceases for too long, BB stirs it up again with awful means. Tricks are rife. There, I've summarized the story without a single spoiler and you, dear reader, won't know what happens unless you read the book.  I will note: There's a nice twist at the end, which leads directly into Book 2. So far, this is an excellent series. How do I know? Because I can't wait to read Book 2 and learn the meaning of the title. Where can the story go from the end of Book 1? I look forward to making that journey to find out.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins Review  Rating: 5 out of 5  Summary:  In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV  Review:  The Hunger Games was brought up to me when I heard it from everyone around online and personally. I wanted to know what was so great about this 'Hunger' book, so when I arrived at Barnes &amp; Noble, I remembered what to look for.  Boy, was I blown away.  The cashier looked at me as I gave her the book to ring up and she grinned. I didn't say anything, neither did she until she beeped the book and said "You're going to love this book! The third one comes out in August!"  I smiled and said "Thank you. I'm sure I will." and went home to read. I read the first chapter with an O for a mouth and fingers assaulted by paper-cuts. I couldn't stop reading The Hunger Games. I know you won't either. 5 out of 5 Stars. This book is a must read for everyone through ages twelve and above. You'll be mighty hungry for The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.  PROS: It is a page turner and will keep you intrigued throughout the whole entire book. The idea is genius, and the writing is incredible.  CONS: Violence of teenagers killing one another. I do not think that it will make you close the book, though, no I do not, but that is the con. Truthfully, the book is one of the best I have ever read, though.  WHY YOU SHOULD RENT/BUY/READ THIS BOOK : Survival and characterization joins together to form The Hunger Games. It is an intriguing novel with heart-pounding scenes. I will not lie to you and say it is four stars, no, this marvelous masterpiece deserves what I give it: FIVE STARS.
I remember the moment when I realized that 'The Hunger Games' was not just a good book, but a great one. It was the moment after the main character, Katniss Everdeen, volunteers as a "tribute" for her district in this year's Hunger Games. She volunteers because her younger sister, Prim, was originally selected. She volunteers because Prim is just 12 years old.  She volunteers because the Hunger Games is a competition to the death.  "I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage," Katniss says. "Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong."  This sums up what I love about 'The Hunger Games' nicely - As a book it is challenging and complicated and so well done from start to finish. There are moments of almost lyrical beauty and moments of shocking brutality, all paced steadily to a satisfying conclusion.  'The Hunger Games' is set in a future where there has been some sort of cataclysm (war or environmental disaster seems likely), and what we know as North America today has been divided into twelve Districts. Each year, every district must send two tributes, one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 and 18 to the annual Hunger Games, where they will fight to do the death in a closed arena. All but one of the 24 tributes each year will die, with the survivor winning a life of luxury.  The premise of the book, and the focus on adolescent relations in an extreme life-threatening setting, reminded me in all the right ways of Orson Scott Card's 'Ender's Game.' In both books, children are portrayed as being as being capable of great calculation, great humanity, and even great brutality when placed in extreme situations. The honesty and the keen observation of the book is one of its strong points.  'The Hunger Games' tells a compelling story with a believable and interesting cast of characters. It draws you in from the first page and keeps you reading, despite the fact that much of it is difficult to face. It's not easy reading about children killing other children, but it is the complexity and the challenging nature of the story that makes it so worth reading. There are not clear lines of good and evil, but only survival, while keeping some shred of humanity intact.  Expect to be drawn into this story. You may not agree with it. You may not condone it. You may feel that all of it is wrong. But you will want to read it anyway, because it's just that good.
My Thoughts: (Please stand back for an inarticulate gush-fest.)  Um, wow. First of all, why did I wait so long to read this?! And second, WHY DID NO ONE FORCE ME TO READ IT SOONER?!  I was absolutely stunned by this novel. What's weird is that this story was exactly what I was expecting, yet not what I was expecting at all. Does that make sense? I knew it was dystopian, so I was prepared for the post-apocalyptic state of the world, or Panem to be exact. I knew there was a love triangle, but what a nice twist! And I knew there would be action. That's where I was a bit wary. I'm not huge on books that center around this one piece of action for the whole story. I am raising my white flag and surrendering. If this is the type of action I have been missing, my heart just broke.  Suzanne has created the world, or the districts, of Panem so that they crawl off the page with this desolate, clawing motion that just grabs a hold of your heart and doesn't let go. At least, that's what it felt like. I had this huge bout of sympathy for the citizens of District 12, namely Katniss, Prim, and Gale. However, as paragraphs passed, my sympathy turned to fierce encouragement. I was reminded how strong they were, how resourceful. Few books have caused me to have this strong of an emotion, let alone an emotion spurred by a setting.  Once in the Arena, my heart turned wholly to the characters. Katniss is a strong, stubborn, sometimes stupid girl, and by far one of favorite female characters in the YA world. I'm seeing an upswing in strong girls as main characters and it absolutely makes my heart sing. Peeta. Oh Peeta. I love him, I hated him, I loved him again. He balanced Katniss perfectly. The other players in the Games were perfect as well. They had just enough back story for me to know whether I should hate them or love them. There was no unnecessary information, and nothing lacking either.  The Verdict: On my shelf of favorites, that's for sure. No book has tugged at my heart strings, made me scream, made me cry, or made me laugh as The Hunger Games did.
Set in a dismal view of the future, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins follows the story of Katniss as she is sent into the arena to fight for her life in a game of survival. Chosen through a drawing created by the corrupt government of Panem, one boy and one girl from each district is sent to the games. The children must fight to the death and the winner is the only one left alive. Katniss must choose between life, love, and loyalty in a story that makes us question our ideas of quality entertainment. The Hunger Games is the first in a trilogy with the final book being released in summer 2010.  Sarah's review:  The Hunger Games is a delicious morsel of a book that leaves me starving for more. Although it is considered young adult literature, the themes of the book relate to teens and adults alike. The story is told from Katniss's point of view and the reader is really able to get inside her head. She is the warrior every teenage girl hopes she will be. The love story that begins to unfold is juicy and enticing and I had to follow up immediately with the second installment in the series, Catching Fire. The Hunger Games is an adventure from start to finish. It's a quick read but will stay on the mind long after you are through. Although the concept of the book seems farfetched, it makes one think about how far reality TV will go and exactly what we consider to be entertainment. Why do millions of Americans engross themselves in shows like Survivor, or worse yet, Jersey Shore? As for me? I'll stick to books like The Hunger Games.  Erienne's review:  Suzanne Collins does a superb job with her first book in The Hunger Games trilogy. Not only is the novel filled with excitement that leaves you not wanting to put it down, it is also jam packed with thought provoking issues such as desensitization and the value of human life. The gruesome death match is aired on television for all to see and the people of Panem are required to watch. While the people in the districts do not particularly enjoy this, those within the Capitol find it intriguing. Viewers cheer for their favorite contender and simply watch while the chosen children kill one another in hopes of being the last remaining survivor. The onlookers within the Capitol hold little regard for who lives or dies while those within the districts are watching for even a glimpse of their representative. While The Hunger Games is a book where you will find love and excitement, it is also a book that will leave you thinking about many of the issues that we encounter today.
When I first heard about The Hunger Games I wanted to read it, but then everyone was reading it, and everyone was liking it, and that scared me. Usually when something is really hyped I tend to pick it apart so much that I can't enjoy it, so I usually just stay away from it. However when I won Catching Fire on twitter, I took it as a sign that I should probably read this, sooner than later. So I went out and bought it, I read it and it was by far my favourite book of 2009.  There is not one bad thing I could say about The Hunger Games, it's mostly (a little less if you consider the Gladiatorial Games) completely creative and unique idea that is followed up with one of my favourite leading main characters, with some of the most fantastic writing. What makes The Hunger Games so unique even when taking in the Gladiatorial Games into consideration is the world built around the Games and their "players". The world building in the Hunger Games is absolutely beyond amazing, other than the fact that where each district is actually located is a bit confusing to me, you can still see them all, and by the end of the book I can almost guarantee you'll even know each districts main source of income. The technology presented in The Hunger Games was in no way available back when the Gladiatorial Games were around, as well as the ever changing arena's the "players" are faced with. Suzanne Collins writes with the ability to keep you on the edge of your seat by giving you little by little, while still giving you so much. I was constantly wondering what was going to happen next, what was going to pop out around the corner, and whose face was going to show up in the sky each night.  Also, as mentioned before I think that Katniss is probably by far one of my favourite female protagonists, ever. She has the ability to be stubborn, smart, strong, vibrant, all at once, as well as flawed, which is something that a lot of authors tend to leave out when writing strong willed females. None of us are without our flaws so it makes no sense to read about a character who is flawless, and in that way you end up loving Katniss even more for her flaws. A big debate among the The Hunger Games and Catching Fire fans is Team Peeta/Gale, and while I have forever put myself on Team Gale, it's hard after reading The Hunger Games to not swear your devotion to Peeta. He is a very kind and gentle person with a strong resolve and a heart of stone, he is the perfect countering character for Katniss, they very much complete each other.  Overall The Hunger Games is an absolute thrilling ride of a completely unique idea, with amazing characters and some of the best writing I've had the pleasure of reading.
This story hit me deep inside. 24 children, one massive arena, one survivor allowed. All for the entertainment of a vast, partying crowd in the post-apocalyptic Capital. Some of the contestants are there because their names were drawn. Some are there because they trained for this moment their whole lives and leaped at the chance to volunteer. Katniss Everdeen is there because she took Primrose, her little sister's, place. Katniss has always been a survivor. Ever since her father died and her mother fell into depression, Katniss has been making illegal hunting/scavenging expeditions into the woods. Now she's promised Primrose she will win the Games. But the real question Katniss has to face is this: is survival worth losing herself, letting the Capital make a monster of her? Does her love for Prim justify closing her heart to everyone else? What about the little girl who's so much like Prim? What about the boy from her own district who helped her when she was starving? Does she have any choice? She can't save them all; the gamemakers have ways of forcing action. And aren't all the others trying kill her too? Cameras are hidden everywhere. The world is watching.  The whole story is beautifully written. The people have wonderful depth of character. The action is both believable and fantastic. But what struck me the most, perhaps, was the portrayal of the masses in the Capital. What is Katniss supposed to think of these frivolous, shallow people who live in opulence while her people starve, who have space-age technology while she hunts with a home-made bow, who can take her to their hearts, scream out her name, weep for her troubles, and then sit down cheerfully to watch her die? What are we, the readers, supposed to think of them?
I will not give a recap of the book as you can read that in the book reviews above.  What I will do is tell you that this is a well written book that appeals on many levels.  It is a suspenseful, fast paced read.  It has compelling, complex characters that are interesting in their own rights.  It raises social and political questions to make you think without feeling like you are being preached to.  I have read some reviews that said that the author uses concepts written about before.  Really, what good book doesn't involve a theme that has already been written about?!  That is an unfair criticism as her story is NOT a rip off of others.  Every story has pretty much been written so when an author makes you feel so interested and engaged in their story that shows talent.  You could make the arguement that every story written is "ripping" some other story off.  There is a level of brutality in the book that will make it unenjoyable to some.  I will say that I am not a fan of brutal books, but everything was handled so well in this one that it did not bother me.  If you read the premise, you will know that it must entail some difficult situations.  The author never puts in anything gratuitous imo.  She doesn't go for shock value and leaves out the sort of details that would have made it unenjoyable for me.  There are some necessary sad scenes but the key word is necessary.  These scenes will make the book unenjoyable to the most sensitive of readers.  But for me, the sadest scene concentrated on the humanity and winning of the human spirit over death.  It also gave you enough hints of a happy resolution to let the horror part of it go.  Most of the deaths that occur, the reader does not personally witness.  Some of the others are so fast that you move on in the story before you fully take them in.  All but the last are not very deatailed or graphic.  Many of the characters that do die are more adult than child and not the nicest at that.  So for most readers, the subject matter/violence will not turn them off of the book.  If you want to read one of the most interesting, gripping, well written books I have read in a long time than I recommend this book for you.  If you can handle NO violence even if handled tastefully then skip this book.  Also if you read books with a personal agenda of bahsing, then this is not for you either. (You know who you are!  You have heard it compared to your favorite book and can't handle that it fairs well.)
Let's pretend for a minute or two that it is the distant future right now, perhaps around 2065 or something like that. The United States of America has been completely destroyed and is now taken over by Panem, a new country divided into districts. Every year comes this big event that is the most watched nationwide (and worldwide) event on TV: The Hunger Games, an event that lasts for a few days and where people have but one objective: to kill each other until they survive. Now wouldn't that be something?  I wasn't going to give into the hype, especially since a lot of the time, things get overhyped and when you read them they turn out to be unsatisfactory as best. Even moreso, I was afraid to read it when I saw the praise from Stephenie Meyer on the front over, seeing as she did the same thing with that godawful book "City of Bones" (It's no surprise, seeing as she wrote one of the most mind-bogglingly awful franchises ever, which would be "Twilight"). But then again, don't judge a book by it's cover. And upon reading the story, I thought it would be a cheap Battle Royale ripoff, which has a similar plot (people kill each other until one is left alive), but I gave in anyways after a friend strongly recommended it. He was practically glowing when he told me how good it was. "Alright, I guess", said I.  I rented this book from the Library yesterday and managed to finish it all in 4 hours (I'm a bit of a fast reader, I can finish a 300-400 page book in a day depending on how good it is). I must say, not since "Q&amp;A" has a book had me on the edge of my seat for the duration of it's page length! I wasn't expecting much, but I LOVED it. Finally, in the age of Countless books with overhyped characters like Edward Cullen and Eragon, comes a book with characters that are likeable and a plot that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I'm not lying, I hated having to put this book down since it's SO GOOD!  Not a single character here is unlikeable by any means. Every character is likealbe. Katniss and Peeta are fun characters, and I thought the sexual tension between them was hilarious! Primrose, who is Katniss' sister, is a very cute and innocent character. Katniss is, finally a strong female character. SHe is not a Mary Sue, she does not mope and whine about her life and she becomes badass in the last chapters of the book. I can envision Peeta as a handsome and quirky character, he was one of the best things about it. Admit it guys, you were on the edge of the seat for him, hoping he survived! And Rue, boy would I love to have Rue as a friend.  This book is definitely not for Children. The violence is infrequent, but when it comes it's very brutal and gory. The final showdown is very intense and well written. The fight scenes are well written, and very brutal- there's quite a bit of action towards the end of the book, which does have you on the edge of your seat. There isn't any swearing too- I'm not a prude, but I thought it was cool how she managed to tell the story without profanity in it.  Another thing about this book that was cool was the fact that it was written in Present tense. This seems to make the story more realistic, especially how Collins creates a sense of urgency in the writing. It's almost like you're watching the show itself. She manages to make it like a movie with how exciting it is, and I sure hope a movie of this book comes.  In short, this was a surprisingly great book, and my new favortie too. Totally recommended for fans of "Battle Royale" and "Death Race"!
I feel like "whirlwind" and "rollercoaster ride" are two very overused phrases when it comes to reviews.  It's thus a good thing that I don't want to use them here, because they are far from describing the sheer awesomeness of this book.  It was more like Charlie's ride in the elevator at the end of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."  It starts going up, and it's interesting and cool and getting more and more exciting.  And just when you think it can't be more awesome than that, the elevator explodes out of the ceiling into an infinite space and new realms of unknown coolness and awesomeness.  In other words, this book was GOOD.  VERY GOOD.  The futuristic dystopian world that Suzanne Collins has created so believable and horrifying that at times I forgot she was talking about a place that doesn't actually exist.  And thank god.  It is frightening and violent and gripping and disgusting and yet you just can't keep turning the pages.  Because even though you know that what comes next will probably make you cringe, you have to know.  This book sucks you in and doesn't spit you out until well after it's over, after you've spent several days or even weeks thinking about what you've just read.  It also manages to contain within all that gore and non-stop action a teenage love story that breaks all norms and doesn't fit in with the typical YA romance.  It is something entirely new and entirely different that fits perfectly with the book and the world and the plotline that Suzanne Collins has created.  I know everyone has already read this or at least read a thousand reviews of this, so I won't bore you by saying the same things all over again.  Just remember this - this book surpasses genre.  It is YA, yes.  It is dystopian fiction, yes.  But oh, it is also SO much more than that.  Be prepared for the game of a lifetime.  Think Battle Royale but less complex and, dare I say it, far more gripping and amazing.
"When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim's warmth, but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. Today is the day of the reaping."  For 16-year-old Katniss (and yes, I really hate this name!) Everdeen, the day of the reaping is a day to dread. Panem, the country that was once North America before natural disasters and war laid waste to it, holds a "reaping" once a year. It is the Capitol's way of punishing the 12 districts of Panem for the "uprising". Each year, the 12 districts hold a drawing that will provide one girl Tribute and one boy Tribute to the Hunger Games. The 24 Tributes are taken to an arena and dropped off. Imprisoned together, it is ever child for him- or herself. There can only be one winner of the Hunger Games, and it is a fight to the death.  Each child between the ages of 12 and 18 is eligible for the reaping. District 12, The Seam, is the coal-mining district. They have only had one winner of the Hunger Games since it started. On the day of the reaping, all the kids are brought into the town square for a televised drawing. But this year, when Katniss' 12-year-old sister, Prim's name is drawn, there is a volunteer to take her place. Katniss is not going to let her sister go to be slaughtered. She immediately volunteers to go as the girl Tribute instead of Prim. Along with Peeta Mellark, the baker's son and the boy Tribute from District 12, Katniss is whisked away to the Capitol.  Because Katniss has spent the last few years providing for her family by hunting in the Seam, she feels she would have a better chance at survival than her little sister. Because frankly, being chosen for the reaping is a death sentence. Other districts have kids that are bred to be winners. But even if she can't survive, at least she has the knowledge that her little sister will be saved.  In a very Shirley Jackson sort of way, The Hunger Games is a glimpse into a terrifying future. In a world controlled completely by The Capitol, people live in fear of what can be taken from them. Even the games themselves are controlled by the Capitol. Each child can have sponsors that give them certain items to help them in the games. And if there isn't enough "action" to satisfy the powers that be, then the Capitol steps in and makes things more difficult for the contestants.  Collins has created a truly horrific look into the future. As a mother, the thought of such an events as the reaping or the Hunger Games makes me a little sick to my stomach. But as a reader and a lover of good fiction, this book is top-notch! Katniss is about as smart and as tough as a protagonist can be. I just fell in love with her. The Hunger Games starts out with a bang, but the suspense doesn't let up...ever! As a reader, you know there isn't going to be a good ending with this one, but Collins never lets you give up hope. From page one, you are immediately sucked in and just can't let go!! I practically read this in one sitting, it was so intense. I just needed to know what happens. Although there is clearly an ending....there is still more of the story to be told. Again, there is a follow-up book that won't be released till the fall. Damn. What is it with me and and the inevitable series reading?? Regardless of that, this is one intense read, and I highly recommend it!!
Suzanne Collins' post apocalyptic world in The Hunger Games and  is a combination of Richard Connell's The Most Dangerous Game, George Orwell's 1984 and William Golding's Lord of the Flies. The main reason this book had such a strong affect as I read is because children are the victims here and it all comes down to survival of the fitness for these poor innocents. Only the strong will survive and it doesn't matter what age you are. If you are weak and can't kill off your attacker before they do you, then you will become their prey, unless you can become the predator instead.  These books are not comfortable reads. In part it has to do because of children killing one another due to a society that suffers under the Capitol, a force no one wants to go against. The Hunger Games begins in the distant future where the United States has been eradicated because of countless natural disasters and war. This end of day scenario leads to a new, darker world where out of the ashes comes even more famine, sickness and poverty. The US is now known as Panem, ruled by the Capitol that in turn rules over the twelve districts. Originally there were thirteen of these districts but because they rose up against the Capitol, they were defeated and the thirteenth was obliterated. Each year there is an event called the Hunger Games as punishment against the districts.  The Hunger Games goes as follows: each of the twelve districts, through a lottery chosen, will send one girl and one boy between the ages of twelve to eighteen to participate. They are called tributes and these twenty-four will be in an outdoor arena over an unlimited period where they must fight to the death. The last one standing wins. They also have to put up with harsh weather conditions and killer animals controlled by the Capitol. This is the Capitol's way of stopping rebellion. Instead of making the adults suffer, stick them where it hurts and make their children suffer instead. And the really messed up thing is that this is broadcasted on television, much like the reality shows we watch and enjoy so much. The ultimate prize is that the victor of the Hunger Games will have a life of luxury for them and their family.  In District 12 lives sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen with her younger sister Prim and their fragile mother who is a healer. Katniss is the glue that keeps her family together ever since their father died. Because food is so scarce, Katniss toned her hunting and gathering skills. If she is found hunting in the woods, beyond the electric fence that surrounds District 12, she will be punished. As the reaping commences, Prim is one of the children picked. Katniss knows Prim doesn't have a chance in winning and volunteers as a tribute. And when the other tribute is announced, Katniss is in for another shock. It is Peeta Mellark, the baker's son. Katniss and Peeta have a history together, one that Katniss wants to forget.  Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol and treated like VIP's. During this time, Peeta figures out how to manipulate the public. You want to gain sponsors while you are in the games, because they will send you things to help you survive. He admits his undying love for Katniss. It seems he has always loved her. Katniss is appalled because she doesn't feel that way about him. Is he lying to gain sympathy or is he telling the truth? And then the games are on.  The Hunger Games is a chilling read. The desperation and horrors that these children and their families go through is sickening. To think that there could be a future like this really made for difficult reading. Every emotion was engaged while I read and I have to hand it to Suzanne Collins for writing a complex world.  Suzanne's world building skills are simple amazing. I could visualize the sights and sounds of District 12 and the Capitol. She also makes sure to show how the family unit and basic human needs are so very important. Most importantly the questions of one's morals comes into play here. Katniss and Peeta are essentially very moral and caring people. But what does one do when it comes down to you and the person you care about? Knowing there can only be one victor and you alone are the one to make this heavy life altering decision can bring many consequences. When backed into a corner where you have to kill others to protect yourself and come out alive, would you be able to do it? Would you be able to live with the guilt of taking an innocent life because of an evil and vindictive higher power that forces you to?  The Hunger Games is very violent. We actually see the children in the games being killed. We see them being tortured. There were a few times I had to put this book down because the descriptive passages were too much to handle. You end up rooting for Katniss and those she ends up protecting in the games. A few tears will find their way down your cheeks.  Suzanne raises these questions and more. The Hunger Games is a book that brings to light so many issues and places it in the hands of the next generation, the children who look at life with an open mind, but through the way society and the world around them acts, they learn some harsh realities. I strongly recommend that parents read The Hunger Games with their children because both can learn so much from this story. Suzanne Collins shows a different side of human nature and works it in such a way where after you finish reading the last page, you will be questioning your own actions and morals.  Katiebabs
Set sometime in the (distant?) future, the U.S. has been replaced by a new nation-state called Panem. Once a year, the totalitarian government demands a "tribute" of two youths from each of the twelve districts. They are sent to compete in the Hunger Games, a gladiatorial battle for resources designed to both entertain and intimidate the citizens.  Katniss lives a hard-scrabble existence in the coal-mining district. She's an expert hunter who illegally poaches with her male friend Gale in the woods just outside their village. After the emotionally trying loss of her father and her mother's complete withdrawal, she is nearly solely responsible for the care of her younger sister Prim. When Prim is selected as the sacrifice, Katniss instantly volunteers to take her place. She and Peeta, the village baker's son, are sent to the Capitol. Katniss feels awful, as she considers Peeta a friend, but quickly forces herself to be pragmatic, hoping that someone else will kill Peeta first so that she doesn't have to.  After receiving makeovers, and enjoying opulence in the Capitol for the first time in their lives, Peeta makes the startling revelation (on-air, no less) that he's always harbored feelings for Katniss. All too soon, they are forced into battle. While most of the contestants pick each other off quickly in a battle for supplies, Peeta and Katniss form an uneasy alliance. Katniss quickly assumes Peeta's declaration of love for her is a shrewd gambit on his part, in a desperate gamble to assure a winning spot for both of them. She quickly decides to "play along" for the cameras never dreaming that his feelings are genuine.  If she does survive, how long will she have to keep up the ruse? And how will she explain this to her not-quite boyfriend Gale back home?  Although I had several moments where I had trouble suspending my disbelief, ultimately, I absolutely really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. It's a great blend of action, suspense and dystopia with just a touch of romance.
This book had me on the edge of my seat and I finished it in one day, but it was only after I put it down that I realized there were a lot of questions that went unanswered and a few writing techniques that annoyed me.  I really think this book could have been better if it was written in the third person. I rarely say that because I enjoy first person narration, but I think, for the type of book this was, third person would have been better. It would have given a more complete picture of this dystopian society. I had a hard time picturing exactly what it was like. I didn't really understand why the U.S. had devolved in the way it had aside from some random explanations like droughts and floods or whatever. It just wasn't enough. I had no idea where the districts were in relation to one another or why the Capitol was so worried about a rebellion. There just should've been more background information. Moreover, third person narration would've allowed the reader to find out more about the various characters and the contestants, but as it stands the reader is only really offered a glimpse into the main character and two other supporting characters. I think characterization could have been more developed.  The pacing in this book was great. I couldn't wait to find out what happens next. The ending was a little bit disappointing and like others have said, the rule changes at the last minute were annoying. This book reminded me a lot of gladiator battles in which the men were subject to all kinds of cruelty. The "muttations" reminded me of lions and tigers being brought into the arena during ancient Roman gladiator games.  Katniss is a pretty good character and it's nice to see a strong female even if she does have some masculine characteristics. I like Peeta's character a lot as well -- he is compassionate, intelligent and kind. I also found myself sympathizing with a lot of the other contestants just because I knew they were young and they were trying to survive as much as Peeta and Katniss. I would have loved a more deeper look into the lives of the other contestants. Honestly, this book is a bit macabre with all the young deaths. In the end, I was a little heartbroken over all the senseless violence. But if you think about it, there's senseless violence everywhere and I guess that's one of the commentaries this book is making.  All in all, a fun and gripping read, but it could have been so much better if it was a bit more descriptive regarding the society, the past, the characters, etc.
I kept hearing about The Hunger Games. On Twitter, in blog posts. People were referring to it with that "Oh my God you have to read this" language that gets one's attention. So I looked at the book's description on Amazon, and it didn't seem like my kind of thing: It's a futuristic YA novel set in a post-apocalyptic North America. The country of Panem has risen from the ashes of a continent devastated by (apparently) natural disasters. Panem is divided into twelve districts, each of which has its own specialty--agriculture or factory work or the production of luxury items. District twelve, in the Appalachian area, specializes in coal mining. It's among the poorest of the districts, if not the poorest, and its people struggle to keep themselves from starving. The book's protagonist, 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, is from district 12. She's been feeding her family for years, since her father died in a mining accident, by poaching in the woods surrounding her community, an offense which could easily get her executed. But her time in the woods has also honed her survival skills, which will prove to be essential.  Panem is a Big Brotherish society, the civil liberties of its citizens severely restricted. Among the demands made by the government is the annual participation by each district in The Hunger Games, a reality TV show to which each district must contribute two children as participants. They're selected in a lottery--the "reaping"--that isn't quite fair: the selection process favors the rich. The winners of the reaping are compelled to participate in the Games, a televised fight to the death in which there are no rules (though cannibalism is frowned on). The one participant who's left alive at the show's end is the winner, and goes back to his or her district a fawned-over champion. If you're looking for antecedents, think The Truman Show mixed with Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery,"  1984 and Survivor and the ancient Greek myth of the minotaur.  The bleak futuristic society aspect of the book was a turn-off for me. I decided I wouldn't be reading it.  Weeks passed, and again I started seeing references to The Hunger Games, comments prompted by excitement over the recent release of the second book in the series, Catching Fire. Again I went to Amazon. Again I thought I wouldn't like the book. But I downloaded a sample to my Kindle. That was about 24 hours ago.  It was immediately apparent from the sample that The Hunger Games was well written. By the end of the sample it was apparent that I would have to read the whole thing. I downloaded the book and devoured it, sometimes having to force myself to read more slowly because I was reading too fast, the literary equivalent of swallowing food unchewed. All of which is to say that the book is for some reason immensely readable. Katniss is a very compelling character: she's smart and motivated by sororal love; she's a survivor. But her character alone can't fully explain the book's appeal. The book never slows down. The evil government that imposes the Games on its citizens is easy to root against. The writing is flawless, at least as far as I could tell while gulping down the story. In particular, the author does an excellent job of describing the complicated details of the Games and the society of Panem so that they're easily digested and don't come across as instructional or out of place. It's a great, great read.  -- Debra Hamel
In the future North America has vanished and a new nation called Panem has risen. Twelve districts are ruled by the Capitol, a tyrant ruling council that uses a yearly competition to keep order among its despondent citizens. Every year one boy and one girl from each district are chosen to compete in the Hunger Games where they must fight to the death. The location is always different, and every year the nation watches with bated breath to see who will be the last one standing.  In District 12, Katniss Everdeen looks on in horror as her younger sister is chosen to compete in this year's games. Before she knows it she finds herself volunteering in her sister's place. Also chosen is the mysterious baker's son, Peeta, who Katniss has always known from a distance. As the competition nears Katniss and Peeta grow closer making the imminent battle for survival all the more complicated. This year Katniss and Peeta will capture the hearts of a hopeless nation as they turn the tables on The Hunger Games and the evil Capitol that controls them.  I am always on the lookout for that one story. You know what I mean. The one that gets in your head and won't go away. The kind of book you want to put in everyone's hands.  A story that has the power to completely mesmerize and capture your imagination. The Hunger Games has done all of that for me and more.  Collins hooks us from line one with the engaging first person narrative of Katniss Everdeen. Through her eyes we learn about this world in the distant future and the turmoil within. This is the kind of character that most novelists only dream of creating. Every turn of the page reveals just a little more about what drives her unquenchable spirit. Katniss may be low on the social ladder, but her compassion and fight for justice lend a majestic quality to this lowly peasant.  If Katniss herself doesn't hook you, no doubt the relentless pacing will. Once the Games begin it is almost impossible to put this story down. Collins perfectly balances action, suspense, and violence throughout the second half of this story. As I was reading I felt like I, too, was watching these Games unfold along with the citizens of Panem and several times I wanted to stand and cheer for Katniss and Peeta and their heroic actions. In the end we are given the perfect amount of closure with a promise of more to come.  The Hunger Games might just be the best novel I've read this year and I am simply blown away by the storytelling prowess of Suzanne Collins. The sequel, Catching Fire, is due out soon and if early reviews are any indication, round two is even better. I can't wait to disappear once more into this fascinating world that has captured my imagination in a way I never anticipated.
After the destruction of North America the nation of Panem emerges, in the middle, a shining Capitol with twelve less scintillating nations surrounding it. In order to remind all of the residents of Panem of the brutal war and the power the Capitol holds, the Capitol forces each district to send a boy and a girl, between the ages of twelve and eighteen, each year to the Hunger Games, a fight to the death, survivor style, broadcasted on live TV.  In the devastatingly poor District 12, lives a sixteen-year-old named Katniss Everdeen. She lives alone with her mother and twelve-year old sister Prim, being the sole provider for their family, making sure that they just scrape by. When the day of the reaping comes (the event where names are drawn for the Hunger games) Katniss herself feels that she has a greater chance of being picked, but never would expect Prim to be chosen. When the worst happens though, Katniss immediately volunteers herself to participate in Prim's place, becoming the girl to represent District 12 in the Hunger Games.  Without even realizing it, Katniss soon becomes one of the top contenders to win the games, as survival is second nature to her. If she is to win though she will have to call upon her keen sense of intelligence and expert survival techniques.  Oh my goodness, this book is jaw droppingly good! Every single sentence left you grasping for more and wanting to turn the page so fast that you have to be careful they don't rip. Everything about the book worked and fell so easily into place that it was absolutely impossible to put the book down.  The plot itself was extremely unique and was filled with adventure that kept you extremely riveted. Even though Panem was a fictional world it was very easy to see many parallels to our world, which I found extremely interesting. Suzanne Collins also made this imaginary world very lifelike and made the events of the games so real that it felt like I was sitting in my living room watching them on TV along with all the other residents of Panem.  Another aspect that really made the book shine were the characters. Regardless of how big of a role the character played they were well developed. Katniss was an amazing and strong character and had a nurturing side that was completely unexpected, but very welcoming. Peeta, the second main character, was a sweetie. He was funny and genuine and I loved how he added the romance element to the story, which in my opinion made the book that much better.  As for the author's writing, it was impeccable. She threw you into the arena and made you breathe the same air as Katniss, Peeta and all the other contestants. She created a fascinating world, using fantastic imagery, which made it easy to picture the beauty of the Capitol, all the amazing outfits the contestants wore, and of course the brutality of the arena. She also created one heck of a cliffhanger with the ending of the book, setting up for the next book (CATCHING FIRE) to start right away.  Overall this was one heck of a book. The author combined a ridiculous amount of suspense, a ridiculously cute romance, and so much adventure that this has easily become one of my favorite books. As soon as I had finished it I immediately wanted to read it again and again and again. I strongly recommend it to absolutely everyone and cannot wait for the sequel
What can I possibly say about The Hunger Games that hasn't already been said by other reviewers out there? I will say that when I first heard of the book, I was a little skeptical, but after reading review after review that gave nothing but praise, I finally decided I had to read it. I picked up my copy last week and finally started into it Monday. Sadly, work interfered with my reading, but despite that I finished it last night. I can honestly say it was probably the best book I've read so far in 2009. It certainly puts a new spin on Reality TV!!  I loved pretty much everything about the book--the way it was written, the characters' names and development, Collins' descriptive portrayal of the people and places, and lastly, the way this first book was wrapped up. Oh my, does it leave you hanging, dying to read the next book! This was another of those books where I felt like I was almost involved in the story firsthand. My heart pounded anxiously as Katniss met various challenges during the Games. I felt like I really knew her and Peeta, the two "tributes" from District 12. The plotting was just great, too. Books like these make me wonder how I will ever come up with something so creative to write about, myself! It's not as if all of Collins' ideas were unique, but put them all together and you have a captivating, adrenaline-pumping, and all-round incredible story.  I could not stop thinking about this book after I read it. Just the possibility of what we could become is mind-blowing; we'd be going backwards and forwards at the same time if we ever ended up like Panem and its Districts. Last night, I was even telling my husband and my parents about this book, even though I knew there was not the least likelihood that any of them would ever read it. I seriously cannot WAIT for the next book, Catching Fire, to be released in September.
There has been so much hype around THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins that I knew I had to read it -- everyone seems to be raving about it! I have to admit that it's not a book that I probably would have picked up prior to associating with some many book bloggers because 1) it's YA and that's just not a genre I read much of, and 2) it's technically science fiction and that's not a genre I usually read either. However, since everyone is so excited about this book, I decided to check it out of my library and see what all the fuss was about. I was more than a little concerned that it couldn't possibly live up to everyone's praise, but guess what? It did -- I absolutely loved this book!  I knew I was in trouble when I started this book on Mother's Day. I probably should have been spending some quality time with my family, but I had to read THE HUNGER GAMES. I simply could not put this book down. And, it's not one of those books that takes awhile to get into -- no sir, from the very first page, I was hooked! I became so caught up in this action-packed, fact-paced novel that I had to keep reading to find out what happened.  The plot of this book is just an amazing story -- 24 kids fighting to their deaths until there is only one remaining. What makes this story is more insane is that the event is "televised" to all the citizens of Panem -- it is a reality show that knows no bounds. While parts of the story seemed a bit like the Olympics, especially the pageantry of the opening cermonies and the special interest stories, other parts were more like the ultimate Survivor show (only this time it was a case of life and death.) From just a plot standpoint, this book was fascinating and there was never a dull moment.  However, there were so many more great things about this novel than just the storyline. I loved how the author developed the characters, especially sixteen year old Katniss. When the story begins, Katniss came across to me as very harsh and bitter -- of course, her father died in a mine explosion, her mother basically shut down, and she was responsible for taking care of and feeding her little sister so I guess she had a right to be a little angst-ridden. I appreciated that the author allowed us to see a gentler side of Katniss when she was out hunting in the woods and talking with her friend Gale. I also saw signs of Katniss' more compassionate side when she sacrificed herself for an almost certain death rather then letting her younger sister compete in The Hunger Games. Had I not seen this caring side of Katniss, I'm not sure I would have felt such an affinity to Katniss.  I absolutely loved how Katniss matured throughout the course of this novel. I can imagine that fighting for your life would make you grow up quickly. Katniss was a pretty real character for me -- a teenager who at times thought and acted like an adult, and other times who was absolutely clueless. I appreciated how she learned not only to trust her own instincts, but eventually learned how to trust others. I also liked how she came to really understand herself and her strengths (and even her weaknesses); and, I definitely think she showed signs of being a "normal" teenager when it comes to her confusion about boys!  In addition to developing the character of Katniss, I thought the author did an amazing job with showing human characteristics -- both good and bad -- in all of the other characters in the book. She created characters who had very real and honest feelings such as compassion and hope, but also greed and anger. I can only imagine how fighting for your life can bring out the best and worst of human behavior.  Another thing I really liked was how Ms. Collins wove so much insight into individuals and society into this novel. She did a great job of showing how discrimination and bias exists among people, and how the upper classes can take advantage of their situation in life. I also appreciated how she showed the effects that war has on a society especially when it comes to the children. Those are just a few examples of the thought-provoking themes that run through this book.  THE HUNGER GAMES is the first in a series, and I can't wait for Book 2 CATCHING FIRE which will be available on September 1st. When I finished this book, there were quite a few loose ends which I'm sure will be addressed in the next novel. And while Katniss did grow up a lot throughout the course of this book, I'm anxious to see what happens to her when she goes back home. She has some unresolved issues from her relationships, and I'm curious to see how she handles them.  There is a very cool website devoted to THE HUNGER GAMES. Even though the site is not geared towards me, I had a lot of fun playing around on it! There are downloadable games, excerpts from the book, and even a message board so you can discuss the story with others.  The only thing that disappointed me about this book is that my daughter is too young to read it. There is some violence and cruelty that might upset younger readers and probably would disturb her. It's not that she couldn't read it, but I think to fully appreciate the book, she should wait a few years. Plus, I'm not really ready to answer some of her questions that are sure to pop up.  I definitely recommend THE HUNGER GAMES to every teen (boys and girls alike) because I'm sure they will love it as much as I do; but I also think adults will appreciate the story for some different reasons. I think this novel would make an excellent discussion book for a teen book club or even a mother daughter book club; and I firmly intend to have our girls read it in a few years. Besides being a great story, there are so many things to think about -- namely, the effects of war on our society and especially our children.
In the future world of North America, now called Panem, 12 districts circle a Capitol in what was formally the Rocky mountains. 80+ years prior the districts had revolted against the Capitol and were overthrown and subjugated. Now the Capitol has devised an elaborate punishment for all in the districts to remind them just who is in charge - An annual competition called the Hunger Games.  The Hunger games is an Olympic like duel to the death. Two tributes, one female and one male, are drawn in a lottery from each district every year, taken to the Capitol where they will duel to the ultimate death. To the Victor of the Hunger Games goes the spoils - food, wealth, fame, and comfort for the remainder of their days. To the loser goes a horrible death at the hands of their fellow competitors.  As this years Repeaing approaches Katniss Everdene, 16, knows that she, and her best friend Gale, has a good chance of being called. Both have entered their name into the drawings as much as possible so that they will receive more food stores for their family. But when Katniss' 12 year old sister is chosen as tribute Katniss steps up to volunteer for her place, a feat virtually unheard of in the competition's 78 years of practice. Katniss is not concerned to win, she's obsessed with survival, and it is this desire that may give her an edge over her fellow Tributes.  Every good thing that you have heard about the Hunger Games is true. It's Dystopian, it's affecting, it's really well written. What you don't hear besides the plot and the bloodshed is that Katniss is an amazing character who really comes into her own by the end of the book.  Almost half of this book goes by before any of the Tributes ever set foot in the Arena where their deaths await and still we feel the journey with every poignant step. I think that is the real strength of this book and, in tandem, Collins writing... that she draws the reader in with very thorough exposition and character development so that by the time Katniss sets foot in the ring she is a force to follow. A force. To be reckoned with.  I lost much sleep to reading the Hunger Games. I've lost even more minutes daydreaming and wondering in between readings. I lost myself totally in this book, and it's been a while since I could call anything engrossing. I cannot wait to lose myself in more of Collins work. She is an author to be reckoned with.
Katniss, whose father died when she was 11 and whose mother emotionally abandoned her, has a competence streak a mile wide. Her priorities have become just to keep her family alive, fed and protected (especially her little sister). However, these self-imposed responsibilities have given her little time for niceties (like kindness and sweetness). She is utterly practical. So, when her sister gets picked in a lottery to be the tribute for District 12 in the Hunger Games (an event similar to that of the gladiators, except for reality television), Katniss volunteers to take her place, where the only way to win is to kill all the 23 other contestants.  I thought this book was pitch perfect, especially the characterization. Suzanne Collins took a character like Katniss, who is not riddled with compassion for those around her and made her an enthralling, likeable character. Katniss still has her foibles: her cut-throat attitude and  how blind she is when it comes to the feelings of other characters, but all in all, I totally understood her motivations and I was rooting for her the whole way. The author, though, put Peeta in to balance out Katniss' ruthlessnes. He was completely genuine and good-hearted without being syrupy. (I loved me some Peeta.)  The plot was excellent. I read the entire book in a day. There weren't any "Man, I wish she would pick up the pace" moments. It was fluid and delicious, surprising and still plausible. It had bows and arrows and knife throwing, fire walls, a hearty splash of romance (but didn't drown you in sappiness) and really smart characters whose logic was sound (I hate it when you read a book and you're more intelligent than the characters because you've come to correct conclusions a hundred pages before the protagonist does). Though Katniss is completely obtuse when it comes to romance, which was a bit frustrating, but understandable considering her survival-inclined cognitions.  The only thing that dampened my ardour for this book was the slightly inconclusive ending. Now, that isn't to say most of the stuff wasn't resolved, but, for those of you who have read the book, I was DYING for Gale's reaction. If you haven't read it, be assured that the second book is coming out sometime in September of '09.  All in all, a fabulous book with a lot of fun. I absolutely recommend it to most people (though some may be turned off because of how utterly ruthless Katniss has to be). You get a taste of what she's like in the excerpt available of amazon's Look Inside. If you really, really hate her from that, don't buy it. Otherwise, add to cart already.
I really enjoyed this book - fast paced, snappy dialogue, excellent storyline development - and as Book 1 of a promised trilogy (Book 2 is due out in September 09 according to Amazon) there is certainly a great deal of potential.  Katniss Everdeen lives in a future where the USA has been divided into military districts of starving citizens, gloated over by a strange "Capitol" which seems a bit like an exaggeration of our modern day society.  Every year, 2 teenagers are chosen from each district to fight in the Hunger Games, which is broadcast as a reality show.  Only 1 of the 24 entrants will win, and they must kill off their opponents to claim victory, and preserve their own life.  Katniss is a character without a lot of depth, which makes a certain kind of sense because as the author recognises well into the book, Katniss' daily life is consumed with hunting and trying to provide food for her mother and sister.  There is little other time to work out the meaning of her life and who she is apart from provider (I am hopeful this will be the core of Book 2).  There is a confusing romance going on in the book, and Katniss' allegiance to Peeta, her fellow District 12 Hunger Games contestant and Gale, her partner in hunting at home.  This is never resolved, which is annoying but again, a trilogy requires certain themes to carry over between books and this is a big one.  Stephen King wrote an interesting review of this book on Amazon (initially for Entertainment Weekly I believe) and he makes some good points.  Firstly, we all know reality tv is evil and Collins isn't the first author to go down that track (King points out he did the same with The Running Man) and to be honest, the whole "reality tv sucks" theme is a bit played out these days.  Secondly, he accuses Collins of some "lazy storytelling" which refers to never mentioning the actual cameras, although Katniss is filmed at every moment and knows she is being filmed and also whenever Katniss really needs something food, medicine etc, it is parachuted down to her in the game by a "sponsor".  I know from reading King's "Writers on Writing" that he is particularly harsh on lazy storytelling (understandably so) whereas while I see his point, it wasn't something that bothered me at the time of reading.  I'm not a fan of the "nuclear fallout" books (mind you, Collins never actually says what happened to cause the breaking of the USA) but I did enjoy this one.  I'll leave it a while before I pick up book 2, but I do want to know what happens when Katniss gets home and where that darn romance ends up!
I'm not going to bother re-summarizing the plot here because other reviewers have done a good job of it already. Just a warning, there is a tiny spoiler in the two last paragraphs.  I refused to read this book for a long time, convinced I would hate it. My reason for this was twofold, firstly, the plot sounded suspiciously similar to Battle Royale and yet I never heard the author say anything acknowledging that she was influenced by it so I was annoyed at her, thinking "How dare she not give a nod to her predecessors?" so even though I absolutely love stuff like Battle Royale and Survivor, I gave this book a pass. The other reason was because Stephenie Meyer recommended it (if she recommended it, it MUST be horrible, right?) but as it turns out, I was wrong!  I was literally trapped, held hostage in my bed with this book, hungry and thirsty alongside of Katniss because I was so wrapped up in the damned thing I couldn't even stop enough to go to the kitchen and grab something!  I've gone through the bad reviews most of which cite the Battle Royale thing (at this point I'm willing to give her the 'no idea is truly original' line because she put her own twist on it and really made it unique.) or the idea that the story lacks the ability to create a feeling of suspension of disbelief (OH COME ON, AND BATTLE ROYALE DOES??? Really now! I'm the person who wanted to give an author a 1-star review because she had to nerve to write that there is a Dunkin' Donuts in LA, I think this book did alright considering we are all meant to go into it knowing that it's a YA fantasy dystopian-future sort of book. Do you seriously need a whole historical essay on HOW this society got the way it is and how the Hunger Games relates to this? No. Just take Katniss's word on it that the Hunger Games are there to break the spirit of the people and remind them of their place.  SPOILER : Anyway another reviewer said that there are "zombie werewolves" in the book. There aren't! they are just genetically mutated wolves (with an interesting twist I won't reveal) they are definitely NOT zombies or werewolves! There are genetically mutated species throughout the book so the wolves are really not a big shock at all.  The only reason I'm giving the book 4.75 stars instead of 5 is because I wanted the ending to be longer. i don't want to wait until the next book to see what happens next! I also want to know what happens with a certain gift someone gave Katniss and i was disappointed that that too will have to wait for the next book.
If I begin to rant and rave like a madman, please excuse me for I happen to be very, very upset for having read this book right now. Let me explain. I bought The Hunger Games a while back and put it on my TBR pile (which is admittedly huge). Having finished second round revisions yesterday, I decided to treat myself and read a little before going to bed at 12:30. First mistake. I am a fast reader but it wasn't til 4AM that I finished the book. There were sections that were so intense I had to reread it right then and there. Second mistake, I drank a huge glass of water before starting. Even though I had to pee really badly, I could not put the freaking book down and go to the bathroom. I can't believe I risked a bladder infection for this book. But then again, I can't believe how awesome this book is.  And that goes to the crux of why I am so raving mad that I read this book right now. Cause when I got to the end of the book, it said "End of Book One" and I had no Book Two to immediately begin reading. And that is absolutely killing me. It is exquisite agony that keeps me thinking over and over about pertinent parts of the book. I am amazed at the skill and tortured by the wait. I desperately wish I had not read it until the whole series was written so I could read them back to back. But I also wish Ms. Collins would hurry up and write as fast as possible so as not to hold me hostage by her world much longer. My most desperate wish is one I think all writers have when they read a book they love. I wish I had written this book myself. I wish I had created this world so I can control the outcome of these characters.  For those of you who may not know about this book, I'll give you a short synopsis. Ms. Collins has created a dystopian Utopia where twenty-four teenage contestants representing their districts are forced to compete in the ultimate Survivor show. You must kill the other contestants to win. The rules? There seems to be only one rule - make it entertaining. It reminds me of that great scene in The Gladiator where Russell Crowe comes out and kills ten men in a matter of seconds and the crowd is stunned silent. He turns to them and shouts "Are you not entertained?!" Oh yeah! The producers of the show don't like it when contestants aren't killed daily so they do dangerous things to add to the suspense and keep their audience entertained. The hero of the book is Katniss, a poor girl with mad hunting skills, from the poorest district, whose little twelve year old sister's name is pulled from the lottery. Katniss knows her sister cannot survive and volunteers to go in her stead. And from that moment on, the book takes you on a roller coaster ride that you physically can't get off until it rolls to a satisfying end. Except it isn't satisfying to see that there are more books to read but they are not yet published.  The sequel is out in September. I seriously can not wait!
I really really like this book. I mean really. It is not the most stunning and emotionally wrenching thing I've ever read, but it deserves a 5-star nonetheless. I am a teenage girl, and there were parts of it that most definitely were aimed at my age and gender, but for some reason boys like the Twilight books so I wouldn't be surprised at all if my male friends liked this book as well. It is pure YA: no moody, complex reflection on the human condition, just fast-paced storytelling that leaves the thinking to the reader. It is written to make you want to turn the next page, and frankly there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  Collins made an extremely complex character believable. Katniss is straightforward, yet knows how to lie and double-cross, she is a hardhearted survivor who goes mushy at the sight of nasty cuts and has a soft spot for children. Ultimately, Katniss is a young girl thrown into a heartless world, and she adapted while still retaining the ability to love. Selling that character is a remarkable bit of writing.  About the love in this book: it was refreshing to see a girl heroine who isn't obsessed with love. She obviously has some feelings for Peeta and Gale, but she really isn't too torn up about lying to Peeta to win the games, and she doesn't really think about Gale until he comes up paranthetically. Her reaction to her difficult love dilemma isn't "Oh Gale! O Peeta! Oh what shall I do?" but rather "Oh. That. Whatever, survival first." The typical roles were reversed, the woman fought for her life and protected her beloved while the man blundered about, messing things up, attempting heroism, and following his lady like a puppy. I love Peeta, he's vulnerable and sweet yet determined and tough (for a city boy), but he is absolutely not the dominant force in that relationship. In fact, it's almost a complete role reversal of the most popular of all teen love stories, the Twilight novels.  About the things other than love: fantastic suspense, exciting adventure, and a futuristic world that is only a few disturbingly small steps from ours. Some futuristic worlds are highly doubtable: the world is not going to go up in flames, nor will Vulcans fall out of the stars and help the earthlings create a happy, peaceful United Planets sort of deal where the people who resist having civilization shoved down their throats are hunted down by the ruthlessly diplomatic Captain Picard and his cleanly dressed crew on a disturbingly snazzy and well-armed ship. I know, I know, I want replicators and phasers to exist too, but that is a rather unlikely future for humankind. But Panem, a dog-eat-dog (more like teenage-girl-eat-dog-rabbit-squirrel-and-whatever-else-she-deosn't-feed-to-her-starving-family)world, ruled by a sickly materialistic and ruthless capitol whose inhabitants are clueless to its corruption while the rest of their world starves...not so unrealistic.  SPOILER: A thought for the future of the series. Why was there nothing of Katniss's father left to bury? Why did Cinna ask for District 12? Who is the redheaded girl and why was the Capitol chasing her? Just a thought. I think this book - The Hunger Games - will be to the rest of the series what the Hobbit is to the Lord of the Rings series. A self-contained beginning that serves a piece of an even bigger puzzle. I'm very excited.
I confess I wasn't wild about the prospect of reading "The Hunger Games", a novel where the central trope is an "ultimate sport" type 'arena of death on television'.  This concept didn't sound very original to me.  Suzanne Collins transcends the limitations of the genre by creating a fierce and believable 16 year old heroine in the person of Katniss Everdeen and situating her in a well realized world of subjugation and deprivation that feels very (extremely) in touch with real world relevant issues.  Then she attacks the narrative arc she sets up with terrific verve and pacing.  This is a compulsive page turner.  I read this entire novel in 4 sittings over a 2 day period (and only because I was extremely busy).  It was one of those books you hate to put down and eagerly plan when you can next pick up.  Collins' narrative brims with implied relevant social commentary.  There is political and economic subjugation leading to rebellious feelings in the countryside.  There is rampant economic inequality between rich and poor.  There is the moral abomination of putting real suffering on television as "reality TV" entertainment.  There is coming of age romantic content.  Somehow, Collins doesn't let any of this overshadow either the character content or the narrative action, which always seems to take center stage.  And it's not just the arena action of the blood sport either (although that stuff is awesome - and fills the climax of the book).  Collins has a deft ability to imbue the establishing shots with real tension.  Each scene fits into the plotting tautly - there is hardly a wasted sentence anywhere.  The pace is headlong, relentless, and gripping, while alternating from emotional turmoil to danger to romance and back.  In the aspects of a teenage heroine with tremendous abilities but real vulnerability this book reminded be of "Sabriel" (high praise in my book); but placed in a sci-fi future world that resembles Victorian England far more than Sabriel's magical realist locale.  By the end, Collins makes it clear that this will be a series.  Initially that annoyed me too.  She was so very close to wrapping up all the loose ends in the narrative...  Then I realized that she intends to take on the larger issues of the larger world she has created.  I can't wait.  While the violence and romance are handled lightly, there is still plenty of both.  Given that and the oppressive poverty, starvation, and anger of the setting - the general trauma - I'd be reluctant to give to this to any kid who isn't pretty mature.  I'd say 14 and up.  For them - and adults - this book is highly recommended.
Setting: Panem, formerly known as the United States- now an empty shell of what it was. Set in a future dystopia where the new government is in control of everything and there's a stark difference between the way the rich officials live and the majority of the population of Panem.  Barely anyone can afford to eat. There's beggars everywhere and things such as hunting and scraping by for food are the usual state of affairs for the citizens here.  In this wasteland the rich officials are holding their Hunger Games competition. A competition in which kids (12-18) are forced to compete with eachother and kill eachother for survival. The officials claim this is done to prove a point about some kind of war/struggle in which the new states came to be but soon you realize they do this more for their own enjoyment.  They are the ones with the power and they think they have the right to take people's children and force them into this arena and televise it to their country to watch them kill eachother.  There can only be one winner in this competition. The rest die- the winner gets to live in luxury and peace for the rest of their lives if they come out alive.  In this book you can definitely sense it's the future, yet it's a very dark future. The stark difference between the way the officials live and the rest of the people is unbelievable.  The officials live in a high tech world with everything at their fingertips and the rest of the population lives in a state that is even worse than the depression.  The characters in the book held my interest. I found the struggle of the girl chosen to be compelling, along with the fact she knew one of the competitors she was being forced to kill and she liked him at that.  This book is a mix of sci-fi, adventure and a sad state of affairs that is set in the future. All around, it's a great book that you won't be able to put down until you find out the final outcome of " The Hunger Games."
Gold Star Award Winner!  Twenty-four children: twelve boys, twelve girls, tributes selected by random lottery every year and sent to the capitol city of Panem to compete in a brutal, bloodthirsty fight for survival, with the last participant standing declared champion.  Welcome to the Hunger Games, a grim reminder to those living in the twelve districts comprising what was once the United States of their place as virtual slaves to the gleaming Capitol at their center.  Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen is this year's female representative for District 12, having volunteered to take her younger sister Prim's place. Sent to the arena with the baker's son and classmate, Peeta Mellark -- a boy who, several years prior, saved Kat and her family from the ravages of starvation after her father's death in a coal mining accident -- neither competitor from the final district seem to be contenders.  But Peeta's good nature and Kat's small stature belie the former's cunning intelligence and the latter's experience as a hunter; while a revelation from Peeta during the introductory ceremonies sends Katniss into the first day of competition more than a little off-kilter.  The stage is set, the tributes have arrived, and the cameras are watching...let the games begin.  It is no exaggeration to call THE HUNGER GAMES a pulse-pounding page-turner. Collins grabbed me from the first page and didn't let go. While Katniss isn't always the most likable character (in fact, there were plenty of times I much preferred the affable Peeta, or even sweet, birdlike little Ruth), she is always compelling, thanks to her rational approach to every challenge and her dogged determination.  While THE HUNGER GAMES is a plot-driven novel, the characters and their relationships are the heart of the story.  Ms. Collins has created a dystopian tale of Orwellian caliber for young adults, giving any reader plenty to churn their minds between now and the next installment of this trilogy.  My only complaint is having to wait for the next installment.  Reviewed by:  Cat
I try to read fiction interspersed with all the non-fiction reading to give myself a break from harder reading and so I decided to give `Hunger Games' a go after seeing that the movie was going to come out and asking my mom if the book was worth it.  She said to read the series.  I read the book in two days.  I found the topic interesting in that the future where a small group of elite control everything and live high off the hog while basically enslaving the rest of the people to work and live in squalor is actually, if you read around off the beaten path, a goal of the powers that be psychopaths running the show currently.  If you read what is being funded by the government (think DARPA) you will see the technological horrors presented in the book or something along the same lines are being furiously pursued by the elite.  They want total control and are pursuing a means to that end.  And so it was with that in mind that I think the book has relevance not only for entertainment.  I think it shows what the future holds unless people of conscience stop wanting to just have a quiet life without the responsibility to question and champion the causes of liberty and freedom.  The hunger games parallel the dog eat dog entertainment we are presented with as normal, such as Survivor, and it is high time take the blinders off and see the crap presented by the elite for what it is.  Sad to say the final touches on total National Security State are being put on as I write (NDAA, Executive Orders for full confiscation powers, Patriot Act renewal, etc).  It isn't for the majority of peoples benefit where something akin the life portrayed in this book is a rosy picture as compared to what is actually coming down the pipe.
The New Yorker magazine featured a review of recent teen books featuring futuristic, dystopian states.  Collins' trilogy was the main feature -- it is wildly popular with the 8th - 12th grade set currently.  After all, writes the New Yorker, isn't this what high school is all about?  Getting thrown into a social cesspool, with treacherous peer undercurrents, mortal enemies, painful conflict and autocratic old folks superimposing their will on all individuality?  What fifteen year old can't relate?  The nefarious central government of Panem, having obliterated all dissent in the outlying regions decades ago, must annually remind outposts that rebellion is fruitless, that all power remains with "The Capitol".  Hence, the culling of regional youth to be sacrificed in annual "Hunger Games" wherein teens are thrown into a mano-a-mano winner take all format.  Two dozen sacrificial lambs are led into the arena.  One will emerge.  This brutal premise is the pivot for the trilogy.  Here in the first novel, it grips us.  Pages rip by, as the reader delves in wanting to learn more about how the game is staged, how it unfolds.  This is Lord-of-the-Flies times 12.  We follow the Hunger Games through protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, a moody but athletic tomboy young lady who struggles to keep her family together, to fight government demons, and to decipher her coming-of-age emotions.  This is a terrific read for any young teen, depicting a broken world, but never getting heavy-handed in political statement one way or the other.  My teens never put it down...a quick read.  Would make a fine gift book for a favorite niece, nephew or grandchild.  Totally Dad-approved.  Of the trilogy, this book is best.
This is good science fiction - a future dystopian American society filled with inequality and a Capitol that keeps the various districts of the nation's populace in check through, among other things, a deadly televised game in which young people compete against each other, and the last one standing wins fame, glory and honour. The young people chosen for the games are called the "tribute", and although volunteers are allowed, the nature of the games is such that most people are chosen by lot.  But when the lot falls upon the younger sister of Katniss Everdeen, she volunteers to take her sister's place. And so she is pitched headlong into the hunger games which is a cross between reality TV, gladiatorial combat, Aztec games, Mad Max's thunderdome and who knows what else.  The theme is a powerful but dark one. This is a young adult book rather than a children's book and looking at the basic concept, I was not sure I would like this. There is too much potential for a gory kind of horror story. But in fact this book is not that at all. Instead it is a powerful and moving story, which - like all the best science fiction - reflects upon us now as much as it does the future.  There are a number of connections between this future world and ancient Rome, which given the themes seems to be quite deliberate. But all in all this is an original tale and written with a powerful prose that kept me reading almost without a break until I finished the book.  One scene in particular was very moving indeed. I cam away from the story thinking it was a very human book, and one to set me thinking about what it tells us about our society today.  All in all and excellent work, and I will certainly be buying the sequel soon
Unless you live under a rock, you've heard about "The Hunger Games" and its two sequels. At the time of my writing this review, a little over 5,800 people have also posted on Amazon's site their take on the book. Overwhelmingly, adults and teens rate this baby within the four-and-five star category. It's pretty likely you'll enjoy the story. The movie is also into its second week of release and is justifiably doing gangbusters at the box office. I also just saw the film. It was well acted and keeps pretty close to the book with a few necessary embellishments for clarification and to keep the two-hour film moving along.  Ms. Collins' "The Hunger Games" is written in the first-person narrative. The main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, conveys the right amount of fear, distrust, determination, confusion, anger et al on how a self-sufficent sixteen year old might react to being placed in such a horrible, bloody situation. Because you are witnessing the story through her eyes, you are just as lost and confused as Katniss is about certain events. The author has written a fast-paced, exciting story about survival and how people in power or oppressive governments can not only rationalize doing horrible things to weaker people but be entertained by such doings. This is not too far stretch from our current, need-to-be-entertained, superficial society who love such reality shows as Survivor, Big Brother, or Fear Factor. Look, "The Hunger Games" is a fun read. Its unlikely the book will be given out by a college professor as a reading assignment and that's okay. It's a well-written adventure that certainly left me hanging at the end and wanting to see how the relationships and danger evolves. Enjoy.
I picked this book up because one of my very best friends took my arm and told me I HAD to read it. Together, we have loved Harry Potter, His Dark Materials and the Twilight series. So, when she recommends, I listen.  This one was a page-turner. I tore to the end, neglecting all of my housework and everyone around me. I'm just glad I didn't bring it to work, or I might be writing these reviews full time. On the other hand, I wouldn't mind READING full time if someone would pay me. But I digress. This book! Loved the main character, Katniss. She was tough, she was tender, she was a fully realized character that I could relate to. She was the product of an absentee mother and a less than stable childhood. And so she navigates the world, and the people in it, with distrust. When she is chosen to participate in the Hunger Games, this aspect of her personality serves her well -- as the Hunger Games are kill or be killed. She has help, and plenty of it, but she also relies heavily on herself to stay alive. Watching her struggle, emotionally and physically, is mesmerizing.  This is a dark book. Very dark even by adult standards. Children eaten by wolves, bloody battle scenes, people starving to death and death. Lots and lots of death - hence the whole Hunger Games premise. I would think if you saw this book as an outline, or even reading about it in a review, it sounds far too dark to ever be written. But there is hope there, too, and growth. And stories about courage and love and helping out a friend. I was moved to tears more than once, and I marveled at how accurate and gut-wrenching the book felt to me. This one is a keeper, and will sit on the shelf beside my other beloved YA books.
In the book The Hunger Games, is about a young girl named Katniss or Kat some people called her. She grew up in a world run by a place called The Capitol. In the country it is split up into 12 Districts and Kat lives in the last one, District 12. All she has ever known is life in District 12, till one day she volunteers herself for The Games. There on out, her life is on the line, the question is, will she survive or will she meet death before she comes back home?  I simple LOVED this book. It ends with a cliffhanger and that is why so many others end up reading the sequel, Catching Fire, of the book series.  I simple loved the dynamic Katniss has with the characters throughout the book. Her true colors and humanity shows when she is hanging around the character Rue and Peeta. What surprised me was the love-triangle. Susan Collins woven this story arc so perfectly and leaves you wondering who she will choose in the end.  What kept me reading the book was that some parts I could relate to Katniss in some ways, which I'e always found to be what a good writer has in making their books so popular (i.e. - J.K. Rowling and Stephanie Meyers).  I would recommend this book to both genders of reading. The women will love this book for the powerful image Katniss represents and the love triangles. For the men, it is the action and suspense that keeps you reading it till the end.  What truly struck me was thatStephen King himself loved this book! That right there is compelling enough to make anyone wonder, "why?" and set forth a reading journey.  in conclusion, the book overall was amazing. Susan Collins has written a world of fantasy that is beautifully stunning.  [..]
This tale begins as a simple straightforward post-apocalyptic tale set in the far future when all trace of the USA has been lost within collective memory. Societal organization consists of a technologically advanced (slightly beyond our current capabilities) culture located within the "Capitol" with outlying Districts (1-12) serving as vassal states. Each District supplies the Capitol with raw materials and receives almost nothing in return beyond minimal subsistence. This current arrangement is the result of an earlier (75 years) mutiny that annihilated one District (#13) and resulted in an annual humiliation ritual where each District send 2 children (boy/girl) to battle to the death in the annual Hunger Games for Capitol entertainment and reinforcement of the Capitol's domination.  Our heroine is Katnis, a 16 year old girl who must "volunteer" for the games to save her younger sister's life. Katnis has grown up in a world where life is cheap, meaningless, and without purpose other than staying alive another day. As a character, she is a fascinating mix of childhood innocence with country bumpkin naivete. While skilled in some physical activities, she has had no guidance as to her capabilities and the games become an hour by hour exercise in survival. Along the way, she learns some important lessons on becoming an adult and slowly begins to recognize that the entire system is stacked against her.  At the same time, she recognizes that going from no one caring about your survival to having many people invested in your survival is meaningless when their interests are merely selfish. The basic story is one of survival on your own terms regardless of the consequences.
"Here's some advice. Stay alive."  Such is the tip 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen obtains from her coach, Haymitch Abernathy. But Haymitch is no conventional coach. He has the occupation of training the contestants from his district for... The Hunger Games. Each year, 24 contestants, one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts, are chosen by random lottery to partake in a fight-to-the-death event, which is broadcasted live for entertainment by the Capitol. The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, tells Katniss' story, as she joins with Peeta Mellark as the District 12 competitors to fight it out. Only one will make it out alive.  As someone who generally doesn't read teenage novels, I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with The Hunger Games. A novel about about twenty four teenagers competing in an annual fight-to-the-death event isn't what I would generally place on my reading list. But even I found it difficult at times to read with a critical mind and not become completely engrossed in the story. Marking the comparisons between the Gamemakers and the media today was thought-provoking and new to me. I delighted in getting to know the characters and feel that Collins has plenty to work with in her next novel.  I would recommend that parents of children younger than the age of thirteen read the novel themselves first, and use the knowledge that they have of their children's capacity to handle violence to decide whether The Hunger Games is an appropriate read for them. But for most cases, I highly recommend this novel to those-especially in the young adults' audience- who enjoy science fiction and a well developed story.
Yes, I do find it entertaining.  Yes, I find myself getting swept into the thrill of it.  And then I look at myself and see how easily I become just like the citizens in the story.  After a moment or two of horror at these "games"- children being forced to kill children- after an initial moment or two, I find myself falling into the mass hype of it, the fun of it, the fact that everyone's eagerly anticipating it and wanting to share the experience.  So it's okay, right?  I see children and parents flocking to it together with great smiles and excitement.  ~And yes, the story does have a few moments of real lessons, about real compassion.  But when I witness myself deep-down cheering for Katniss to kill someone, or for anyone to die (as long as they are not Katniss or Katniss's loved ones) l really need to stop. I have to take a look at that, and register the horror of how easily I have just slipped into such feelings, barbaric, hateful, dangerous feelings, that I dedicate my life to opposing.  It is not in line with the person I aspire to be to think even for a moment that I hope someone suffers harm.  The fact that it's only a story, or only a movie, does not matter; this is where we get our heroes, how we practice who we will become.  ...So, just because a story is powerful and thrilling and makes me feel alive, doesn't mean I should honor it and follow wherever it leads me.  Suzanne Collins is a powerful storyteller, and Hunger Games is a thrilling tale.  For myself I can say: This is not a good thing.  ...I'm surprised that when I talk about this with friends, I can't find one single person who has these thoughts. Wow.  What is going on?
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is one of my favorite books for a lot of reasons, one being the excitement of the book. The plot is one of the best plots of any book. It keeps you on the edge of your seat when your reading it. The plot is so good it will make you not want to stop reading the book. It could change from slow and calm to fast and exciting in the matter of pages. At the end of almost every chapter there is a huge cliffhanger that makes you want to keep reading to find out what is happening next. In other words, it keeps you guessing. The plot of The Hunger Games is not only excited but dramatic too. The chose of words that Suzanne Collins uses makes the book just that much better. When I was reading it, all throughout the book I could easily picture what Suzanne Collins was saying, thats how descriptive and well written this book is.    I would recommend this book to everyone. I think it is a great book for anyone, whether you are a romance, excitement, action, or adventure lover, this book is for you. It has everything! That is what makes this book so amazing, the different kind of variety and genres it contains. The Hunger Games is just like any romance book, there is love and broken hearts, people risking their life for each other, and many other reasons. Besides all the romance it is very exciting and action and adventure filled. People fighting to the death for others amusement, some rebelling moves, sacrifice, and many other exciting and action-packed parts.  Although this book may contain violence, I think it is suitable for many ages. Suzanne Collins is very descriptive in this book and it is very easy to follow along.
My English professor &amp; a friend recommended this book to me so I went ahead and read it and I'm so glad I did because this is one of the best book I've ever read (The whole series is amazing). Absolutely LOVE it! I'm not a big reader myself but I already re-read this book at least 5 times.
NO SPOILERS! :D  I could go on about this book for hours honestly. I love the complexity of the characters: Katniss's strength, Peeta's kindness, Cato's brutality, Foxface's cunning, how the characters' personalities were effected by the games, and soo much more!! The characters are very multidimensional and relatable, everything felt so real.  I also loved the description the author utilized. The setting of the arena was extremely detailed, and it felt like I was a tribute in the games! Collins's writing is so authentic.  Most of all, I love the plot. Teenagers fighting to the death for the glory of the districts? Suzanne Collins is one fan-freaking-tastic author! I read that she was inspired to write The Hunger Games by watching war coverage and reality TV. That's amazing creativity!  I would give this book 4.5 stars if I could, just because I love the plot of Catching Fire a teensy bit more. Wait until you meet the tributes in those games! ;)  This book will be remembered for decades to come. I proudly own the ebook and hardcover versions! If you love this series, I suggest the illustrated guides, I only own one of them unfortunately. They're great if you're trying to get a non-reader to delve into Panem! Also on my Hunger Games Wishlist is The Unofficial Hunger Games Cookbook! Check it out ;)  All of the above comes from a 17 year old girl, who falls in love with the series over and over again each time she rereads it. This was probably the fifth or sixth time.  I sincerely hope my review gets you non readers out there to give this book a chance. You won't regret it!
I read this book on my own before reading it with a class of seventh grade students, and I was riveted.  I couldn't put it down.  I literally stayed up all night to finish it.  The kids were equally engaged and kept wanting to read ahead (which is AWESOME!).  The book graphically describes some intensely violent situations so I would recommend this for teens thirteen and up.  I waited until my daughter was 13 before reading it with her and made sure to give her a heads up that it describes some brutal scenarios.  There is very little physical romance but there was some really intense descriptions of teenagers killing each other.  The good news for teachers and parents is that this book will hook both teenage boys and girls - and then you will enjoy it when the kids are finished with it!  The storyline is simple: the story is set in a nation post-rebellion.  The province that is currently in power, the Capitol, is committed to ensuring the obedience of the other provinces moving forward.  So every year, they have each of the other twelve provinces choose a boy and a girl by lottery to compete for their lives in the Arena.  Twenty-four kids enter the Arena, but only one leaves - and they get a life of luxury for the rest of their lives (not as great as it sounds...).  The story follows the main character, a girl named Katniss from a poor province who is a skilled hunter which gives her a distinct advantage in the Arena.  The book explores teenage love, loyalty and courage.  I don't want to give the story away, but I strongly recommend The Hunger Games.  After reading this book, I could not wait to read the other books in the series!
It's not the most amazing literature in the world -- but man, this is addictive.  Read the whole thing in about two days, barely looking up to eat or sleep.  Such an engrossing world, and there are moments that are heartwrenching. Definitely worth picking up.
Pop culture annoys me typically so when I saw how popular the upcoming movie was I was sure that I would be uninterested in the movie and especially the book - until I read about the plot and inspiration for this novel.  And then I kept hearing about it from co-workers who had read the books when originally released and my interest grew.  It's good obviously - there are plenty of reviews here that will tell you that dating back 4 years!  My fear was the romance angle - was this just turning into a political version of the "Twilight" series? I am happy to report that the political and human interest angle of this was not drowned out with a romantic triangle in hopes of keeping any particular type of reader appeased!  You are in Katniss' head the entire time - a young woman who has not just these games thrown upon her, but extra responsibilities she never saw coming.  You get to see how she has to learn to deal with these as well.  Many people told me the book was slow in the beginning, but it never seemed so to me.  I know there are many right-wing American's who view this as a way of seeing how govt can go too far and get too large.  I see that as well when I read this, but not just in the 12 districts and their "tributes".  I see it as well in the people of the "Capital" who are kept distracted and somewhat immune from their leader's cruelties by an abundance of food, entertainment, and other material items.  And remember that it is the poor who are kept down and slaves to the rich in this book - sound familiar?  But I guess it's easy to overlook that oppression when you are given so many toys.
I am an avid reader and I have loved many books, but this is the first one that has captured me so intently that I wanted to write a review.  The Hunger Games was a Christmas present that I haven't been able to put down since.  I finished the book then proceeded to read it from the beginning all over again.  The characters in this book are so rich, well-rounded, and courageous.  The subject matter could be disturbing to some people, but I think part of the beauty of the book is the honesty in which it portrays humans - from our capacity to hurt one another to our capacity for love, compassion, and loyalty.  My birthday is coming up soon and I have asked for the other 2 books as a present, but I honestly don't know if I can wait that long to continue with this engaging and meaningful story.  I am as conflicted now as I was reading the book...  I simultaneously want to devour the story greedily and savor all of the sweet and bitter notes as slowly as possible to make them last.  This is a story I won't soon forget.  I can't do justice to the plot, so I won't try to recap it.  All I can recommend is that you let Suzanne Collins walk you through the story she has artfully weaved because you will enjoy every minute!  I will definitely be recommending this book to everyone I know from my mother to my grandmother to my friends and husband.  This book has the ability to appeal to every type of person I can imagine.  I am usually not a fan of science fiction or fantasy books, but I'm not even sure that this book can be put into one category or another.  It is just a great book all around.  Prepare yourself to be addicted!
The first chapter wasn't an immediate hook, but it wasn't long before I was deeply invested in the characters (my number one demand from a novel). Collins does a fine job of creating well-rounded, consistent characters in this dystopian novel. Did I say consistent? Absolutely. Too many novels fall apart on that point. This one doesn't. Life in the Seam is so well described that the pages actually feel gray and drab. When Prim is selected for the Hunger Games, I could sense Katniss's panic and helplessness.  Collins relies a bit much on flashback in the beginning to create the back stories, but it soon sticks to the present moment and kept me reading each word. Her pace unfolds at a leisurely pace, sometimes feeling a tad slow but always picking back up. I thought the writing would've benefited from occasional section breaks to enhance the passage of time.  The world of the Hunger Games is, to say the least, surreal; at times it comes off as one big game show, like The Running Man. But I never had problems with my suspension of disbelief. The tracker jackers, mockingjays, and the loathsome nature of the Capitol seemed fitting (and in a nightmarish way, plausible). The only time I felt there was a bit of a stretch was the wolf-creatures that were apparently mutations of the other tributes. That seemed unnecessary, and a bit corny. Maybe it plays into book 2, but rabid wolf-creatures would've been enough.  I was satisfied with the end. It wasn't great, wasn't a let down. No big resolution, but at least there wasn't a cliff-hanger (which I despise).  Best book I've read in 2010. Looking forward to book 2.
The book was hard to put down but it was also violent. I'm not sure I'm glad I read it. There are a lot of good books around that are hard to put down without relying on disturbing scenes. It was recommended for my 12 year old son and I think 12 is too young to be reading something like this.
Loved It!!  I'm not exactly sure why I didn't read this sooner. Maybe the idea of kids being placed in an arena to fight for their lives caused me to be a little weary of it, but hands down, this definitely earns a spot on my favorite shelf.  A century after environmental catastrophes have changed the face of North America. The former US, now known as Panem, is divided into 12 districts and a capitol. At one point in time, the districts rebelled against The Capitol but lost. As a result, The Capital now holds The Hunger Games every year. The Hunger Games is a reality show where two children - a boy and a girl - from each district are put into an arena to fight each other and the last one left alive wins.  Not many books have caused me to have such strong emotions, not only for the characters but for the setting as well. Collins created such a believable world and characters that it was easy for me to get lost in their lives and experience the intense situations they were forced to face.  I love Katniss. Her determination to take her sister's place in the games made her a great heroine in my eyes. I couldn't help but root for her every step of the way. She's strong, stubborn, and by far, one of the best female characters in the YA world. Other players had just enough backstory to help me decide whether to love or hate them. There was no unnecessary info, nor was there any details left out.  I completely devoured this book and can't wait to read more of Katniss...and Peta. All I got to say is if you haven't already read this yet, then you're missing out on possible the most exciting book ever!!
Retired professional who was concerned this was really just for teenagers.  Many adult friends enjoyed this book.  Not literary--but compelling and enjoyable.  Have read all three of the books and I kept turning the pages to see what would happen., next.
Approached as an allegory, the characterizations work very well, particularly once you read all three volumes. In this first book, Gale correctly identifies the enemy as the Capitol and nurtures an ideological hatred for it. Peeta hopes that he will not loose himself in the arena; somehow find a way to defy the Capitol's power over his spirit. More than that, he pledges to protect Katniss because of his love for her, something he had done since that day his mother beat him for singeing those loaves of bread long ago. And Katniss? She must find where her self lies between the two poles.  The second volume (no worries, this is not a spoiler) makes mention of *panem et circenses* (bread and circuses), a political strategy described by Juvenal to the Rome of his time that emperors used as a means for to appease the population; the parallels between Katniss's world and Juvenal's are inescapable, but the modern parallel may be closer to home than one might think.  A great book for discussing allegory, foreshadowing, and recurring themes with older children. Hunt for symbols and their meaning. Yes, the mockingjay is hard to miss. The characters themselves represent certain ideals that are wonderful starting places for discussions. Beyond the tools of storytelling, there are questions the author explores about personhood; the proper exercise of citizenship; sacrifice; surrender to our baser instincts and yes, transcendence from it.  At least read the first two books before launching into discussions. If you can, I highly recommend reading all three, and then talking some more!
I'll admit it's taken me a long time to read this book.  I didn't want to get wrapped up in the hype and to be honest the subject matter didn't exactly appeal to me.  I've been reading the reviews for a year deciding if I should take the plunge and read this book.  All I really knew about it was that kids were put into an arena and fought to their death until only one survived.  Not exactly bed-time reading and an enjoyable book to get into.  Now, being an adult I'm sure I have a whole different opinion about this book than your average teen does.  I started reading The Hunger Games and finished the first one in a week.  I even downloaded the second one and read that one in three days!  Now I see why people have read this book.  I'm not going to say it's all fun and games.  There's a lot of violence and if you are kind of queezy and find the subject matter difficult this isn't the book for you.  Yes, it's about kids killing each other but when you get past that part it's a book about control - government control.  I don't want to give the entire thing away and from some of the other reviews there are pretty detailed descriptions of this book.  This is a very good book.  It's a pretty quick read and will keep you thinking about it after you're finished.  One last thing that doesn't have to do with this book.  I've found the reviews of other readers as a great temperature gauge in making my decision to read or not to read The Hunger Games.  When I'm selecting a book to read I very seldom read what critics write but always read what other reader's have written.
I put off reading this for a while, but I was curious about the series because the popularity of this book was amazing, even among adults.  I am glad I finally read it.  This book drew me in from page one.  I could hardly put it down.  Frankly, I wasn't expecting to enjoy this book so much, and I had to immediately buy the other two books.  The premise behind the story is a bit disturbing - a post-apocalyptic world in which children are chosen by lottery to fight to the death on television.  The book has elements of anarchy, oppression, poverty, depression, and hopelessness.  and yet, throughout the story there is love, humor, compassion, cleverness, and intelligence.  The characters are flawed, human, and ring true.  It's also nice, and refreshing, to see a young woman who is strong enough to handle the tough situation she finds herself in.  Katniss carries her family's survival on her shoulders, mainly by hunting in the forbidden zone with her best friend and potential boyfriend.  She recognizes that in the wake of her father's death, her mother is depressed and can't always provide for the family.  Katniss is also protective of her younger sister.  It's not an ideal childhood/adolescence but the author does a great job of bringing forth Katniss' strength as well as her youthfulness and inexperience.  Ms. Collins' imagination is simply amazing.  The complexities of Panam and its various inhabitants are so well written as to draw the reader into the story so completely that it's hard to put the book down.  Brava Ms Collins!  Well done indeed!
I've seen this premise before: the government pitting children (or adults) against each other in a game of death with the ultimate prize being survival. I've always been somewhat turned off from such stories, but after hearing such good things about this book, I had to read it. I'm very glad I did. This is an extremely well written story that hit me emotionally as well.  Katniss lives a dystopian North America which has been divided into districts. Life is tough. Very tough. In order to survive, Katniss has learned survival skills and sneaks out, beyond the boundaries of District 12, to hunt and forage. Each year the children of the districts are entered into a lottery. A boy and a girl will be sent to the rich and hedonistic Capital to compete for their lives in The Hunger Games. When Katniss' sister is chosen, she volunteers to go instead. She is accompanied by her fellow District 12 competitor, Peta. The odds are very much against her.  This book is an emotional whirlwind in a well developed world. From the first page, Katniss is described in a way that elicits the utmost sympathy, though I didn't quite connect with her personally. She's a smart, very "black and white" character who can't always see the subtleties. She can scheme with the best of her competitors, but can't imagine that anyone would have any truly altruistic goals to help her. This can be a little frustrating, but it's the only part of the book I didn't "get." Of course, this book is about killing to survive, so there's a good amount of violence in the book, though it's not gory. I'd recommend it for teens to adults.
The Hunger Games makes me hungry for more! From the first page to the very last sentence this book was glued to my hands! The Hunger Games is a futuristic twist of The Giver and The City of Ember. As soon as I picked up this book, I knew I was addicted. With every page a twist and turn entered the book. As i read this, I wasn't just reading page to page. Every detail and emotion caused to me feel as though I was a member of Panem watching all the behind the scenes of "The Hunger Games." Katniss kept me inside her head making sure I knew exactly how she felt. The Hunger Games is an inspirational story that every type of reader will enjoy! The Hunger Games is full of adventure, battle, mysteries, stories, emotions, and love! The foundation of this book wasn't based on simply struggle. The author Suzanne Collins, continuously brings us back to the battle Katniss is going through, the struggles the "tributes" are facing, and the "love" Peeta and Katniss say to have for each other. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. This book is by far the most intriguing and delightful book I've read. It hit all of my soft points. I found myself laughing, mourning, and in love all at the same time! After I read this book, it was not just a book that sat on my shelf. This book opened my eyes and impacted how I take things for granted and how much the little things are worth.  I would recommend this book to the High School level and higher due to battles and affection. I  think that at some point everybody should read this book. This book has truly given me a new perspective on every day  life.
Well what can I say about The Hunger Games that hasn't been said already. This book has been on my TBR pile for awhile now and thanks to Adam @ Roof Beam Reader I finally put it on my list to get read this year (plus the movie is coming out and I didn't want to see that before I read the book).  Almost everyone knows what the plot is to The Hunger Games. It is set in a dystopian world that for fun (like the Romans and the Colosseum) like to pit children from different Districts against each other in a battle to the death. Now each District has certain advantages depending on what their District is noted for. Katniss and Peeta are from District 12, one of the poorest of the Districts. Katniss originally is not drawn but instead her sister, Prim, is. Katniss knows that Prim would not stand a chance if she goes, so Katniss volunteers to go.  Right away, Katniss and Peeta's sponsors know that they have to be very creative so they play the forlorn lovers angle. Katniss, whose best friend Gale (love triangle alert) is watching back home is forced to go along (or is she?). Katniss and Peeta really compliment each other. Peeta has the strength and Katniss has the brains.  I did enjoy Collin's dystopian world. There is a lot that I know is going to happen in the next two books that I look forward to reading. A caution to all YA readers is that some parts are quite violent but what would you expect when you are fighting to the death. Great read and I think it will be a hit when the movie comes out. Collin's writing is quite visual and I could see some of these scenes play out on the big screen.
Whats my recipe for a delicious read? One part blood sport, two parts love and a zesty pinch of character development, thats what! Sprinkle in some of the most strikingly named characters since my very own General Maddoxton and youve got yourself one savory pot of literary fondue. Katniss Everdeen. Peeta Mellerk. Haymitch Abernathy. Caesar Flickermann. Effie Trinket. The great Emeril Lagasse himself doesnt make Louisiana gumbo this spicy.  Now you dear readers, might be saying to yourself: Eric Jonrosh, warrior-poet and author of the sweeping epic The Spoils of Babylon, set to air on IFC this very January 9thdoesnt The Hunger Games series read much like your off-Broadway musical The Famine Fiasco sounded? Admittedly, it does. But who hasnt written a tale or twelve about doe-eyed adolescents forced to hunt one another in a bloody attempt to satisfy the murderous ambitions of an apocalyptic future society? I personally consider that narrative archetype a fine plot starter for any aspiring dream weaver.  Now if Mrs. Collins were to follow up this fine series with a novel about a rags-to-riches-to-rags-to-riches-to-rags oil tycoon with a borderline incestuous relationship with his conniving adopted sister, Cynthia Morehouse, well then yes, Id be rather miffed. So be forewarned, Suzanne, you may be a salty young scribe, but stay away from The Spoils of Babylon, or youll have heaven, hell and Eric Jonrosh to pay.  Suddenly Angrily,  Eric Jonrosh, author/director/lover of The Spoils of Babylon, airing on IFC, January the 9th, 2014
I liked the book, I did, it was interesting, but the whole time I rad it I felt like hmm where have i seen this plot before. I figured it out. Survivor! this book is just Survivor on steroids. I love Survivor, so I guess thats why i liked the book.
Plotwise there is nothing new in "The Hunger Games".  So, how does Suzanne Collins manage to use recycled plots (a boy/girl story) and still create riviting reading for all age groups and not just young adults?  This is a question that is not so easy to answer.  In the same way that J. K. Rowling used derivative plotlines and characters in her Harry Potter books (wizards, spells, and children in jeapordy are not new and caused her book to be rejected by over 60 publishers) Suzanne Collins uses tried and true plotlines (a self-less act, retaining one's humanity while succeeding in the face of adversity) that have worked in stories for thousands of years.  "The Hunger Games" may not have worked so well if Suzanne Collins hadn't made it a 'coming of age' story about a girl having to change her perceptions.  Katniss Everdeen has survived so far by relying on her wits and skill.  It is not easy for her to accept the possibility of help and unconditional love from a non-family member (Peeta Mellark the baker's son) and survive a televised game that feeds on the grisly deaths of its contestants.  (We have futuristic gladiators on reality television taken to the extreme.)  This is where "The Hunger Games" gets elevated to the level of wry social commentary just as Paddy Chayefsky did with his screenplay "Network".  So, how did Suzanne Collins manage to write such a wonderful book?  The answer is that she carefully crafted her story to appeal to our preconceived expectations for story.  You should read "Wired for Story" for a more in-depth explanation.  So it is.
When I started reading the first few pages of this book I was like, this book is ok nothing really good about it, but as I read more and more of it, I just couldn't put  it down! The Hunger Games has action, adventure, romance, and some violence in it. It was really intriguing! There were lots of times where I didn't know some events were going to happen, then all of a sudden it just surprised me. I also like how Suzanne Collins always leaves you thinking, What's going to happen next? Every time I finished a chapter, thats what I was always wondering, which made me want to read more.  I love the author's writing style, she's always so descriptive in the characters and places, that I didn't have to question what the people or the places looked liked. It felt like I was in the book too, experiencing all the things that happened to the teenagers, I loved it! This book isn't slow or dragging, there is always something happening which kept me entertained the whole time. This is probably the best book that I've ever read and I'm glad that there  are two other books in the series.  The story is mostly about 24 teenagers that have to compete against each other and have to fight to the finish. I think that's kind of scary because you never know when someone's going to come up and kill you. So you have to kill everyone, but also be the last one to survive The Hunger Games.  So overall I would highly recommend this book to young adults or older just because there might be some gruesome things that happen. I cannot wait to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay!
So, I just finished reading The Boys From Manchester, which is written in a first person, present tense narrative (which I really like, because everything is happening while you're reading it, and that always makes it more exciting for me), and it's also a really cool story about teens with superpowers and it has a kick-ass climax. So now I'm all hyped up and looking for something to read that won't let me down after having just experienced such an awesome book, right?  Then a friend of mine, who also read The Boys From Manchester, asks me if I've read The Hunger Games yet and believe it or not, I haven't even seen the movie. It just seemed a little too hyped up, and I'm not really into following the crowd. But my friend says, "You HAVE to read this book." He tells me that it is also written in the first person, present tense narrative and that it will really pull me in. I will admit that I was skeptical going in, but this book is fantastic! Katniss is a great narrator and she takes the time to develop details of the story before the games begin, which I really liked. The action scenes are intense and the quiet moments in between are genuinely moving (my favorite is the scene where Katniss and Peta are in the cave and she's feeding the soup, it was very sweet and tender).  All in all, a great read. It had me hooked from page one. I will definitely be reading Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games) and Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)!
I borrowed this book for free with Amazon Prime and read it on my new Kindle Fire. I loved the books premise of the totalitarian government's The Hunger Games as a repressive tactic against the twelve districts that seem to be on the verge of rebellion. The government is a mix between the central power of the Soviet Union and the brutality of the Nazi party. Not only does the government force the twelve districts to select 12 "tributes" but also uses extreme violence to quell any rebellion. As the main character points out, crimes as small as petty theft are punishable by death. To exacerbate the districts situation, the government also keeps most of the districts in poverty as another tool to prevent rebellion.  Against this dystopic background, is the main character Katniss Everdeen who volunteers for the certain death that being a tribute entails after her little sister is selected. The book follows her journey to the Hunger games and her performance in the competition. The author depicts Katniss and all the other characters brilliantly while even providing sympathy for her opponents. The author focuses the blame for the violence in Katniss's life on the government and tries to depict her opponents as victims of this abuse. The end contains a brilliantly rebellious gesture by Katniss and provides hope for the next two sequels. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an entertaining experience with some food for thought. This book should not be simply classified as Young Adult as i believe this book can be enjoyed by anybody.
I am not an avid reader, nor do I always commit to books I start reading unless they hook me in from the start - convincingly.  I had more fun reading this - and found it harder to put down than The Da Vinci Code.  For adult readers, don't let the "young adult" label this book carries dissuade you from from jumping on the Hunger Games bandwagon.  This book, and the entire series have very mature, adult themes, corruption, unbelievably violent fighting and deaths (of children, no less...) and complex characters.  The only real reason this title deserves the "young adult" label at all is the lack of sex and vulgar language which opens this book up to a wider audience.  I picked up The Hunger Games up free from the Amazon Kindle Owner's Lending Library as my first book for my Kindle Fire, Full Color 7" Multi-touch Display, Wi-Fi. I stayed up until 4am to finish the book. Immediately after finishing I thought about waiting another month for my next "free" book loan to read the next book in the series, Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games).  That thought lasted only a fraction of a second before I purchased and downloaded it... and the last book, Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3) too.  I finished the series within a week - and wanted more!  I can't wait for the movie - and can't wait to see if Collins can come up with a 4th book for the series, which wrapped up tidily in three books... but could always be brought back to life... if we're lucky!
When I first began reading this book I was shocked at the blatant plagiarism of Koushin Takami's "Battle Royale." The book has almost an exact replica of the storyline, and as "Battle Royale" is one of my favorite stories, I was upset. But for some reason I was still unable to put this book down. It was thrilling, suspenseful, and I really found myself liking and cheering on the protagonist, Katniss. Eventually the book begins to distinguish itself as its own story, and this is where I began to really enjoy "Hunger Games."  There were still many shocking similarities to "Battle Royale" and I even felt that it stole the idea of a town with a lottery system for choosing human sacrifices from Shirley Jackson's short story "The Lottery." I just want to make it clear that this book is in no way original, and at times the reader may feel as if they have heard the story before. Despite this I still recommend this book. It does have its strong points. For one it is more of a young adult version of Battle Royale which expands the book's potential audience. Battle Royale has some extremely adult content and themes and although I love the story, I was unable to share it with my 14 year old sister. Although as soon as I finished Hunger Games I lent it to her. It also does have enough distinguishing features to make it its own story, and a good one at that. At the end of book one I found myself wanting more. I definitely plan on buying Part 2, and would tell anyone looking for a fast paced, suspenseful book, to definitely give Hunger Games a read.
The Hunger Games is one of those book series I've seen people mention for a long time. Since I was looking for something new, I decided to pick up the first book, and was not disappointed. The book is set in a beautifully elaborate dystopian world where the districts (which produce various products) are ruled over by the iron first of 'The Capital'. It is all too easy to slip into this harsh world, and feel for the characters struggling in it.  The story starts off a bit slow, which is where the characters really keep you interested. The build up to the Hunger Games themselves (which don't happen until halfway through the novel) doesn't manage to drag too much, and most of the 'stops' that the tributes make along the way end up all having some nice character interaction and development. There is a stark contrast between the two worlds of the districts and the Capital that help to show that the children sent to fight are no more than sheep for the slaughter.  When the games really begin, though, that is when the book shines. Suspicion, tactics, alliances, love, loss... The Hunger Games has so many levels of different emotions that play out in the conflict to stay alive. The only real downside I'll admit is that I would have liked a bit more focus on some of the other tributes from the other districts. Many of them are just faceless entities, so it's hard to get as much feeling over their loss.  Overall, a good read, a fantastic world, and a book that left me intrigued to find out what else would happen once the games have ended.
I have to admit that, prior to reading "The Hunger Games," I had my doubts - not because I didn't think it sounded like a good book or story, but because I wasn't sure if I would be able to handle a book where 24 contestants (that you grow attached to) are forced to fight to the death on live TV. The premise definitely intrigued me, particularly because I think it's a very interesting take on future society (and could in fact be possible), but I just wasn't sure I had the stomach for it. However, although there were no doubt moments that made me cry (which was quite embarrassing considering I was on the plane sitting next to someone while reading it), Suzanne Collins did such a good job with the story and character development that you love it regardless. The deaths are handled very well - they are described in detail yet not overly gratuitous - and there are so many twists and turns that you are literally incapable of putting the book down (or if you do you'll be left thinking about it all day long).    I initially only planned on reading a couple pages on the plane ride from Montreal to Atlanta, and then taking a nap for the remainder of the flight (as I was exhausted and had hardly slept a wink the night before). However, after just 5 pages into the book, I was completely hooked and there was no getting me to shut it. I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. The ending does leave you wanting to know more, but that just makes you anticipate more strongly the sequel. I can't wait for the next book to come out!
The blurb originally piqued my interest for this book and after reading the first chapter through Amazon it was clear to me that it would be very worth while for me to buy it. I live in Australia (where it has not been published yet) and those 2 weeks of waiting for this book really were tough for me.  The plot is simple and brutal and really made me feel for the self-sacraficing and authentically careing main character (which is not often for me with girl protagonists) and in more than a few ways reminded me of John Mardsen's books in the Tomorrow Series. However the part of this book that really kept me intrigued was the sadistic 'Game' aspect that allows the readers to really conect with the characters (especially Katiniss) in the feelings towards the Capitol and in turn the need for her to survive... oh and i guess the interest in the relationship with the Bakers Son: Peeta.  Suzanne Collins was able to hold my interest throughout the book with the relationships formed and broken as well as the mystery behind the 'Game' in which i could never could quite tell what made so uneasy about it (apart from of course the mallicious nature of forcing children to kill each other for a nation's entertainment). The promise of more books to come is intriguing and i am certain i want to be one of the first to find out what happens next.  Like i said before, if you liked John Marsdens, Tomorrow Series mixed in with a little romance and a good handfull of heartache then this is a book you will deffinitely want to check out soon.
Suzanne Collins has written a very powerful futuristic society where 24 young adolescences must fight to the death. Katniss Everdeen takes her younger sister's place as tribute in the annual hunger games. Katniss is the heroine with her bow and arrow. She has taken over her own family since her father's death. Her mother is unable to cope with life. Katniss has become a parent to her sister. She hunts for food in the woods with her best male friend, Gale.  She is not alone in the Hunger Games when Peeta Mellark is with her. She only has one memory of him. Along the long journey, Peeta has had feelings for Katniss.  In this novel, it is rare to see gender roles switch. Katniss, the female, is the stronger and more masculine while Peeta appears weaker and more emotional. Peeta also has a low self confidence and esteem. Still they are a couple to root for the whole time.  I have to say the movie adaptation was faithful to the novel. I enjoy reading about Katniss and Peeta's relationship blossoming over the dreadful hunger games.  To me, this book represents society's obsession with reality shows where lives are ruined for entertainment purposes. Our society has become wrongly transfixed on reality shows as just entertainment. You have to think about how the reality shows affect the willing participants.  If I have one issue with the book, the writing could have been more focused towards the end. I felt the pages could have been edited especially after it was Cato and them.
There are some books that jump off the shelf because their creativity is an easy disguise for a sign of the times. When my wife first suggested the Hunger Games, I thought it was too overtly brutal to become popular. Boy was I wrong. However, the reason it is becoming the next pop-culture book and movie series appears to come from our sense of connection to the plight of the characters. That should lead us to ask: Are we as Americans so desperate in our current recession that we can identify with the Hunger Games? As I read the first book, the link became clear. I could feel the pain of Katniss. She exists in a world where the few have everything and the many suffer in silence. While our current situation as a country is nowhere near the desperate times experienced during the great depression, there are a lot of people suffering in silence.  I watched the movie before reading the book but it did not change my opinion of the underlying drive. You can't help but to feel for the main characters as they face each obstacle before them in what appears to be an impossible environment. How many of us are looking at our small businesses and dwindling paychecks while trying to plan for a future that appears so uncertain. As long as I struggle in my own life, I'll feel the need to follow the adventures of anyone who struggles so mightily in theirs. This is one reason why we love fiction so much. This is why I'm now invested in the Hunger Games. I need to believe that no matter how bad things appear, there is still hope.
SPOILER ALERT  Okay...so I totally loved this book and almost gave it 5 stars, but in the beginning it was hard for me to get into and some of the names are ridiculous (The baker's son is named Peeta - seriously, come on!).  AND it was kind of a cross between the novels Graceling/Fire and the movie Fifth Element...which leads me to a big beef I have with how similar it was to Graceling and Fire.  Don't get me wrong, these are completely different stories but the strong parallels between the books is interesting...hmmm.  For example:  HG: Main character is Katniss / Grace: Main character is Katsa  ---  HG: You see a definite love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale  Grace: Love triangle is between Katsa, Po, and Giddon (Weird)  ---  Both Katniss and Katsa (and Fire for that matter) are completely anti-marriage and anti-children. Hugh...what are we teaching our youth!  ---  Katniss has the incredible survival skills of Katsa and the archery skills of Fire  Katniss is also amazingly beautiful and considered the "girl on fire"  ---  Po loses his eyesight / Peeta loses a leg.  ---  Not to mention the political unrest, corrupt governments, and mass killings.  BUT honestly once I got going, I couldn't stop and I can't wait to read the next installment. All-in-all this futuristic, sci-fi, war game novel with a splash of romance is wonderful. Collins also has a gift of leaving you hanging at the end of each chapter and the book begs for you to keep going.  I can't wait for Catching Fire and Mocking Jay.
I reserve 5 stars for books that (in some way) just blew my mind. (Notice that this one earned 5 stars).  I own the Kindle version and two copies of the paperback (one for marking up).  I am actually 'afraid' of Dystopian fiction: the world seems so 'dystopian' itself sometimes that just reading the news is enough to get a fix, but after a year of resisting, I read it. One and a half days to finish.  Wow.  So much has already been written, I'll try to say something different.  Firstly, this author knows how to write a book: structurally and efficiently. She pulls no punches, there is no waffling on and the layers are subtle and deep.  If inclined, this book can lead to long, late-night discussions on the role of reality-tv, modern China's role in world commerce and the  age-old relationship of rich vs. poor / first world vs. third world and even how America has become more stratified in the early 21st Century. I'm sure I missed some topics.  There are some people who have heard of the book and are horrified that a novel "would condone teenagers killing each other". Yeah. Like Harry Potter "condones the worship of 'the Dark Arts'".  In both cases, these people have not read the books that they are commenting on.  Now, that said, KNOW your teenager. Some could handle this at 14, some only at 19. Choose wisely, but even more importantly, read it yourself first: it may be in the "Young adult" section, but this book is not juvenile in any way.
The most agreeable thing Stephanie Meyer has ever written is on the back cover: "The Hunger Games is amazing." Meyer's endorsement blows my mind, because, let's face it, the Twilight series boils down to an infatuated romance between a lonely, naive teenager and an impossibly good guy centenarian. Now I'm sure Meyer would say Twilight is a romantic fantasy about eternal love and sacrifice. Just like Romeo and Juliet. If Romeo was 35.  The Hunger Games is the exact opposite of that nonsense. The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that Suzanne Collins is a genius who read Twilight, was appalled, and decided to write the exact opposite book. The Hunger Games has strong, self reliant and responsible characters who make...reasoned decisions. These characters are defined primary through their talents and actions, not by their attractiveness. Yeah, they are universally good looking, but it seems like more of a coincidence than a requirement. The romance is realistic. The plot is constantly engaging. The Hunger games is readable, thought provoking, and ultimately provides positive role models for its target audience. It is a great book.  One last thing that makes me even more impressed with Collins. She makes several criticisms of American society for a book with such broad appeal. The "Capitol" is trifling and resource hogging, contrasting the underpaid and overworked residents in the Districts. Suzanne doesn't say exactly what each District produces, but I'm pretty sure one of them makes iPads.
I love this book. It is action packed, and it has great character development. I am on the edge of my seat for the final installment. I try to get every single one of my students who asks for a reading recommendation to read this book.
I think I'm about the last person on the planet earth to read this book, and also about the first person not to absolutely adore these books. I had been told to read them for ages, particularly from Gail. The last 100 pages or so is really what redeemed it for me.  My big issue with this book was the writing. It seriously almost made me put it down, but every time I was about to do that, the book would redeem itself slightly. The first third to half of the book was awfully slow. It was slow reading, but at the same time intriguing. I didn't really understand all of what was going on, so I wanted to know everything.  I loved the characters. Most of them all had such depth and were wonderful. Rue was absolutely my favorite character of the book. I adored her. Peeta was a character I liked right off the bat. Katniss was an interesting character, but I found her a bit annoying. I just didn't like her thoughts. I found her flat and I didn't like her at all.  Another thing about The Hunger Games I really did like was the world. I thought it was simply fascinating and I loved how Collins set it up.  This was overall a good read, but it just didn't live up to what I thought it would be. I have heard nothing but glowing things for it, and while I loved all the character (minus Katniss some of the time) and thouht the plot was original and intriguing, the plot was slower and I really wasn't a fan of the writing. The ending though, was ace, and has me extremely excited for Catching Fire.
Spoilers!    I was captivated from the first chapter and all the way to that cliffhanger ending! I have noticed a lot of comments on the fact that Katniss doesn't have the voice of a 16 year old girl, but I think that you would sound older too, if you have gone through what she had. Single handedly feeding her mother and sister, braving the hardships of the woods, and winding up in the Hunger Games.   I loved how everything was described, there wasn't too much scenery description, but I thought that that fit Katniss, who strikes me as the type of person who pays more attention to what's hiding, rather than what's actually there.   I love how attached Katniss is to Prim, her little sister, I really have to think that that is who Katniss loves the most.It's proven when Katniss decides she will have to try and win the Games, even though it would be nearly impossible for her, because her sister begged her to. Also, Katniss gets attached to Rue (my favorite character), because of her similarity to Prim. And when Rue dies, it's almost like her own sister has died.   I also enjoyed how Katniss battled her way through the Games, facing a new adventure and challenge around every corner. I also found myself really immersed in Katniss's feelings, when she's scared, I find myself feeling the same way, and I cried when Rue died, and I loved the song Katniss sung to Rue.   Overall, I think that this book is for ages 11 and up, and that it is the type of book to read over and over again!
This wonderful book (and its sequels) have done three prominent things: One, made me cry. Two, Made me laugh. three, made it onto my top ten series list. The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and -of course- Mockingjay, are absolutely a trilogy that I would reccommend. There are a few things that you should know before buying/ reading this book, though. First, these books are dark. Very dark. There is lots (and lots and lots) of killing, murdering, poisoning, torturing, mutilating, etc.(I'm not even going to go into what happens in Mockingjay)! Second, these books also have romance. Mind you, there is nothing more than in the frist three books of twilight, so if you've read those, you're safe. Okay, so to wrap up my review, i'll tell you some books I would reccommend if you like this book, or it sound a little too scary for your likes. First and Foremost, HARRY POTTER. If you haven't read it, READ IT READ IT READ IT! Second, Suzanne Collins' other books, The Overlander series, is a great read. i think there are around... 6? I don't know. If The Hunger Games sounds too dark, Gregor the Overlander is good. A third and final series I reccommend is the Fablehaven series. these books are kind o like the Harry Potter books in the way it tells about another world that Coincides with our world.  Well... I had no idea I had written this much! if you took the time to read this insignificant 7th grade Luna Lovegood fan's review of The Hunger Games, Thank you kind person! :D Ciao!
Despite the fact that the basic premise is nonsensical, and some major logical inconsistencies notwithstanding, this book is kind of a fun read. It takes a while to get going (all the exposition was pretty superfluous, since I didn't end up caring much about the characters anyway) but the telling of the preparations and the actual games is exciting and in some ways even original. I kind of hoped the ending would involve more death, but maybe that's just me being morbid.  My suspension of disbelief broke down repeatedly through this story--I'll give a couple of examples. First, though less important, the premise of an empire that makes its tribute nations pay for expensive welfare services by sending ritual sacrifices to a gladiator fight seems improbable, from both a social and economic standpoint. Then there's the protagonist's outstanding archery skills (somewhat unbelievable in itself, but we'll let that go) which, when actually needed, tend to fail her spectacularly. I guess the book would have been too short otherwise. But the big one is her total lack of empathy or emotional intelligence. In fact, her obtuseness is drawn out so long, even with other characters trying to fill her in, that it goes beyond contrived. Ignore that, though, and the disparity between the high level of technology apparently available and the extremely low level in use (no, poverty does not explain it) and you can just sit back and enjoy the action sequences and some of the imagery.
When I first opened this book, I did not expect it to live up to the hype.  However, this book grabbed me from the get-go and held on for dear life.  It was certainly one of those "I can't put it down!" books.  The pacing was excellent, sweeping you from one plot point to the next with no time in between to get bored with filler or exposition.  The games themselves were portrayed exquisitely.  It is such a brutal, inhumane concept and yet the writer managed to create beautiful touching moments inside the games and expertly tackled the questions I had as to WHY the children would willingly participate in these games and not just band together to deprive the Capitol of their entertainment.  I think the only complaint I had about this book was that Gale's character, who was obviously an essential part of Katniss' history and played a major role in her becoming the person she is who makes the decisions she does, is not fully fleshed out.  He's kind of flat in the background.  Hopefully by the end of the series, he will get some much needed character development time so I can truly appreciate him as a character.  As it stands, as much as I feel I SHOULD be rooting for Gale in the question of who will win Katniss' affections, it's very hard to not root for Peeta as he's the only one we really get to know.  While I feel this book might be a bit too brutal and violent for young adults, I don't think I would change the format this was written in even if I could.
I must say, reading this book will change yout life, (and make you want to watch the movie) it's so heart filling. I have sooo much praise for this book, I have to give multiple reasons. (Don't mind me, I just love making lists.)  1. The characters. I loved the way I felt like I was Katniss,yet felt like I was watching as a guest of the Hunger Games just with all of her thoughts. I love how she isn't 'charming' or just a country gal with no talent at all.  2. The story. It was classic and original, and while I read this book I wasn't thinking "wow, that's exactly what happenes in  3. The way she described things. It was just "a forest" it was the arena forest. How Katniss uses her surroundings, cracking to even the smallest of details like how she belted herself ino the tree.  4.The flow. Everything that happened wasn't like some random suprise. It built off everything perfectly. It takes hard work to get into a flow. I'm not surr howmny hours she spent slving over this book, but it was obviously enough.  I love this book, and read it like no tomorrow. READ IT. Once I got going with this book, I couldn't put it down. No, couldn't isn't the word, I wouldn't put it down.  If you look at the title, you see another book mentioned. That's because since The Hunger Games is so good, it deserves a comparison. To me, I can't decide which is better.  ~ Awesomeness :)
Typically, I don't write reviews.  Ironically, I always use Amazon's reviews before making even the smallest purchase.  Therefore, I am extremely grateful that so many people took the time to review this outstanding book.  Now, I feel the need to add to the praise for Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  I am a mother, lawyer, avid reader, and aspiring writer.  Each of these titles allows me to view books in different ways.  I must say that Hunger Games (and later Catching Fire) satisfied every bit of my personality.  I literally couldn't put either book down.  I took both Hunger Games and Catchig Fire with me everywhere. . . in the car, the bathroom, the dinner table.  I literally stayed up for 24 hours at a time wanting to know what happened to Katniss.  This book is not for the faint-hearted.  It reminds me of 1984, Brave New World, and, dare I say, Clockwork Orange, as society has crumbled and a new regime installs itself into a country that was once free.  Hunger Games is the first book that I have recommended to family and friends and begged them to read.  Some scoffed because of the "Young Adult" genre affixed to the title.  After reading the book, each one has called and thanked me (all became as addicted to the story and I did).  This has become my go-to gift for everyone over the age of 14.  Pick these books up and don't put them down.  Then you, too, can anxiously wait for Mockingjay in August '10 with the rest of us!
My daughter had me read this book because she enjoyed it so much. It is very well written and I had a hard time putting it down. I read all three in the trilogy over the course of 8-10 days. The story is not quite as complex as an adult novel, but it makes up for with tension and action. I would definitely recommend this for adults as well.  The concept of the Hunger Games is intriguing. As I was reading, I kept thinking about the Romans and the parallels with the gladiatorial games. The Hunger Games pit adolescents against each other in a fight to the death with only one left standing. The arena was very interesting and is not "static". I don't what to spoil the fun, so I'll just say that similiar to the Colosseum, the arena for the Hunger Games is full of surprises. I've seen the trailer for the movie and I don't really want to see it. After reading all three novels in the series, I had all the places and characters firmly established in my mind. I tribute that to excellent writing. If you're like me, you'll be pulled into the story quickly and this will turn into a page-tuner of the highest order.  The only few minor complaints I have are with fact that the mother has such a trivial role. I would assume this character would play a larger role given the main character is a minor. But, I attribute this to the novel being geared towards a younger audience. But, this doesn't take away the enjoyment of the story.
THE HUNGER GAMES  With me being almost the 24,000 person to write a review, going into details is not essential.  What I will say is that I loved HUNGER GAMES, CATCHING FIRE, and MOCKINGJAY.  I purchased all three books at once and am so glad that I did.  I could read them one after the other and enjoy every second of reading.  I read all three books in less than a week's time.  The series is dark, disturbing, frightening, isn't sugar-coated and full of frills and daisies.  It is hard hitting and hard core, death awaits every character and strikes often.  Details are gory, bloody, and not for the faint of heart.  The action is constant.  Ms. Collins is certainly blessed with an awesome and mind boggling imagination.  I could not turn the pages quickly enough.  I have not seen this on the big screen but I did check out the actors who played which characters and this enhanced my enjoyment of the book.  Setting faces with the people in the book added pleasure to an already wonderful reading experience.  If you are like me and are one of the few people who hasn't yet enjoyed this series, you are in for a treat.  It is fun, exciting, daring, and at times made me laugh out loud and even brought me to tears quite often.  The characters are fully fleshed out and real, the plots fast paced and full of cliff hangers and surprises.  Highly recommended for just about everyone!  Enjoy!
Although recommended to me more than a year ago I put off reading this series because it was in the teen genre, and I typically can't stand those books.  I borrowed the kindle edition from the kindle owners lending library and was pleasantly surprised.  I seriously could not put this book down and finished it in a matter of days.  The story line of this book was unique to anything I've read before and I found it very engaging.  At first I hated that it is written in the first person because it made it obvious that the main character wasn't going to die, but I think the book would have been far less interesting written any other way.  Part of the reason it is so interesting is that you really only know what the main character is doing or thinking, so it makes everything a lot more suspenseful and the main character much more engaging.  Although the book ends with a bit of a "to be continued" there is enough of an ending to be satisfied.  I could not wait to get on to the next one so I'm glad this is a series and not just a single book.  As an adult I would be more than happy to let my teen read this series.  I feel like it is very appropriate for a young reader despite what some describe "brutal" or "graphic".  As compared to many many other books I've read... this one is very tame!  I highly recommend this one if you haven't read it... I can't believe I didn't pick up this series sooner and can't wait for the movie!
I had not read "The Hunger Games" up to now because I figured it was typical young adult literature. It is indeed that, but it is better than most of the young adult work out there. I would be lying if I said I was not caught up in the text and that there were times when I could have just sat and read and read.  I realize that the text has some flaws and that it is not all that deep a story, although to a teenager it would seem to be, but it is not targeted to the mature reader so why would I expect it to be mature in its themes and presentation? As a text it is well written, and very excellently plotted. There are also some very thoughtful lines in the book that will give something extra to the more mature young adult reader, and will be missed by the immature reader with no harm done.  A quibble with the novel would be that the romantic subplot at times veers too much into stereotypical teenage love, and when Ms. Collins focuses on that aspect of the plot the writing is noticeably weaker. To her credit though, the romantic angle is incorporated into the story in a clever and unconventional manner.  "The Hunger Games" is a great example of a gripping thriller that is written in a well executed style that will blow away most young readers, and impress and entertain older ones. I greatly enjoyed the text, and will read the following two novels in the trilogy. That sounds like a successful book to me.
Okay, so, this is officially considered a Young Adult book, but don't let that hinder you in any way from reading it. The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting made up of the Capital and its twelve territories. As punishment for a war in which the territories came out as losers, each territory must provide two "tributes," (one male and one female child each) to compete in a Gladiator-style game; a fight to the death for all but one of the tributes. The games are watched avidly by all; for the Capital (which is not required to provide tributes) they're a fun diversion, but in the territories families live in fear of losing their children to the annual event. Sound twisted? It is.  When her younger sister, who she adores, is selected to be the female tribute for District 12, Katniss immediately steps in to take her place in the games. Katniss and Peeta, her male counterpart, are immediately caught up in the whirlwind festivities of the games; cameras, make-up, interviews, and costume changes galore. Reality sets in, however, as soon as the 24 tributes are dropped into the playing field; an enclosed world created specifically for the games and filled with unknown threats.  I don't want to give any spoilers here, so I'll stop with my description, but suffice to say this book will keep you on the edge of your seat. And you don't have to be sad when it's over - there's two more after!
I adored this book. I had no knowledge of it whatsoever when I started reading it. All I knew was that it was gaining a lot of fans and a movie would be coming out soon. So I seen it was on sale so I grabbed it for my kindle. I couldn't put it down! what a great idea and imaginative plot.
I'm awe inspired by Suzanne Collins talent.  She had me before the first page was read.  The anticipation leading up to the `games' was intoxicating making me abandon duties, family, and life.  There was no let down; the payoff was brilliant and the anticipation worth it.  I found myself, angry, frustrated, teary, excited, scared, hopeful, multiple times each.  Granted the concept isn't new but the author's version stands impressively high.  It's a rare book when you can get this attached to the characters.  Characters you love, root for and don't want to throw the book because of how stupid and whiny they are.  Finally a strong female that kicks butt all by herself.  Spunk is an understatement.  She knows when to hide emotion, and when to cry for real reasons.  She has compassion, empathy, charity, but also knows when it's time to kill, and continues to hold onto her humanity in horrific circumstances.  I think I have a new hero.  You know a book has made an impression when you drive people crazy with talk about it.  Even further when you finally put it down to get some sleep and your dreams are filled with post apocalyptic games of survival until the morning comes when you can read again.  I can't remember the last book that had me this obsessed, trying to find any waking moment to read, and angry when I'm interrupted. Bravo Suzanne Collins, Bravo.  J.B. Fisher author of Sunset and Enigma
I found the novel The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, to be an amusing and captivating novel. It takes place in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic world where the capitol of Panem, 12 poor districts surrounded by a harsh, wealthy capitol, is conducting something called the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a televised fight to the death that acts as punishment for a past rebellion led by the 12 districts. Every year the capitol requires two names to be drawn from a raffle from each of the 12 districts, one boy and one girl from the ages of 12-18. The people with their names drawn will be sent to an arena will they will all try to kill each other on live television. When Katniss Everdeen's little sister, Prim, gets chosen Katniss must volunteer for her as the only way to save her life.  This book is extremely fast-paced, so it is extremely good for anyone who gets bored easily with slow books. I highly recommend it to people of all ages. The Hunger Games brings a new twist around every corner that keeps it captivating and hard to put down. One of the main reasons that I like this book is because the plot has constant threats that could appear at any moment and spice up the story even more. Many people might think this is just some violent, gory book, which it is, but there is also a love story that takes place throughout the book. I would recommend this book to boys and girls of all ages.
THE HUNGER GAMES is a great piece of entertainment.  While this novel is designed for the Young Adult market, its plot is better constructed and more imaginative than most books I've read for adults.  The dystopian storyline deals with a young woman forced to participate in a reality show where the contestants are forced to fight to the death.  While this idea is far from original, author Suzanne Collins is able to breathe a great deal of life and vitality into her characters and situations.  The result is a novel filled with excitement and surprises.  Once THE HUNGER GAMES gets going, there is hardly a dull moment.  This book does suffer from some shallow characterization (particularly in its villains), but the compelling, lightning-fast plot more than makes up for it.  For a YA novel, THE HUNGER GAMES is a surprisingly violent read, and includes violence directed against young children.  While none of it is gratuitous, some of it is quite heartwrenching.  I therefore wouldn't recommend this book to a sensitive child or one under the age of thirteen.  THE HUNGER GAMES is a YA novel an adult can fully enjoy.  I liked it far more than TWILIGHT, and almost as much as the early entries in the HARRY POTTER series.  I can see why this book is seen by many as the "next big thing" in YA literature.  This is the first of a series, and I look forward to reading the next entry.
Let me start by saying honestly, is there anyone who didn't like this book? I mean c'mon, this thing has blown up like crazy! And I'm going to admit, I wanted nothing to do with it... at first. But then I gave it a chance thanks to Battle Royale which it resembles too much to be a coincidence and I happily report that I'm glad I did. Suzanne Collins rocks! This is one powerful story. There is SO much emotion in this book it's crazy.  It's impossible not to love every character. Of course when it comes to the teams I'm going to think outside the box and say Team Effie all the way! Sure I love Peeta and Gayle, but they're still boring. One is a hopeless romantic with his heart on his sleeve, the other has his heart up his you know what. They're great and all but Effie is where my loyalty lies. I would welcome all of the Capitol craziness with open arms. I know, I'm terrible.  It takes a LOT for me to get emotional when I'm reading or watching a movie. Seriously, a lot. And while I didn't cry reading or listening to the audio, the movie is definitely going to pull on my heart strings. Just watching the trailer gives me goosebumps, now that's impressive! But really people, stop comparing this series to Twilight and Harry Potter. This is NOT vampires and wizards, it's something that could actually happen in the future which makes it even more intense.
The huger games is truly  amazing book. A true work of art as many would call it. It captivated me and kept me reading on and on until I had read it three times. This book is so amazing. Iknow people think its bad because of what the hunger games are but they are not what they seem. I mean I loved this amazing,amazing,amazing book. It is packed with action and keeps you on your feet at all times. I kept reading this book through and through. This book kept me up all night. Literally all night until i finished reading the book. One thing though, after the book I literally thought about the book and had the characters stuck in my head. The book is that good that it keeps you thinking about it over and over again. The first movie though was raved about didn't capture what Ihad originally imagined. Though it was good it didn't match some of the main features of the book. For instance the cornucopia was supposed to be gold and not a grey modern sculpture, and I personally didn't have the hell-hounds featured as the way they looked in the movie. Personally I thought they were going to look like the Egyptian dogs. I know I am being to picky but the imagination is a amazing place where books come to life and well I guess you just expect to see what you had imagined but I mean you can't have a 10 hour long movie can you. Anyway its a great book and I hope everyone reads it.
The Hunger Games has so many levels it's hard to know where to begin.  The first level of course, is the exciting life and death story of Katniss, a girl a future where reality t.v. is not about 'getting the millionaire to pick you' but about staying alive.  It's easy to see that if our government clamped down on us enough to cause an uprising, that it would use a form of entertainment to keep us in line.  Suzanne Collins has written a brilliant book will last through generations in the same why that Fahrenheit 451 has done for the previous generation.  The Hunger Games show just how important ideas can come to life in a powerful way.  If I were a teacher, my class would be reading this book no matter what grade I taught.  That Collins could put her ideas into such an exciting plot shows how good she really is.  The characters are not cardboard cutouts.  They have strengths and weaknesses, along with the trials of just being a teenager. With the United States divided into 13 sections, there are varying degrees of hardship for the characters, yet they find a reason to live through their love of family and each other.  I'm already starting book 2 of the series where the story of Katniss and the two boys she loves continues.  I highly recommend this exciting book and can practically guarantee your young reader will love it.  Great for either a boy or girl.
The Hunger Games is a tragic, yet compelling, story where reality television has morphed into something much more sinister. The Games are part Survivor- if you replace the castaways with children called tributes who battle each other in a gladiatorial fight to the death. It is also part of the makeover shows where those same tributes are fed the best foods and dressed by the best designers. The Games are a political tool in the post apocalyptic world, designed to keep the population of the remaining districts in check. The main protagonist is Katniss, one of the tributes from District 12. She is faced with many challenges, with the odds stacked against her from the beginning. When her sister is randomly selected as the tribute, Kantiss steps in. Within the Game itself, the government controls situations to make for better entertainment. It is heartbreaking watching her try to survive the Games without losing her identity.  While this would be enough for a gripping story, Collins throws in the personal struggle of sorting though her feelings, specifically in regards to Peeta, the other tribute from district 12.  Kantiss is a pawn, but what a pawn she makes. At times she is ruthless, at others truly compassionate. She is a well-created character, and more than capable of carrying the story. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books!
First, I must say that I have a rebuttal for those who rated this a single star because it's a 'rip-off' of other material.  Okay. Seriously? In this day and age, it's virtually impossible to have a single original thought. You know what? The idea of tributes and such goes even further back. Try Crete. Ancient Greece. What makes a story original is how it applies different concepts based on each author's unique experience. A blending of different ideas that one has encountered. Now instead of fussing with this pretend ennui of 'been there, done that' we should be criticizing the true pros and cons.  Now onto more pertinent matters.  I thought that the Hunger Games was stunning. Collins did a great job adding twists and turns at every corner, and if someone claims to have 'seen it all before' they are most likely imagining things. The situation that the main character, Katniss, is placed in is unimaginable, even unbelievable, for many of us. But her quick thinking and skills are admirable. And so the twists of morality that some people find objectionable ask the bigger question. At what point does one say 'enough is enough?' And at what point can one justify manipulation and deceit? What is the true value of life?  The book is not pretty. But it's gripping, fascinating, and thought-provoking. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.
Compared to other dystopias, such as 1984, Animal Farm, Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, or Fahrenheit 451, The Hunger Games is mediocre at best. I saw the film first and was underwhelmed, so I read the book to see if that was an appropriate response on my part. The novel is only marginally better, providing more details and a deeper character study of the heroine, Katniss Everdeen. The other characters in the novel were sketchy, in my opinion, but I awarded two stars for the depiction of the tenacious Everdeen. As for her two love interests, there is insufficient chemistry to create interest on the part of the reader. The most interesting part of the novel for me was the preparation for the games. The games themselves were anticlimactic, lacking in suspense, and even ho-hum at times. The most egregious flaw in the novel is the depiction of the futuristic society--or should I say lack of depiction. It doesn't come alive for me and I can find little satirical intent other than a skewering of reality tv shows. There is evidence that the society has advanced technology, but as to the people who live in it or run it, they are amorphous to the point of almost lacking identity. In the final analysis, the novel seems to be nothing more than an excuse to set a group of teenagers at one another's throats, periodically throwing obstacles in their path.
I FINALLY had the opportunity to read The Hunger Games, the first book in the series that everyone seems to be talking about. It is a favorite for many, and that now includes myself. North America is in ruins, but from those ruins arises Panem, a new nation, a capitol that is surrounded by 12 districts. At one time their were 13 districts but there was an uprising. After the Capitol quelled the rebellion and destroyed the 13th district they created the Hunger Games as a reminder to the people of just who was in control. There are 2 competitors from each district, one boy and one girl, who are chosen from a lottery. All the competitors are taken to a location where they are released and expected to kill each other off because there can only be one winner. All the while they are being filmed so that everyone can watch the bloodsport on their televisions. The winner will get a life of ease after the games and their district will be showered with gifts.  The story follows Katniss and her progression through the games. I instantly liked her character. She is intelligent and has a great survival instinct that gives the reader hope for her to win. I am going to have to immediately delve into Catching Fire, the second book in the series, to read what happens after the games. I sense a possible love triangle and am anxious to see how that pans out.
I never read teen books, but the more I kept hearing about The Hunger Games, I ordered a sample to read on my Kindle.  I didn't even have to finish the sample before I realized this was so much more then just a teen book, so I bought it. Though I don't normally like to read first-person, because it takes a very skilled writer to write in that format, I found that Suzanne Collins is, indeed, a very skilled writer. The book was much more then teen...it has great appeal to adults as well because it is written very maturely and also the emotions and observations of this young girl was a mature accounting. The plot was unique, suspenseful, poignant at times, horrifying at other times, and sends you into this society that is frightening. One of the things that particularly caught me and showed me the skill which this writer has, was Katniss' description of Prim's cat. She talked about the cat being ugly, with a face mashed in, half an ear left, and eyes the color of rotten squash. I loved that description! I knew right then I would love the way Suzanne Collins writes. I went ahead and purchased the other two books in this triology as well and loved them also. Plus, my husband who never reads this type of book, was convinced to read the trilogy and so I loaned him my trilogy. He was so impressed and admitted that this was writing at its best!
I ignored the hype that was the Hunger games for quite a while and even turned down an invitation from a friend to go and see the movie but like most things, I eventually got sucked into it one night when my husband and I were looking for a movie to watch.  It was a good movie.  I was worried that it would be a poor version of the classic movie Battle Royale or the love triangle of Twilight but it stood on it's own two feet.  I was then inspired to read the book on the back of the movie as I wanted just a bit more background and details on the characters and overall story.  The book gave me this.  It was well written and flowed very well.  Part I allowed us to meet "The Tributes" giving us a good background of the main characters and the reasoning behind the Hunger games.  This part was not covered in as much detail in the movie so it was interesting for me to get a better feel for Katniss and Peeta, the two main characters.  Part II was the actual games and made up the majority of the movie.  It was suitably graphic without being too much so - I guess it is aimed at Young Adults so was less graphic than it could have been.  I was disappointed at some of the detail that had been left out the movie but glad I read the book to pick it up.  Part III the story of the Victors and, I guess, the lead up to the second book in the trilogy.  A bit predictable but I am hoping that it is just setting a certain scene that will be developed latter on.  I am not sure what the justification behind writing this as three books rather than one large book - was it to split it up or just to make more money.  You can't say that the book would have been too long otherwise or you just have to look at each of the Game of Throne books to know that they work at over 1000 pages each.  I would have preferred to just have one book to keep on reading as I now have to re-motivate myself to read the next two.  Although on the plus side, I can put it down and read something else and then go back to it, something I would not do if it were one whole book.  Slightly torn on that one.  An interesting read and I am really looking forward to finding out more about how Panem came about, I just hope the author covers that.  My fear is that she doesn't and it ends up just another predictable love triangle story similar to Twilight. 4 out of 5.
disclaimer--this is more my complaints than an actual review, so this will sound really negative, more so than how i actually felt after reading the book. also possible spoilers.  i wouldnt have to write this if not for the scene where the hero is supposed to die, but saved by the pompous arrogance of the killer. in a situation where 24 children are pitted in against each other in a battle to the death im supposed to believe that a little girl is gonna completely lose her focus and give the ole "im gonna enjoy this" speech. wtf!! kill her already! this is the most dangerous part of the arena. more than any other time in the book you should be looking over your shoulder and youre gonna get cocky? bad. bad, bad scene.  this isnt a reality tv book. its a barbarian sport book. and the barbarians are not givin any mental capacity at all or human characteristics.. people can do amazing things in a pinch, yet adrenaline never even enters the story... its just a book, so i guess its fine that only katness matters and everyone and everything else is just a prop... 11 people die in a brutal battle for tools, and apparently only those 11 received so much as a scratch during the battle.. like the victors received full health jugs after the fight. just props.  this event is bigger than anything that happens to these people. they have a hero in district 12 that has won before, yet theyve never seen the footage? they dont know how he won? like a 15 year old baseball freak in boston not knowing what david ortiz has done, and not understanding basic baseball strategy. i hate when people that dont know anything about sports try to write about a sport.  no one begins to crack up, lose their sanity in these awful conditions. it would be perfect if peetas purpose in the story was to keep katness' sanity, but its just not. the possibility of being drained from the constant unimaginable stress, like the adrenaline, is never introduced.  the puppy love scenes... dont get me started.  okay, a tad harsh. the book gets 3 stars. just i cant understand how you can write a book about sports and war, and be so negligent to the psychology of both. or a survival book without covering any basic human survival tendencies.
I have heard nothing but praise for Suzanne Collins Hunger Games series and have been longing to read the books.  Now, thankfully, they are finally available in Braille.  The only word that comes to mind after reading the first installment in this series is "wow".  The sheer brilliance of Ms. Collins descriptive ability and her engaging characters will leave you breathless.  I am devouring these books at a break-neck pace.  The stories are choice feasts; utterly tasty even though the fare is extremely heavy.  Be forewarned that these books are not lighthearted material.  However, they achieve what any exceptional books do.  These stories succeed in making you think.  In a futuristic society called Panem, a Capitol city is surrounded by twelve districts that are each responsible for providing sustaining materials for the Capitol's survival.  Seventeen-year-old Katniss Everdeen lives in the coal-mining District 12, where she has taken on the responsibility of caring for her fragile mother and twelve-year-old sister, Prim after a mining accident took her father's life.  As a result of an uprising several years earlier, the sadistic rulers in the Capitol have devised an annual televised event: the Hunger Games.  The Games not only serve as an effective tool to discourage rebellion, but they also serve to exhibit the Capitol's stranglehold over the districts.  A male and female child from each district is chosen to enter an arena and fight to the death.  The final child left standing is crowned the Victor.  During the annual Reaping to choose the children, Katniss' sister's name is drawn.  The older girl immediately volunteers to take her sister's place.  What follows is a riveting story in which a brutal struggle for survival is played out for a decadent society's entertainment.  Will Katniss survive the Games? Will her fellow district partner, Peeta Mellark, become her ally? If Katniss survives, what will her life entail?  I was repeatedly struck by the relevance of this novel.  I could easily see a version of the Hunger Games being played out on our own televisions in the not-so-distant future.  Although I despise reality TV shows, many of my friends love them, and the connection between our society's constant craving for entertainment mirrors that of the fallen Roman Empire.  Surely, it is no accident that Ms. Collins uses such names as Caesar Flickerman, Seneca Crane, Coriolanus Snow, and Claudius Templesmith for some of the characters from the Capitol.  None of the characters are flat or uninteresting, and my favorite character is Peeta, the kind yet resourceful baker's son whose talent for decorating the cakes that his family sells proves to be a useful talent in the arena.  Although Katniss disdains the merchant families in her district, (of which Peeta's family belongs), she cannot forget a single act by the baker's son that ultimately determines her own actions at a crucial point in the story.  I love that Katniss is portrayed as unsentimental and determined, yet, ultimately, a person like the rest of us.  We, too, are desperate to survive, and we long to be heard.  Peeta asserts that he does not "want to be just a piece in their games".  May this same sentiment be our wish as well!  Please give this unforgettable novel a chance.  God bless you all.
At this point, there's not much else to say about Suzanne Collins' international best-seller THE HUNGER GAMES. The book is a hit, and a movie is coming out in spring 2012. It is loved by young adults (its target) and adults everywhere, and has won numerous awards. I can easily say that the book deserves all its accolades, it lives up to its hype, and I'm glad I read it.  For me, the plot is just like the movie and Stephen King short story THE RUNNING MAN, where, in a bleak future, contestants are thrown into an arena and must fight to the death. The last person alive wins and receives numerous awards. Collins makes her version of the story work by creating a future in which America ceases to exist. The country of Panem has taken its place and has 12 districts. Every year, each district must send two children to compete in the Hunger Games where they will fight to the death. This is required to punish each district for a revolt against the capital years ago.  The power of the novel comes in the characters and their every day lives. Katniss is 16 and lives in District 12. She and friend Gale spend their days hunting and selling their goods on the black market. Katniss is chosen for the Games and must leave Gale and her younger sister Prim behind. The lurid spectacle before the games is fascinating, as each player is worshiped like a celebrity. Once the games begin, there is heartbreak and violence as Katniss struggles to stay alive while trying not to get too close to others playing the game, including Peeta, a boy from District 12.  I am so glad I read this novel, and already have the second book in the series and will soon start it. Collins writes in away that captures your imagination and she doesn't let go until the final word is written.
When I picked up the Hunger Games, I only guffawed. My friends told me it was a good book and that it should be read by anyone who wants to read a good book. But I took them for granted. I didn't think a book with a cover like such and a name like that would be good. But I literally fell captive to the phrase, "Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover." I had to read this for a project in English class. On my reading log, I had one entry. I had finished the book in one day! When you pick up this book, you might not feel elated, or you might not feel excited. But once you open that book up, the emotions of Katniss and everyone around her just flow off the pages. The action is clear in your head and the suspense KILLS you. This book pushes the boundaries of a good book and a great book. My friends were more than wrong when they told me it was a good book. It's a great book and should be read by... everyone. My mom even picked up this book and read it; she finished the series in a week! It took my a bit longer than that for the fact that I had school work on top of all of it, but nonetheless I finished it. And couldn't help but freak out at the end of every book.  When you read The Hunger Games, the phrase, "Everything That Can Go Wrong--Will," is practically the theme. Katniss is constantly barraged with things she needs to evade or counter. Suzanne Collins does a phenomenal job of portraying Katniss' shock, fear, happiness, and every other emotion in between. To quote my mother, "This book can and will be darker, more suspenseful, and far better than Twilight will ever be." And I agree--this book blows Twilight out of the water. It might not have the teenaged Vampires and Werewolves, but it has mysterious boys like Gale and a very interesting love triangle that sucks you in. It's ridiculous how much emotion Suzanne can force out of a reader with just words on a page, but she does it.  Being an aspiring author, I find this book a threshold of great literature. Suzanne Collins--I applaud you for this book. Thank you for the hours of fantastic reading.
So yeah, I have a few dumb prejudices that keep me from almost missing great reads.  Over advertised, "juvenile lit", written by female authors is one of them.  Perhaps its the Twilight teen angst that turns me away, but if it smells like teen spirit, it takes a lot of pursuading for me to give it a read.  Then the owner of my local pizza shop sees me reading my Kindle and we get to talking.  Seems we both agree they are addictive as crack and have found ourselves reading more outside our standard comfort zones.  When asked for his top recommendation...Hunger Games.  Suddenly, it doesn't seem so teen-angsty.  So I buy it, read it in one day (in near as one sitting as my schedule allows) and I can't believe I almost let it slip by. Ms. Collins has done more with her chosen plot and characters than you can possibly imagine.  I audibly gasped several times in the book, and was brought near the brink of tears (I am a 40+ y.o. male) in at least two sections.  The future world and its paranoid government control is as brilliant as any dystopian future Orwell or Huxley portrayed.  And the  simple Shirley Jackson's The Lottery meets The Running Man premise is so expertly executed that besides being entertaining it offers a very biting social commentary on the obsessions of today and their possible effects on our future. The main character displays her teenage concerns side by side with her very real kill or be killed dilemna in a way that is not only plausible, but endearing.  So please, don't let any bias you may have cause you to miss a great read.  Like Lilian Hearn's Ortori saga, or Rowling's Potter collection, this first book indicates a series that has the ability to transcend its genre and "teen friendly" trappings to become something so much more...a true work of literature and a great read.  PS As of this writing I am a third through the second book of the series and have found that the author's talents have continued to grow.
How would you like to be stuck in an arena with a bunch of bloodthirsty kids set out to see you dead? Well that's what sixteen year old Katniss must face, but for her surviving is second nature. Suzanne Collins has written three hundred seventy four magnificent pages in the Hunger Games.   This book was great from the beginning. Katniss Everdeen lives with her mother and little sister Prim. Katniss has taken care of her family since she was eleven; since her father died in a mining explosion. To survive she hunts illegally with her bow and best friend Gale. Katniss lives in District Twelve,the coal mining district the poorest district. This particular day was the day of the reaping, where twenty four kids (one girl and one boy from each district), go to the Hunger Games. Prim is entered once and Katniss is entered twenty two times, because of the age difference and tesserae. Effie Trinket the announcer for District twelve reaches her hand in the bowl containing thousands of names and calls "Prim Everdeen" Katniss volunteers then the boy who's called is Peeta who gave Katniss some bread that pretty much saved her life.   I loved the part of the book where Katniss goes into training alone with the gamemakers(the people that make the Hunger Games).She shows them what she's best at and that's shooting a bow "n" arrow. She's the last one in the room alone with the gamemakers, their drunk and aren't paying attention. Katniss gets mad, really mad and shoots an arrow at the gamemakers which hits an apple that a gamemakers eating and she walks away from the gamemakers who have shocked expressions.   The Capitol the -the head of Panem- is a really bad place. For one they make children go to the Hunger Games(a fight to the death) and have so much food but still let the people in poorer districts starve. I didn't know how the author could've made a place so bad, but the more I think about it, it just made the book better.  Suzanne Collins has written two other masterpieces within this series. These are Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Both will have you reading for hours on edge   If you can read you better read this book. You'll feel like you're in the arena with Katniss, almost dead, just made a kill or even a friend. If you can take these feelings and many more pick up the Hunger Games.
I've been hearing good things about The Hunger Games for a couple of years now, and I always meant to read it, but never got the chance. Now that the final book in the trilogy, Mockingjay, is about to make its way into anxious fans' hands at midnight release parties across the country, I figured it was time to start the series and see if it lived up to all the hype.  The story takes place in an undetermined future where Panem, "the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America", and its central Capitol rules over 12 outlying Districts, each of which is required to send one boy and one girl each year to participate in The Hunger Games. Broadcast nation-wide, the Games feature the 24 "tributes" battling to the death, with the winner being set for life, and bringing wealth and glory back to their District.  We follow Katniss Everdeen, tribute from District 12, as she is thrust into the games, and fights, literally and figuratively, to stay alive, and to somehow show the Capitol that the people are not totally at their mercy.  On the positive side, I read three-quarters of book in one day; it's written that well. The story moves quickly, and had enough action and little "twists" to keep it interesting. The world of The Hunger Games, and it's 12 Districts, is well fleshed-out, even though most of our interaction is with just a few characters.  The negative side isn't so much a negative per se, it's just a matter of perceptions; it's very much a "young adult" novel. Don't get me wrong; I love YA fiction, some of my favorite post-apocalyptic books are YA. But you have to realize going in that some of the details of the story may be "smoothed over" so to speak, and there may be elements of the plot that don't seem very realistic, but are necessary for the story to progress.  For example, the District where Katniss lives has been sending two of it's children to die every year for 75 years. But there's no talk of families trying to flee, or anguished mothers wailing in grief as their child's name is called at the Reaping. And after being chosen, Katniss, and the other tributes, don't seem to be really taking the situation seriously. If I knew I had barely a few weeks to live, and was likely to die a horrible death, I'd be haunted, and would devote every waking moment to planning and strategizing. Katniss and the other characters acknowledge that they're not likely to win the Games, but almost seem to brush off that fact. And the interaction between Katniss and the Gamemakers and the Capitol is a bit simplistic and contrived.  But like I said, as long as you know going in what you're likely to get, none of that really matters. Even though you know the chances of a 16 year old girl challenging a long-standing dystopic government hover around zero, you can still cheer for her each time she's able to stick it to them, however unlikely it would be. You can enjoy it simply as an action story where the underdog makes good, and where personal independence trumps the evil Big Brother government.  So even though I doubt that when I get to book 3, I'm going to think of it as "the end of an era", I'm definitely looking forward to finishing the series, and seeing what happens to Katniss and those around her.
From the ashes of the civilization that was once North America came the Capitol, nestled high in the Rocky Mountains. Surrounding the Capitol are the thirteen Districts. As time passed, the Districts rebelled against the Capitol's harsh rule. Their punishment was the creation of The Hunger Games. Each year each District is required to send one boy and one girl to the Capitol, and there they will be thrown together in an arena and forced to fight to the death. Their fight is broadcasted on live television, and each citizen from all Districts is forced to watch.  In isolated District 12, Katniss Everdeen passes her days in school and illegally hunting in the woods beyond the fence that encompasses their community, scavenging and bringing down game to sustain her family. But when her younger sister is chosen to represent their district in the games, Katniss wastes no time in taking her place, even though she knows it mean near certain death. But when circumstances beyond her control twist the Games around, she'll have to fight against both the Games and what she knows is right in her heart to keep her life. One thing is for certain--people will remember this year's Games for a very long time.  Suzanne Collins has created an absorbing and utterly fascinating look at a futuristic world where a government has employed a brutal and heartless system in order to maintain complete respect. She paints a picture of a plausible future, adding to it interesting tidbits of information that you would come to expect of your average science fiction novel--mutant species, hoverboards--while at the same time showing readers a simpler view of life--homes without hot waters and towns barely able to feed themselves.  Collins' heroine Katniss Everdeen is a fierce and determined, angry at the ways of the Capitol, but conscious of the fact that there is nothing that she can do to protest. Her fear is tangible as she approaches the Games, and her wonder at a lush life in the city infectious. However, she really shines as she is immersed in the Games, where her wit and intelligence make themselves known, without understating the fact that she is a scared girl, struggling for survival. Hers is a coming of age story as she is forced to decide what she believes in and act accordingly amidst brutal circumstances.  Though the book doesn't introduce topics with quite as much depth as expected, it doesn't avoid them all together. Katniss's insecurities about death and love, for instance are still very present, and it is evident that throughout the story the author is laying the groundwork for the next two books in the Trilogy.  With an unexpected ending, dashes of tongue in cheek humor, and lots of quick thinking and riveting, suspenseful moments, The Hunger Games succeeds in capturing attention, and provoking thoughts. In its own way, it ranks high up along with Scott Westerfeld's Uglies series and Neil Shusterman's Unwind; a completely scintillating book and wholly promising start to what's sure to be a spectacular trilogy.
Let me preface this review by stating that this was my first exposure to Suzanne Collins' work, having not read her Overland Chronicles series, and I am so enrapt by this piece, that I have gone out and purchased the first book in that particular series.  I will also admit, normally I am not inclined to pick up a book from the young adult genre for personal reading, but this work has changed my entire outlook on that decision.  I am now considering expanding my repertoire to this genre and exploring other works that are out there, as this one book has truly changed my manner of thinking.  Without giving away any spoilers (as I know personally I abhor having a surprise ruined for me), I will restate what the book jacket essentially tells the reader.  Kat is a resident of District 12, the last of several districts who are under the boot of the Capitol.  In her world where starvation is accepted as a daily occurrence, she finds herself forced into the Hunger Games, a sick and twisted creation of the Capitol devised to remind the twelve districts that they are never in control of their destinies.  It is a perverse ritual that pits 11-17 year-olds against one another in a literal fight to the death.  One cannot help to make some slight connection with today's reality shows, but the Hunger Games takes this concept to the extreme level.  From the onset, we are then introduced to a fascinating, intriguing, sickening and emotionally charged dystopia of near epic proportions.  Though this may be a work of young adult fiction, there is no lack of grit, violence imagery and raw emotion, as teenagers struggle to come to terms with a violent and harsh reality that is their world.  Innocence becomes a lost concept; reality turns into `surreality'; the Hunger Games have begun, and it seems that no one is safe in this future.  The writing is very fast-paced.  I was able to finish this book with considerable ease, but I do hope that does not prove a detraction for anyone.  While it might not be on the same literary level as Orwell or Huxley, the content certainly ranks up there with those giants of a disturbingly-crafted future.  There are some 'Big Brother' elements, as well as the forced duty of a helpless populace.  While I may be trying not to give away any surprises, Collins herself also only feeds us facts and details about this world in small doses, which might perhaps be for the best.  I was personally made physically uncomfortable when reading about the horrors of this new world.  Perhaps this is not the lightest subject for young adults to read, but at the same time, maybe this is an important lesson in order that we control ourselves in the future.  A quick read, a marvelous fiction, and a cast of characters that is easy to identify with make The Hunger Games one of the best books I have had the pleasure to read in some time.  Please don't let the targeted age range turn you away; this is a book for all generations.  Given its easy of reading, I think it would be an outstanding addition to any book club reading list, personal collection, school curriculum, or the like.  Put this one on the same shelf as 1984 and Brave New World, as it certainly deserves a place among the most popular dystopias of all time.  (One last note, I am hoping that this is only the first book of a new series by Collins.  If this first opus is any indication of what's to follow, then I am most eager to learn more about the world she has created, and the characters introduced in THG.  If she prefers to shift gears into another district and another group of characters, then I will perhaps even be more enticed to read further; the more light she can shed on this future of ours, the more excited I am to be reading these works).
The Hunger Games by FAR is the best book I have ever read. I read this when I was in 5th grade, and my mom wouldn't let me read it till she'd read it first. Many people hate this book before they even read it, it's NOT. THAT.BAD. The book, yes, is framed around the factor 'kids killing kids'. Thats not the point, their forced to do it. They're doing it to survive, and in the book most of those kids don't even WANT to kill. The first time I read this I couldn't put it down, it's a very very very very good book. Well written and perfect for a Book Report(Trust me, A+ Experience ;) ).  However the context is very graphic and gory, and I wouldn't recommend it to any kid under the age of 12, or in 4th grade or younger. Once you get into the book it's hard to get out, as the series progresses it gets more gruesome. So I strongly suggest you  make a descion if you/ or your child should read this. Many of my friends say they are two 'scared' to read it because it will give them nightmares. This IS partly true. There are 3 times in the book were it DOES get very detailed in gore, which alone gave me nightmares. However if your not bothered by this then, by all means! Go ahead! But parents, I'm a Christian, and I don't agree with all of this. However this book has many good point of views. So make your choice before you read it please!
I really liked this book!  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins rocks!  The book is fast paced with lots of action and you really get to know, like and dislike the characters.  The story takes place in the future where life is hard.  There are 12 districts that are all very different, producing special goods depending on where they are located.  These districts must all give up one male and one female known as tributes to fight to the death in the Hunger Games.  All this occurs on live TV. These games are designed by the government to keep the districts in line.  There is a lot of hype associated with the games and the tributes are considered celebrities.  The two main characters are Katniss and Peeta.  They come from a poor mining district where Katniss has struggled her whole life.  Along the way she has picked up cool skills like hunting with her bow and knowing how to track and these end up helping her survive the Hunger Games.  I really liked Katniss.  She is tough but also had a soft side which I think Peeta brings out in her.  My favorite part of the book is the action of the games.  Don't get me wrong, this book is very violent and bloody and many people die as they struggle to survive in the Hunger Games.  So read with caution because it can be intense.  Overall all the hunger Games leaves you hungry for more!
Well-written, engaging and surprising.  I feel like I could talk about the themes and cultural significance of this book at length, but given its popularity, I know I wouldn't be the first. The only thing I have to add that may not have been said before is that I was surprised and delighted by the author's attitudes towards human bodies.  SO much of pop culture is saturated by a concern for how we look and what other people think of us. Katniss is a breath of fresh air - a girl who is self-possessed and has no doubts about her right to exist in her own body, about the *rightness* of that body and what she can do with it.  Katniss's perspective on the way that Capitol citizens decorate and change their bodies from their natural states is, quite frankly, refreshing. It's subtle, but for me it absolutely made the book. There is no body-shaming anywhere to be found, no value placed on looks, only on strength of character.  What also struck me is that Collins handles the delicate situations where one could infer sexual intimacy between characters in a demure and delicate manner, allowing the reader to infer it if they so desire.  Bottom line - I wouldn't hesitate to hand this to a girl of ANY age and recommend she read it. I'm sure that I'll be reading it again myself, many times.
When I started reading this eBook, my first thought was, who comes up with this stuff?!?!!  Our world in the future, a government who uses the self-killing children of its land to yearly remind its people that you shouldn't rise against the government...  Boy do I wish I had this type of imagination.  I got hooked right in.  My sister-in-law recommended it about a year ago, and I finally got some free time.  The characters are well developed, the foundation was well thoughtout, the intensity started in the first chapter.  I could barely put the book down.  I am a very slow reader, often used to proof-read others' materials because I read every "and", "the" and "to".  I read this book in three days!!  A personnal record for this slow reader, I am sure.  I couldn't believe the next chapter and the next chapter after that.  Shock, awe, confusion, questions, intensity, insanity.  It really was good.  Had to learn a few new phrases and terminology, but after a while, it was second hand.  The ending was totally worth the wait.  LOVE IT.  Thanks to my SIL for recommending the series.  I would definitely recommend this book.  I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.  The eBook was great, I didn't feel I missed anything by not having the actual book in my hand (in case you are on the fence).
I'm writing about the hunger games I was practically held at gun point and forced to read it so a 3 star rating should be seen as a high honor considering I had no other options. I'll start off by giving a brief summary of the story, the main characters name is Katniss and she lives in a post war world in which the government has total control of 12 districts. They exploit the total control by forcing 24 children to fight to the death every year. Katnisses sister is chosen to be one of the 24 children but Katness volunteers instead. Her partner in the fight is a boy who saved her family by throwing her bread years ago. They go through brief training and are put into a computer controlled arena in which they fight the other 22 children to the death.    In my opinion the book has its "wow this is boring!" mements and its "wow thats cool" moments. But in my opinion the book was slightly boring and drawn out with a few enjoable moments. I would reccomend this book to 5-8th grade girls which seems to be the target audence anyway. The plot is quite intresting because its relateable to what might happen if the govenment goets to big/Obama gets reelected. The whole idea of a government nuking its own people is quite intrested.The world in which this oocures seems to be similar to fallout 3/fallout new vegas atmosphere
This was such a great book, I don't know where to begin.  When I read the insert of this book, I thought it would be just an ok read, something to fill the time in between my other books.  I was so wrong!  It's such a great book, Suzanne Collins truly describes a post North American society that is so creative and believable.  The main character, Katniss, is young and truly likable without being overly "good" and "innocent".  She's a survivor, she's strong and caring and fiercely loyal and defensive of those she loves.  I love Peeta and Gale, they are the type of guys you want to fall in love with, the problem is you wish they could be rolled up into one person.  One is so sweet and caring and has no problems being open about his love an affection, the other is so strong and dependable and just enough manliness in him so that you feel safe and secure.  I haven't decided who I want Katniss to end up with, they are both such great guys!  And all this romance and intermal struggle that Katniss has to figure out while being thrown into an arena with 23 other people for a fight to the death......it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I read until 2AM, I could have kept on going, but I have to work in the morning and I have a 20 month year old toddler that doesn't let mommy stop for naps.  GREAT READ, HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
In "The Hunger Games," Suzanne Collins has created the finest young-adult dystopian novel since "The Giver," and in fact one of the most solidly enjoyable dystopian novels I've ever read (and I'm a fan of the genre).  Her worldbuilding is solid and involving, and the issues she explores are serious, relevant, and treated with all the nuance they deserve.  Her characters are complex and relatable; the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is easily one of the best-realized characters in juvenile fiction.  Katniss isn't always a likable character - she can be surly, cynical, pragmatically violent - but readers invariably admire her strength, recognize her vulnerability, and come to care deeply about her within a few chapters.  In a novel that was published when "Twilight" frenzy was nearing its peak, it's refreshing to read about a young woman for whom romance is at most a side concern.  As one would expect from a novel about a 24-person televised death match, there's plenty of knuckle-whitening action, and although most of the violence happens offstage, so to speak, there are a few wincingly gruesome scenes.  The story is well-paced, and there's plenty of introspection as well as action.  It all adds up perfectly to a novel that's hard to put down (I read most of it in one sitting the first time around).  Don't miss it.
On one hand, I'm much too old to be considered the 'target audience' for this series of books.  But, on the other hand, the first several recommendations I got for this series were from other readers in my own age group, so I gave in and bought the trilogy before a long plane trip.  Suffice it to say that I started reading two days before my departure, and I was so completely sucked in that I finished Book 1 and had to start Book 2 less than 2 hours into the 13 hour flight.  Thank goodness I had plenty of other reading material on my Kindle, because I devoured all three books long before my return flight!  The stories in this series are really captivating, and the only reason they seem to fall into the 'young adult' category is because they contain no sex or profanity to speak of, their protagonists are mostly under 20 years old, and because they're complexly disguised morality tales.  But I'd say that anyone who appreciates a good adventure could enjoy this series.  My only tiny criticism is that I felt Book 1 was the best.  Book 2 was good, but there were a couple of instances of 'information dumping', where it seemed the author got bored, or needed a good night's sleep, or just wanted to get some info out of the way.  Book 3 was fine, necessary, but not as well written as Book 1.
I bought this as a gift for my husband and was sure he would hate it. But it turns out we both loved it and continued on to read the rest of the series. This one is by far the best though. Highly recommend.
What can I say, I did not immediately jump on the "Hunger Game" train when the books were released. A few friends encouraged me to read the series, but I honestly did not think I would enjoy them. Boy, was I wrong! This book completely took me by surprise. I could hardly put the book down and everything about it left me wanting more. So, it's no surprise that as soon as I was finished wit this book, I immediately moved on to the second in the series (which is just as good, I must say!).  The book is basically about a girl named Katniss Everdeen who resides in District 12 within the nation of Panem. Each year, each district must select one male and one female (or tributes, if you will) to compete in the 'Hunger Games', where they will compete against the other competitors in each district and must survive until they are the last one standing. By a twisted turn of events, Katniss is elected the female tribute for District 12. This first book tells the story of Katniss's struggle to not only survive in the Hunger Games, but also keep her friends and family alive.  My message to anyone that thinks this series isn't for them: give it a try. I think this series as a little bit of something for everyone - romance, action, adventure, and SO much more.  Would DEFINITELY recommend!  :)
It isn't the first time that stories or movies have revolved around the idea of throwing people into an arena to fight to the death. Watching people battle to survive for entertainment has happened several times throughout history. The Hunger Games is no exception. Every year one boy and one girl is chosen from each of the twelve districts to fight to become a victor. After her sister's name is selected, Katniss Everdeen volunteers herself as a tribute to protect her sister.  Although her intentions are good and it appears that her heart is the in the right place, I found myself slightly irritated by Katniss. Sure, her heart was in the right place to protect her sister and that was noble. But there are others around her that are doing everything they can to protect her but if she isn't let in on the plans (for her own good) she gets hostile when she should be thanking them.  Out of all of the characters, Peeta is the one I loved the most. He has been watching out for Katniss her entire life, falling more in love with her as the time passes on even though she pays him no attention until after both are tributes. Once in the arena he is still watching over her, risking his own life. His heart and soul are golden and it was nice to see such an amazing character within the story.
I'd heard about this here and there, but never really paid it much attention until a co-worker started talking about it. He spoke glowingly of the book, so I decided to take a peek at it the next time I went shopping. However, when I saw that it was written in first, person present tense, I freaked out a little, because that's not a style I particularly like.  But while waiting for an oil change, I meandered the book section of the store and grabbed a copy and decided to give it a shot again.  Boy, I'm sure glad I did.  Set in the future where the United States no longer exists, the country is divided in to 12 districts. Residents of each district barely scrape by and their lives are harsh. However, each year, two teenagers from every district - a boy and a girl - are chosen to compete against each other in the Hunger Games at the Capitol. These games are brutal and end when only one teen is left standing.  The book had excellent pacing, and the relationships formed early on in the Games allowed the reader to draw insight about each character and determine who to root for and who you hoped didn't make it.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. There are two more in the series, and I can't wait to get started to see how it all ends.
I typically don't read YA books but the movie has caused quite a stir for this novel among young readers and adults and that piqued my interest.  The premise is excellent - a revised North America, post-quelled rebellion, in which the ruling class keep the masses in place by forcing an annual to-the-death competition pitting 12 girls and 12 boys against each other.  It's a solid story and exciting at times but as an adult reader I was hoping for a bit more depth to the characters. I also expected more of a battle between good and evil (in this case the government vs. the beaten down masses) but perhaps that will follow as this is just book 1 of a trilogy.  For me at times the story line seemed to emulate a violent video game more than anything else.  And, yes, I know it's a YA book so I make this comment merely to alert other adult readers who are certain to read it as well.  It IS a good story, I do recommend it to other adults and I will read book 2.  A note to parents of teen readers: there is a good amount of violence and death so it may be more intense than many of the stories your children typically read.  A final comment: for those readers who really enjoy PA books and want a novel that I found to be much more riveting, I highly recommend The Stand by Stephen King.
Ever since I heard about The Hunger Games, I've debated on reading the series or not.  Part of me feared it would be a lot like the Twilight Series - which everyone raved about, but when I attempted to read left me entirely dissatisfied and disappointed - but, after hearing recommendations for the trillionth time, I finally sucked it up and downloaded a sample for this, the first book in the series.  Let me tell you, I am so happy I bought the book, and the two that follow.  This series left me touched, made me cry and laugh and groan.  There were some areas that got a bit frustrating for me as a reader (such as Katniss' romantic life, and her constant confusion over it) but in a way that was annoying because it was so real; what sixteen year old girl doesn't have those annoying mental conversations with herself, especially when it comes to a boy she likes?  Having experienced a few of the things mentioned in the book (such as dehydration) I can say that Suzanne Collins really did her research.  All the characters, Katniss in particular, read as very human and you end up in love with not only her, but all of them.  You cheer for them, you cry for them, and you wish, desperately, that things were different.  Honestly, this series ranks up there with Harry Potter for me personally!!
This is a three volume book. The first book "The Hunger Games" is by far the best, actually outstanding, and clearly should be rated 5 stars except for how disappointed I was in volumes 2 and 3.  The second book, "Catching Fire" is worth reading but not outstanding. I would rate it 3 stars.  The third book, "Mockingjay" was a disappointment. On its own, I would rate it 1 star; 2 stars at the most. In fact, I only finished reading it because of how Book 1 captured my interest and book 2 held it. By its own merit, I would not have finished the book and perhaps I shouldn't have bothered.  However, I wanted to read to the end after book 1 was so captivating of my interest.  I could not put book 1 down but I stopped reading book 3 several times.  In book 3, the girl, the hero of the story, was hardly that. Instead she spent most of her time being an injured or unable to preform due to regreats and depression.  Furthermore, although she was used as a symbol to encourage the rebels to continue fighting, she was basically under house arrest, unable to even go hunting without a guard and had no more authority than a private in the army.  Perhaps the book was realistic in how war destroys people.  However, you like for your heros to be more than weak crybabies.
I'm still trying to digest this book. I don't typically read science fiction, in fact, I believe it's my first. I only read it because I have 5th graders reading it and parents asking me about it. I avoided it for weeks. It's just not my type of book, but once I started, I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day, and now I know I'll have to read Catching Fire. This is a gripping story that takes a hard look at humanity. It's thought provoking, and rather frightning. I was told it was about "kids killing kids", but in reality it is so much more. The layers and depths of this book go far beyond this simple premise. It's like a combination of that story I read in high school, The Lottery, and the one about the hunter becoming the hunted (I can't remember the title), The Lord of the Flies, and today's reality shows. Collins blends all of this together with a flavor of 1800's wilderness survival and modern times, but puts the story in a futuristic setting where democracy no longer reigns. This book requires mature thought. It's a rare 5th grader who can read this book and grip its many underlying meanings and layers. I would preserve this for high school. I think it would make an interesting study in (female protagonist) character if you put it together with Graceling by Kristen Cashore.
I debated whether to get this book because of some of the negative reviews regarding the subject matter. On a friend's insistance I bought it and I'm glad I did.  1. This is a YA book appropriate for 13 and up I would guess. The writing is very engaging and thought provoking and would appeal to many adults, especially women (the lead character is female) and those who like futuristic, survivalist, apocalyptic tales. It reminded me of Logan's Run if you are old enough to remember the 1970's film and tv show.  2. It gets 5 stars not because it is groundbreakingly inventive or the best book ever written but because it is a simple tale constructd incredibly well. It is a page turner and I finished it in 2 days.  3. Regarding the subject matter: I will try not to be a spoiler here. It is not as gruesome and barbaric as I thought it would be. Killings are justified on behalf of the lead character - we are with her in spirit when she does what she has to do. Nothing is gratuitous.  4. I did laugh a few times at the plot, especially in the first third of the book. But if you can get over some of the over the top stuff, it is an enjoyable ride. and for any thinking person, there's a real trilogy here and you can begin to guess and wonder on how it will unfold in future books.
Wow. I'm at a loss of words. This was amazing. When I first finished it, I thought it was a bit disturbing, but after reading the second and eventually third book, I fell in love with the series. I immediatly went and saw the movie. The best possible actors are in it. It couldn't have been better. I'm trying to persuade my mom to take me to the movie again :) What I recommend: Read the first book. Give it a couple of days to sink in. Go find the second and third books. Do not start reading the second book unless you have the thid right next to you. Read and enjoy. Go see the movie ASAP. Go see the movie again. Watch the movie one more time. Reread the series twice. Become obsessed. NEVER read any of the parodies. Meet Suzanne Collins. Take up archery lessons. Become amazing at archery. Find out where it is and move to District 12. Name your children after the characters. Hunt with a bow and arrow. Learn how to make Katniss's favorite dish properly. Never ever stray away from the Hunger Games or I will come find you and annoy you until you promise to stay with the Hunger Games for the rest of your life. Do all of this and you will have a wonderful amazing life :)  Hunger Games  Katniss+Peeta=Love  Katniss+Gale=Kisses  GO HUNGER GAMES!!!!!!!!
The Hunger Games takes place in a futuristic setting where the government forces children to have an annual fight to the death as punishment for the past generations wrong doing. The last person standing is the winner. This battle is broadcasted live on national television as entertainment. Each person must decide what type of contender they will be; deceitful or honorable.  This book is a dystopia, but also contains a bit of romance and action. It has a little bit of everything in it. Some books are really difficult to get into, but this is not one of them. I was interested right from the beginning. When I began reading, it was practically impossible to put the book down. This is the first book in The Hunger Games trilogy. As the trilogy progresses, the plot gets stronger and more desirable. The only thing is, the writing style is a bit young. The book was written for teens/young adults, so the vocabulary is not very complex.  I would definitely recommend The Hunger Games to anyone who likes a good dystopia. If you are looking for a novel with stronger vocabulary, however, you might not find it as enjoyable as others. Nevertheless, if you enjoy a mix of action and romance, I encourage you to read this book. You will not be disappointed.
I know I'm in the minority, but I can't like this book or this series.  Frankly, I gave it 2 stars because while I don't like it and there are major flaws, it wasn't horrific, which is what a 1 star book would be for me.  There are alot of reasons I don't like this book/series, and all of them are listed in my in-depth review on my blog  http:[...]  But, here are the highlights:  1. I can't make myself like Katniss.  She is an emotionally distant, cold, almost sociopathic girl with no understanding of the things happening around her.  2. All the other characters are so shallow that they can be summed up in one or two adjectives and it would be the extent of the character in total.  For instance: Peeta is the baker's son who likes to bake, frost cakes, paint, and he loves Katniss for some reason.  And that's it.  That's Peeta.  3. The story was really just a derivative premise and everything else is an attempt to stretch that cool idea (kids killing each other in high tech arenas for the amusement of the rich) into a trilogy.  It felt fake and forced.  So, I know most everyone loves it.  Some have even said that it changed their lives.  For those people, good for you.  I know books have that power.  I have felt similarly at times, but alas, not this time.
A really entertaining and exciting teen read that's far edgier than I expected. Any number of people have already made the connection to Battle Royale, but reading The Hunger Games not two days after watching the film again made the connection seem very obvious. After all, both are about a government attempting to keep its population in line via a brutal competition; both feature teenagers and young children battling to the death; both feature shocking displays of violence from said young people. But for all the hoopla and complaints, the tone, execution, and themes of the two pieces couldn't be more different. The Hunger Games plays the competition far more seriously than Royale, eschewing the latter's social satire in favor of focusing on the effect of this warfare on those who participate. Beyond that, Hunger Games touches on the psychological warfare of government, the power of media, and even the effectiveness of propaganda. To be sure, there's a couple of teen-bait plot threads involving romance, but they don't reduce from the overall greatness of the book. Hunger Games is surprisingly unflinching and creates a fascinating world I'm very curious about, and sets up enough interesting plot threads to leave me very ready to check out book two of the series.
I just finished reading Collins' The Hunger Games for the second time in a few months, finding that I loved it even more the second time.  The first time, I was so fraught with worry for the characters that I couldn't fully appreciate the complexity of the character development and the details of the plotting.  When a friend first described this book to me by saying "it's about a future world where the government forces 24 teenagers to travel to a huge arena and fight to the death," I didn't even try to hide my eye rolling.  "That sounds terrible," I groaned.  She finally convinced me to try it: "Just read a chapter or two and see what you think," she urged.  Well, she couldn't have been more right . . . I only had to read a few pages of this book to get fully engrossed and hooked.  Yes, the premise is brutal and repellant.  Yes, the book contains a lot of graphic violence.  Yes, you will be disgusted by the insensitivity and selfishness of the government in this dystopian society.  And, yes, you won't be able to put it down.  Don't believe me?  Just read a chapter or two and see if I'm wrong!  You can thank me later . . . and now if you'll excuse me, I have a friend that I need to thank.
Two years ago I finally got around to reading "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card. Prior to recently reading "The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins, Ender's Game was the first young adult novel I read as an "adult". And while it too lived up to its reputation, by the time I got around to reading it, I was fairly intimate with the plot, characters, setting, etc (there were very few surprises left). By comparison, I went into The Hunger Games with little to no expectations, untainted by the fine opinion of other readers. On a related side note, it was also the first book (outside Known Afterlife) that I read on my Kindle.  I am a sucker for most any dystopia settings, throw in a strong but vulnerable heroine and some suspenseful action, and you pretty much "had me at hello". Suzanne Collins strikes a perfect balance of showing and describing, providing the reader just enough to stoke the edges of imagination. The pace of prose and simple but elegant writing sucked me in out the gate, finishing the book in less then a week. A week post finishing the book and I am still thinking about the story, a true measure of a great book no matter what the targeted demographic.  I plan on reading the sequels as well adding a few more YA books to my every growing TBR list.
I saw the movie first. Yes I know taboo really. But I had grown sick and tired about hearing how great this book was. It was becoming the new Twilight and I couldn't stand it. (That being said see the movie first, more suspense really). Now the book. This is a sleek and fast read. I really didn't want to like this book and by the end of chapter one I was cursing how good this book was. The hype is understandable, this is a brutal story with a fantastic underlying commentary.  The story is, as most everyone knows by now, about Katniss Everdeen. A young girl from district twelve. One of the desolate districts where finding dinner is a challenge. She volunteers for her sisters place in the hunger games. A worldwide event in which twenty four kids between twelve and eighteen fight to the death for glory and the entertainment of the capital. This was a horrible summary but it's all I've got at the moment.  The story is fast and has a great pace leaving the reader wondering where the last few hours had gone. Collins does a great job making this book accessible and as endearing to adults as well as to the teens it's aimed at. It's not your average young adult novel and it's heaps and bounds better than most out there. The hype is worth it.
The setting and set up is neat, but the story is very light and is basically the same as Battle Royale. I would recommend that book before this one; this is more like fluff than actual substance.
The secret to a reader believing in something is all in the writing.  If the author uses finesse and imagination to create a world different to our own and includes elements we can relate to, then when we are caught up in fiction we are so involved we forget to question what is real or what is not.  Those elements are there and we find ourselves thinking that if we don't change things in this world now then we may end up in that other world. It is a fine line at times between fiction and reality.  Did I love this book?  Absolutely! It is brutal and yet poignant and we live and breathe every step of the games with Katniss.  There is so much in all the characters that connects to our daily lives.  Fear for our families well-being both in the present and the future, responsibility, the desire to flee from unpleasantness and the ability to find courage under incredible circumstances.  The book has a freshness in its story, a capitvating style in which to display it and contains a down to earth approach in plot and syntax that is totally fascinating in its ability to be believable.  I know it was written for young adults but this book transcends age, so much so I had already downloaded the second book before I was half-way with this one. Wow! Read it.
Amazing. I'd seen the first two movies before reading the series.  You'll understand Katniss so much better for reading the series.  Seeing the movies didn't ruin a thing for me.  Love Love Love.
Patrick.M-The Hunger Games is a great book. Suzanne Collins has written the best book ever to me. The Hunger Games (book 1) and Catching Fire (book 2) are full of action, romance, and adventure. Other authors have read this book and they loved it. Here is a review from J.K. Rowling. "I couldn't stop reading it. At dinner I hid it under my chair". I am a 5th grader and I agree and love the books.   The stories are about a girl named Katniss Everdeen. This book takes place in the future. There are 12 Districts and one Capitol. 74 years before the Districts tried to rebel against the Capitol. The Capitol won and for punishment they created the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are simple. One girl and one boy from each district are thrown into an arena from a frozen wasteland to a desert. The rules are simple the point is it's a fight to the death and the last one standing wins.   The book is great once you start you can't stop. Also don't let it get to your mind. Don't read it if your younger than 11. The book ends in disaster so you have to read The Hunger Games then Catching Fire and wait tell August 2010 for book 3. I will wait 100 years just to read book 3. READ READ Suzanne Collins books, The Hunger Games (book 1) and Catching Fire (book 2).
The Hunger Games was quite a page turner, and while I did enjoy it, I didn't quite love the book.  I'm not going to go through the plot as quite a few people have read it, or if they haven't, there are plenty of sources to find that information. I will say that the plot was, in my view, the best part of the book. As I said above, it's quite a page turner, but although I didn't think the writing was bad per se, I didn't feel it was up to par with The Giver by Lois Lowry or The House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer. The romance angle in the book irritated me a bit. I understand to a degree why it was necessary to the plot, but I thought it could have been a little more well done. Another minor irritation was the naming of the characters in the book. I suppose it was done on purpose, but I felt it distracted me from the story every time I came upon a strange name. I've never really noticed it in books like Lord of the Rings, etc., but in this book the names just seemed a bit silly.  Even with all that said, I did like the book quite a bit and plan on reading the entire trilogy. I hate to be too negative when I actually enjoyed it, but since it's received so many rave reviews, I just thought I'd explain why my rating was a little lower.
I was trying to figure out whet drew me to this story, as I usually avoid "popular" things. Katniss is a very colorful character &amp; blissfully un-Mary-Sue-like; she's caustic, bounces back &amp; forth between pessimism &amp; optimism, self-sufficient, socially awkward, strategic, uncourteous, cautious, street-smart, brash, &amp; petulant.  For me, the book touched on things I've seen or read in my own childhood, making it a little nostalgic. The political aspect was reminiscent of George' Orwell's 1984, while the actual games reminded me of the Hunter Trials from the first story arc in the 2001 (not the 2011 remake) "Hunter x Hunter."  I guess the only thing I didn't like was how much emphasis went into Katniss sleeping &amp; eating, sleeping &amp; eating, sleeping &amp; eating. I think I've gained weight just reading about all the food she consumes every 5 minutes.  I also like the way The Capitol was used to mock popularity &amp; the celebrity lifestyle....Gaudy fashions, pretentiousness, spending stupid amounts of money on petty things, false friends, fleeting admiration, pretending to be something you're not &amp; telling people what they want to hear in order to be popular. If the Games were highschool, the Careers would have been the Preppies.
I began reading this book three days ago and finished it today.  It is an excellent book, well-written and engaging.  I hung on every word and i think that the true mark of a good book is that feeling when you say "I'm going to read until 6pm" then comes 7 and you're still reading until finally its 10PM and you're wondering where the last 4 hours went.  The Hunger Games was that book for me, easily the most enjoyable book i have read in a while.  However, that doesn't mean it is without flaw.  In my eyes, the only true problem with this book was the ending.  I understand it is a lead-in to a whole new book (Catching-Fire) but i feel that the ending to the Games themselves was a bit confusing, and therefore a bit anti-climatic.  I had to read it twice to know what was really going on and it just seemed to me that it could have been done better a different way.  But, I am a fan of the "Final Showdown" so when I was robbed of it in this instance, it turned me off a little bit.  Hopefully, you know what i am talking about if you have read it.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't.  Overall though, I am intrigued by the book and will be purchasing the 2nd book soon.  As soon as i get my vision back from reading this one lol.
I was a little hesitant about this book at first.  I assumed it was going to be good, but I didn't know how good it would be.  There was so much hype about it, that I was afraid I would begin reading it and find myself disappointed.  But oh, was I wrong.  I absolutely loved this novel.  From the first pages, it had me.  And let me say to all of you that have yet to read it...  believe the hype.  Give yourself up to it and just read it already.  The main thing I loved about this book was that it wasn't easy to figure out.  You didn't know what was going to happen until it happened, or how things were going to happen.  You were basically left in the dark with no choice but to continue reading.  I was kept guessing on every single page.  The Hunger Games is very well written.  Whether it's the horridity of the violence and the Games, or the heart and emotion you feel as you read on about the individual characters.  It was easy to get sucked in and you remained there until the end.  Another thing that stood out to me about this novel was the lack of romance.  Of course, there's a little romance in the novel, but only a tiny portion.  It doesn't take center stage and demand all the attention.  The book itself does not revolve around lust and love like most do.  I love my love stories, but this book was a bit refreshing in that sense.  I loved this book so much and it is so different from anything I've read recently.  As soon as I finished the last page, I honestly wanted to throw myself right into book two, Catching Fire.  This book really does live up to the hype.
First of all I would like to clear up certian things popping up in the negative reviews.  1. This isn't a post-apocolyptic world, its following the collapse of the U.S. If you want world-in-disaster go read The Maze Runner Series.  2. For those who believe that this would never happen, I hate to burst your bubble but, it did. In the ancient Roman times and in Dictator Joseph Stalin's time, the people bent on power would kill there rivals by making them commite suicide. How? The most important thing to sane people is there families. The people who wanted them dead would threaten to kill their families if they didn't kill themselves first. Also today people threaten to kill families if they don't get what they want. This book just has a different senerio to show it.  Enough with the History lesson, this book is amazing. Full of twists and turns and well, practically everything that makes up a best seller.  Refering to my title, I really have never read anything like this and even when the knock-offs come they will be just that. When abook makes someone cry you know its good and at one part, I cried like a baby. Rather than reading my review you should be reading the book. Its worth it I promise.
I am just finishing the last few pages of the last book in this 3 book series.  I picked up the Hunger Games thinking my teenage daughter might like it.  I brought it home and perused the covers, then sat down and read the first few pages...then couldn't put it down again.  I had to scramble to find the remaining two books because I had no idea when I purchased it, that there were two more, ugh...but, Amazon delivered those quickly enough.  They are mesmerizing, a great fast read.  I can't remember in my half century, when I have been so enthralled with a book, if ever, let alone a 3 book series.  I highly recommend this book series.  I've loved all three books tremendously and am sad there isn't more.  To be so lost in a story that holds you on that you can't put it down is rare.  I do however disagree with one other review that stated the story was gruesome in nature.  It's a book about people trying to save themselves and their world, with a young female adult at the helm of the storyline. A girl who is immature, naive, and sassy.  It is not a Steven King horror novel, nor is it as horrific and distubing to read as one reader described.  It is an easy and enjoyable read for young adults to any age.  Hope you agree.
This is one of those books, like the Harry Potter series, that adults should read also.  Don't let the category fool you in to missing an excellent book.  Since there have been plenty of reviews of this book already, I will simply touch briefly on the main topic already covered and why you shouldn't care.  On the book being not entirely original.  Yes, this book is reminiscent of "The Most Dangerous Game", "The Lottery", "The Long Walk", and "The Running Man".  It doesn't matter.  The take is unique enough and the add-ons original enough that you find yourself not caring, even if you have previously read all 4 of the stories mentioned above.  Since the first two of these stories are considered classic literature, it should give you an idea that the topics resonate enough to have a lasting impact.  Many greats works can be considered derivative if you go back far enough.  For those who read this book and enjoy it, but haven't read the 4 mentioned stories, I highly encourage you to read them.  Two of them can be found in one book: The Bachman Books : Four Early Novels by Richard Bachman (Rage / The Long Walk / Roadwork / The Running Man) This is Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman.
When a friend first told me about The Hunger Games I thought, "yuck!"  No way, was I going to read it.  The way she described it made it sound like a gladiator-style, Survivor (the TV show) type book. I didn't want to waste my time with it. I mean, I just had read all the Twilight books and was mourning the loss of them and I wanted and needed something great to fill the void.  She persisted and eventually won. I read them. I have loved the book ever since.  Why do I love it so? Katniss. She is why I love the book.  Katniss is a strong, resourceful, dependable, confidant, yet naive and a very strong-willed girl. Who wouldn't love those qualities? She also loves her sister Prim and would do anything for her, which is evident throughout the book. The most notable is when Katniss takes Prims place in the reaping. Katniss also doesn't realize it, but she has an effect on people. People from the Hob, her friend Gale, and Madge the mayor's daughters, to her fellow tribute, Peeta all of whom hold her in high regard. Overall, she is a survivor.  I also have a special place in my heart for Peeta. He is a wholesome, respectable, sweet-hearted young man who cares deeply for Katniss. It melted my heart when I read about the bread he burned for Katniss and the punishment he endured. It also broke my heart to learn that he was never given a gift in the arena, treated as if he was expendable.  Suzanne Collins does an exceptional job of writing a heart-wrenching story set in a dystopian society, where hunger prevails and punishments are severe.
Set in a dystopian future of North America, The Hunger Games follows Kat, Peeta, Prim, and the other youth involved in the barbaric sport to remind Panem of the Capitol's power on a yearly basis. Forced into an arena for all of Panem to see, the "tributes" from each district must fight one another for survival. When Prim, Kat's younger sister, is selected though, Kat takes her place without a second thought. To stay alive and to earn sponsors and gifts, Kat forges and unlikely alliance with Peeta, the tribute boy from her district. More than just one thing threatens their alliance...  Ok, I've heard the most amazzzzinnnggg things about this book, but for some reason I just never got around to buying it. I can't believe I waited so long! I am so dumb! I could not put this book down. The concept, the verbiage, the characters...it's terrifyingly realistic, and it truly is one of the most alive books I've ever read. Suzanne Collins created a tangible masterpiece that is as riveting as it is believable.  This is just the first book in the series, with Catching Fire being the next in the series. I can't wait to read it! I give The Hunger Games a 5 out of 5, and I honestly wouldn't change a single thing about it.
This is a YA book that a parent, teacher or any adult can also love. The plot can be traced to the story of Theseus in classical mythology, an Athenian youth offered as a tribute along with thirteen other young people to go into the labyrinth and be killed by the Minotaur.  Like Theseus, the heroine Katniss represents the best and brightest of young people in her district, and she offers herself in a fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games.  While this might seem like a strange choice to recommend for YA readers, the violence does not dwell on gore or pathological murderers.  My 7th grade students have been obsessed with vampire stories this year, and I believe The Hunger Games has a much more meaningful theme and purpose than those popular novels.  Even during the fighting, Collins' message to the reader is that the "games" are wrong; that they bring out the worst in some people, and compassion and teamwork in others.  Great characters, suspense, sensory details and all the action and romantic tension you could hope for.  In the upcoming sequel, _Catching Fire_, I hope to see Katniss making friends in District 11.  I think there may be more to the story about her father's death in the mine, too.
I haven't read such a remarkable, action-packed, well-written, suspenseful YA book since Harry Potter! I started this book about three days ago, and only put it down when I had to. Here is a non-spoiler summary.  Katniss Everdeen, is a sixteen-year-old, hunter, who lives with her mother and sister in district 12 of Panem: a country that was once known as North America. Every year, a lotto is drawn, and two kids (one of each gender) between the ages of 12-18 are chosen to compete in a tournament known as, The Hunger Games.  This particular year, Kat volunteers to take her younger sister's place after her name was chosen in the draw. She is then paired up with the baker's son, Peeta. Together, the two of them are flown to The Capital, dressed up, and paraded around on live TV. After training, they join the other 24 kids in a gladiator type battle. The last one alive is declared the winner.  This book reminded me of the classic novel, The Deadliest Game. Humans must battle other humans, except The Hunger Games is being broadcast on live TV back home, and all over Panem. I wasn't really expecting the ending, that's how well-written the novel is.  I highly recommend this book.
First of all, I loved this book and couldn't put it down, so I'm giving it five stars. This book had me from start to finish, but there were a couple things that bothered me. There was a point where Katniss had the chance to take out a bunch of participants with her bow and arrow and instead she took out their food. This read to me like one of those horrible scenes in a horror movie where someone is making unbelievably stupid choices. You've got the killer/bad guy right there! Why not just finish him off? If your narrator is going to make choices this ridiculous, the reader needs more reflection from the narrator on his/her reasoning.  Also, the plot gets more predictable the further along you go. About halfway through, I realized there was no way Katniss would kill Rue and that someone else was probably going to take her out. Collins also bends the rules of the Hunger Games to adhere to plot, which to me seems a bit lazy. When the rules were changed so that two people from each district could survive, that sort of took the fun out of it. Why not make the plot more exciting by having only one winner and having the final two work around that? Seems like Collins was looking for an easy happy ending.
I have to admit that when I first heard about the Hunger Games I was confused as to what the fuss was all about. I mean seriously what's so big about kids being forced into a game to the death?? So when I finally got around to buying a Kindle, the Hunger Games, was the first book I sat down to read. Three little letters says it all....OMG!!  Wow I totally ate all the words I said previously about the book. The brief synopsis I read about it did not do it justice at all.  I was immediately intrigued with the main character Katniss, and her relationship with everyone around her. Suzanne does a great job of introducing each and every character and how they relate to her. The descriptions of everything from the way they were dressed, to the description of the food was amazing. I could visualize everything while I was reading it.  The interaction between the characters and the humor was great, I caught myself laughing out loud at parts and crying during others. Yes there is violence, I mean it is a fight to the death, but it's not over done at all that younger teens couldn't read it. There is some romance but it's nicely written and it gives you just enough to imagine how young love starts and feels.
This is a very good book, and very inspirational for young women. It is written for young adults and teenagers.  The main character Katniss is a strong feminine heroin.  The story is told from Katniss's point of view and the reader is really able to imagine the world through her eyes. Katniss is a 17 year old girl living with her mother and a fragile twelve-year-old sister in District 12. Her father was killed in a coal mining accident several years ago, and now Katniss must be the sole provider for her family. She feeds her family by risking her life on a daily basis, hunting illegally in the woods beyond the wire fence that keeps residents from escaping from the District.  Katniss must choose between life, love, and loyalty in a story that makes you question our views of modern entertainment and society.  Katniss is the warrior that every young woman should strive to be. She is very strong spirit who through circumstances beyond her control must rise to the challenges of a harsh life. Not falling back into a state of weakness, but reaching deep within her self to find the will to survive, and by doing so, she shows the reader the true strength and beauty of the feminine human spirit.
Before I read this book all I heard about were the politics that came with it which kind of discouraged me from wanting to read it.  But then I saw the movie was coming out soon and folded to reading it.  I came into reading this book with an attitude expecting it to be a wet-dream of a libtard.  But was surprised and kind of felt foolish.  The stuff this young lady goes through is insane!  I found myself relating her attitude and story to the modern-day young soldier over here in The Stan.  I've seen young men over here whose lives are forever changed because of their position as a pawn on the game board that the rich war pigs in Washington put them on.  I see it here, and read about it in the book.  I'm a RED, WHITE, and BLUE Conservative...but this book hit home.  There's something really wrong with America where US Military men like myself and all these young men and women make didly squat $$$ while the rich keep getting richer and have all their appendages.  This book filled me with anger toward the war pigs.  I would've given this book a higher rating if there was more action and less teeny-bopperness.  So I give 4 stars to this book and a big middle-finger to the war pigs in D.C.
After speeding through Suzanne Collins' epic story of an extraordinary girl and her adventures,  I now understand the meaning of "immersed in the story." The Hunger Games is a fantastic page-turner and is a mix of crazed love and brutal action. When Katniss Everdeen is forced to leave her beloved family and home to participate in the annual Hunger Games, her bravery and strength surprise everyone. Her skills are put to the ultimate test while she fights against 23 competitors for her own life. When she decides to team up with her companion from home, she begins to realize that she not only wants to leave there alive, but her feelings toward him are beginning to change. Follow Katniss on her twisted journey to save her own life that leaves you wanting more through the last page. With a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter, you can't help but keep reading.  Collins is a spectacular writer that has an engaging way of keeping you hooked. This book has shown me how determination and skill can lead you to success. I would suggest this book to any thrill seeker over the age of 12. Boys, girls, or adults, this book will capture your attention throughout. Read this book; you won't be sorry!
This book was (in my opinion) exhilarating! Though it was sad in the end of the Games, Suzanne knows how to capture readers in her 'imagination'. I love the Hunger Games and finally read it this summer after my mother purchased it. I love to read and before I knew it, I had finished it in and hour and a half. My mom and my friends don't know how I read that fast-exept maybe Shannon. she's a fast reader like me and probably knows how I read fast (I think). Though I don't necessarily like Peeta..... I love Katniss though. I have always wanted to use the now and arrow... I have a bow and arrow at home, but the arrows are tipped with darts. I'm pretty good at that. my neighbor thinks she's SOOOOOO good at the bow. she's always like "real pros can do this." she can be annoying A LOT. at least my best friend is better than her using the bow and she doesn't brag or say anything like; "real pros can do this or that" or "hahaha, my arrow went farther than yours!" and the second statement is what my neighbor like, ALWAYS says to my brother and I. I'm sorry if I got off track.................  Back to the topic..........  I'd greatly recommend this book.if you like survival, and death.
Ok, so I picked this one up to see what all the to-do was about, and also because I wanted to read it before the movie came out.  I had a co-worker who doesn't normally read these things recommend it to me, which was a good sign in my opinion.  Also, my wife, who is a school teacher, had heard a number of good things as well.  So I finally gave in and read it - and I was very surprised!  This book was much more brutal than I was expecting!  My fiction tastes usually fall in the realm of fantasy/sci-fi, and this fit right in.  The bleak future outlook and action fit right into my wheelhouse, and the plot was tense throughout.  The brief moments of humor or tenderness serve as a brief respite from what is to come in the book.  I had to keep reading as fast as I could because I had to see what was going to happen to these characters.  Memories of Battle Royale (the movie) and The Running Man (also the movie version) kept running through my head.  I kept thinking, "I can't believe they've made this theme into a novel suitable for young adults!"  But it works!  Katniss is a great character, and as tough as they come.  What a great (and strong) heroine.  I can't wait to read the next one!
As an Irish dance teacher, the hardest part of any class is getting the students to get up and start. They arrive to class with their Kindles, Nooks, PSPs and books firmly in hand, and I have to launch into my "crazy happy teacher" routine to bring them back to the room intellectually. That problem was significantly compounded when they started reading this book. Suzanne Collins' story so captivated them, I had to physically (gently) remove the items from their clutching hands.  Once I finally read The Hunger Games, I understood why. Not since Hatchet: 20th Anniversary Edition and many other of Gary Paulson's books and the Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7) books of JK Rowling, have stories and scenes stayed with me in my thoughts and dreams. The vividly drawn characters, the tight pacing and the entirely believable society and scenarios weave a world that appeals to adults and young adults alike.  This book may be classified as young adult, but as is true for all incredible books in this genre, it is equally pleasing to adults as well. I look forward to revisiting this again and again. Thank you, Suzanne Collins!!
This is definitely one of my favorite books, it does have a great plot and a lot of surprises that'll keep you wanting more... The characters are very well described and you get really attached to them. It does have a lot of romantic parts between Peeta and Katniss which I actually did enjoy. It is also nice because it talks about an authoritarian society with a dictator (President Snow, I believe is what his name is). There was a revolution awhile back and the government WON (how's that for a change), so now every year the government randomly selects 2 citizens (male/female) from each of the 12 districts. They each have to compete TO THE DEATH in the Hunger Games. It is televised all of the country and the government advertises it as an exciting event where people get to serve their government, when in reality it is just the government's way of showing that they are the ones who have the power and control over the people. If nothing good is happening in the games, the government take it upon itself to light some things on fire and kill of some of the competitors itself to get things going.  Alright, enough rambling about the story now, go read it yourself-You wont regret it!
My niece kept bugging me to read these books. I thought, okay I will reserve a copy at my local library. After putting the book on hold I saw I was number 1,332 on the waiting list! Whoa. So I decided to fork over the money and buy the set of three books on Amazon.  I'm glad I did.  The books are great. I really am impressed and not due to the hype surrounding the movie and book series. The books are really well written. Suzanne Collins really expresses the mood of the characters in her writing. You feel the gloom and anxiety in "The Hunger Games" as if you are there. You just feel the mood of the books. Not many writers can do this. Hemingway is perhaps the master of this in his writing style, and these books are near perfect in expressing what the characters are feeling with very concise style.You simply feel the emotion of the books. It's hard to explain. Only the best writers can pull this off.  The pacing of the first book is just great. The story just flows. I never felt like putting the book down, in fact I finished it in a couple of days. I can see why the book has caught fire and will be devoured by hordes of readers. It is that good.
I looooooove this book! Susan Collins is such an amazing author. I would suggest reading this BEFORE the you see the movies, because if you don't you'll be judged by the whole fandom.
I was at work one day when my co-worker started talking about this trilogy she just finished and how I should definitely read it. I took her word thinking it sounds like an interesting enough story worth reading. What I didn't expect is to get so wrapped up in the characters and the story itself. I literally could not put it down. Any downtime I had was spent reading just to see what happens next. It has the love triangle of the ever so mesmerizing Twilight Saga along with the essence of the book 1984; Love, "Big Brother", rebellion, battle scenes without too much gore. The characters are so well written you can't help but fall in love with them. When I finished the first book I simply HAD to read the second. With each chapter Suzanne Collins leaves you hanging at the end, and you can't help but turn the page, dying to know what the next chapter has in-store for Katniss. It's brilliantly written, with just enough humor, emotion, desire, love and any other human emotion can be found in this book. It's one of those books you wish you could tell everyone you know about so they too can experience such a wonderful and inspiring journey, hence why I am writing this review. :)
My 11 year old daughter had been pestering me for months to read Hunger Games. Since most of her books are young adult magical fantasies I resisted. When I finally picked it up I couldn't put it down.  The marks of a good book in my mind are: does it make you think? Do the characters seem like real people? Would you read it again? Can you put it down to eat? The Hunger Games struck me hard on all of these points.  Katniss seems like a real heroine. She is a survivor, she's had to be. This has left her scarred and somewhat withdrawn emotionally. She doesn't really trust anyone but her sister Prim and her hunting partner Gale. At 16 she is still completely oblivious to romance but is sure that she will never get married nor have children that may be forced to participate in the games. Her education is lacking, which explains much of the grammar as the book is written completely in first person from her point of view. This book is as much a coming out story for Katniss as anything else.  I read all three at one go and I have a desire for more that won't be satisfied. Read Hunger Games, as unless you are unusual in your tastes you will love it, and I am 47.
I like to call myself a "sensitive viewer".  I literally will have physical reactions to heavy violence, torture, etc.  For instance I almost lost my lunch a few times while watching Black Swan recently (and people are calling it a dark comedy!!).  So after reading the synopsis I was shocked that this is YA and EW is calling it the next "Twilight".  But specifically due to the fact that it is YA is the reason I thought, "Well it can't be THAT violent."  And it's not too bad.  In fact, it's really good.  There are some parts that are brutal and it's not a perfect book i.e. the author shows a bit of laziness with gifts magically parachuting out of the sky at dire moments and Katniss constantly aware of the cameras and the audience but she never once sees a camera?  That bothered me.  It also raised some questions which may be answered in the next books, e.g. Why do the Districts continue having children at all and how could a parent ever let his/her child be dragged away like that?  However I can't NOT give 5 stars to a book I bought on Monday and was late for work on Thursday morning because I HAD to finish it.  I will be reading the next two very soon.
I enjoyed The Hunger Games from beginning to end. There were a million different ways that this book could have gone, and I was never sure which path would be chosen. Collins's writing was gripping and her characters complex; the main character, Katniss, does some things that could not be looked at a honorable, but could anyone say they would not act in such a way if they were put in her situation?  The Hunger Games explores violence and its effects on people's lives. Throughout the book I was in shock that a country would allow such cruel things as those that happen to  Panem's citizens to occur. Once I sat back and thought it over some, I realized that maybe these events were not as far fetched as one would hope.  This book set me thinking, and I was very impressed up until the last page when I saw that the book's ending was a cliffhanger. This struck me as an obnoxious way to end it since it basically forces everyone to read the next book to get any resolution. However, as long as the reader is prepared to read the sequel, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a thought provoking, action packed book where the tension never runs out.
I feel a little deflated after reading The Hunger Games.  Perhaps it was all the reviews gushing about this being the best book they've ever read, or thought provoking, or emotionally engaging that built this up to a point it couldn't possibly live up to.  Or the opposite reviews going on and on about the brutality and graphic violence.  Again, I don't quite get it.  Perhaps the only books these others read are fairy tales with happy endings because I didn't find it even close to the most violent, brutal, or graphic book I've ever read.  Certainly nothing most people, the YA audience included, haven't already read or seen on television or in movies or video games.  Don't get me wrong, it was okay.  It wasn't a bad read.  But it's certainly not the most engaging book I've ever read.  I had trouble relating to the main character so I never really felt like I was engaged in the story.  I found Peeta and Rue much more relatable.  I liked it enough that I will probably read the sequels, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.  Maybe I would have given it more than 3 stars if I hadn't read all the glowing reviews first - but I did and frankly, I expected more.
Sometimes a book is unavoidable.  First, my Grandson was in need of a credit in HS and was given the option of reading the trilogy and then doing a separate project for each one. He highly recommended the books to me, then the movie hype, so I figured I may as well read the book.  Suzanne Collins, who has had some success as a writer for children's television has created an interesting dystopian society where the country is broken into 12 Districts of various resources, but all poor and citizens struggle to feed their families.  Each year, the Capital, where wealth and luxury abound, holds a drawing from all of the 12 to 18 year-olds, selecting one boy and one girl from each District, to compete, to the death, in the Hunger Games.  That's a rather simplified description of a somewhat complex process.  The winner receives recognition for their District and a much more comfortable life for themselves and their family.  The author does a nice job of fleshing out characters, imbuing both the main and secondary ones with enough attributes and personality to make them interesting in their own right.  I chose to give the book four stars.  It's not one of the best I've ever read, and in its category as a YA novel(which would include all the Harry Potter works) it's not quite to that level. However, I liked it well enough and any book that gets children reading deserves serious props. The Hunger Games
The book was both exciting and disturbing. Right now we watch reality TV shows from the safety of our living rooms. In these programs nobody's really hurt. In this book it's a different story. The author takes it to a whole new level where the state sponsored bloodsport is for real.  State sponsored bloodsport is not a new concept. In ancient Mayan civilization there was a state sponsored game called pitz, where the loosing team was sacrificed. Similarly in ancient Rome the gladiators participated in bloodsport cheered on by thousands of spectators.  Even more recently in our own history in July 1861, during the Civil War, residents of Washington, D.C. picnicked at Bull Run stream at Manassas, Virginia and watched the bloody battle.  What is it about our lives that makes us like bloodsport? The average person lives for about 28,000 days 672,000 hours. In that time there's lots of mindless routine, downtime and boredom. Books like this help us to relieve that boredom.  If you think The Hunger Games is exciting try reading Writer Interruptus.  Writer Interruptus and Other Stories
So I'm late with the whole Hunger Games obsession, I realize that, but I have to agree with the majority of people out there and say this is one fun book. It was a highly addictive read that had me turning pages at full speed.  Katniss is a great protagonist. She's someone I really felt at ease with, someone I understood, which is one of the huge issues I usually have with YA books: I pretty much always dislike the female protagonist. But Katniss is a force of nature, with cunning and strength that makes her one of my favorites of the genre. Peeta is also fun, although he can get a little frustrating, and Haymitch, since he resembles Katniss in personality so much, is another that loved.  But of course, the plot here is king. The whole idea of the book, although not wholly original (Stephen King's The Long Walk is a predecessor with an even more compelling cast of characters), is clever enough to keep us all guessing and wanting more. Some things, like the muttations at the very end, felt a bit contrived and the book would have been better without it, but on the whole, this is a fascinating book.  Now I'm off to start the second one!
I received this book as a Christmas present. I had never even heard of the book, but noticed that there is a movie coming out this year. I started reading it that evening before bed and told myself that I'd stop at the first good stopping place. Six hours later I finally found the last page of the book and decided that was the best stopping point I could find.  This book was intriguing. I can see why this was picked up as a movie. The story line is engaging and moves quickly. There is a lot of drama and action. Katniss is a 16 year old who grows up in a world where children are forced to participate in a fight-to-the-death "game" that occurs every year. When her younger sister's name is pulled as a participant this year, Katniss volunteers to take her place. I was drawn to her character. Author Suzanne Collins has crafted an intriguing story that moves quickly and keeps people wondering how this story will turn out. One word of caution, the depictions of the battle scenes are descriptive, so I would certainly think a PG-13 rating would apply to this book.

Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark are living out their worst nightmares.  In post-apocalyptic North America The Capitol forces each of the 12 districts remaining to send 2 teenagers, 1 boy and 1 girl, every year to the Capitol to take part in a fight to the death, last man standing is the winner "game".  The brilliance of this book lies in the progression of Peeta and Katniss's relationship with each other and what they are or are not willing to do in the name of survival.  Don't expect another "Brave New World" clone - you won't find it here.  Ms. Collins uses the backdrop of tyranny and oppression to tell one girl's story.  That Katniss has an inherent rebellious streak is evident from nearly the first page - but it's rebellion to keep her family from starving, and eventually to try to ensure her own survival in the Games.  The author takes us through quite a journey of surprises, unrequited love and the cunning of a young girl determined to go back to her family.  This is an excellent and unexpectedly well-written offering.  This is a book clearly written with teens in mind, but it's just as appealing for adults.
Some people are picky eaters, but I am a picky reader. Within minutes of reading The Hunger Games, I was addicted to the book. The heart-pounding plot is filled with action that will make your adrenaline start to flow. The book is predictable, but you could never imagine what obstacles the characters have to endure to make the book happen the way it does.  Survival of the fittest is the way the game goes. In The Hunger Games, the world is split into twelve districts. Each year, one girl and one boy from each district, are chosen at random to compete to the death in The Hunger Games.  Some people view being chosen as a gift, while others think of it as the worst thing possible. Katniss is the girl from district twelve. During The Hunger Games, you will experience Katniss' journey from beginning to end, through the simple and difficult challenges that are thrown at her.  The Hunger Games is an extraordinary book. It is great for young adults, male and/or female. If you are a type of person that will stay up all night, reading a book to find out what happens next, then The Hunger Games is a good book for you.

Months ago, I began researching books to give as birthday gifts to my son who would be turning eleven. He is very serious, loves social studies, and wants to be a historian.  However, the catch was that I needed a book written for young teens that contained a compelling-enough story line to tear my smart son away from his Xbox.  Well, The Hunger Games turned out to be the perfect choice.  I knew I found something special the morning when my son, who hadn't touched a book since receiving the Xbox for Christmas and never seemed interested in fiction anyway, called me at work before 9 a.m. and said, "Mom, guess what?  I've already read 2 chapters of 'Hunger Games' this morning and I don't want to put it down!!"  This is a gateway book that has turned my son on to reading in general and opened his eyes to the vast and dynamic world of imagination, vision, and politics through fiction.  Sure the book doesn't have buttons, controllers, or satisfyingly responsive sound effects, but it lights up the world of the mind.  Others may have had their Harry Potter.  This is a beautifully written thriller for a new generation!
This is one of the few times that I saw the movie before reading the book... I prefer to read the book first but didn't have time. Well, this worked well for me, because although the movie was good, the book absolutely blew me away; I think I'd have been disappointed in the movie if I'd read the book first.  For those who have seen the movie only, the book is actually much darker. Darker than a bunch of kids being forced to kill each other, you ask? How is that possible? It's the strength of Suzanne Collins' writing that does it. She makes Katniss a flawed and not-always-likeable character... which made me like her even more. There's one HUGE change from the book to the movie... right at the end of the Games... where we see just how determined Katniss is to survive, at any cost.  Katniss is an amazing character: strong, protective of her family, totally kick-ass, yet very believable. To me she's one of THE stand-out heroines of all time.  I won't repeat all the other things people have already said about this book, so let me just echo that it DOES add up to all the hype. Just read it!
This book (and the whole of the series) is undoubtedly my absolute favorite. It is wonderful, suspensful, and so many other words that I can't describe it.  Suzanne Collins has done a excellent job of showing you how cruel people in life can be, what lengths people will go to for power, and the courage of the few people who actually try to stop it.  "The Hunger Games" is basically about a girl, Katniss Everdeen, and her love, her devotion, her perserverance, and her survival. The way she protects her family, the way she stands for wat she believes, how she can withstand all the pain and torture in her life, it's all so beautifully described, so clearly explained, that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action.  Suzanne Collins did and absolutely amazing job with this book, as with all her others. I highly recommend this to anyone, no matter the age.  However, the movie of this book is coming out March 23, 2012, and it's rated PG13 for violence. I suggest that if you're under 12, you shouldn't watch it unless you can stand to watch people being torn apart and blown up, to name a few.
A very good - no, excellent book... that was almost impossible to put down. I started this book with low-expectations, and ended up enjoying this waayy more than I ever imagined! It had me on the edge of my seat almost every step of the way - anxious to find out what's to come next, who would survive, and how they would accomplish the tremendous feats set before them. Very involving! It is most definitely a story of a battle, but a powerful one &amp; thought provoking one! Yes, there is killing &amp; starvation... pain &amp; extreme suffering - and at the hands of children. But it's also a story of survival &amp; strength. It's real &amp; raw... even intense at times... but well worth it all!  Now to get my hands on book two... while I wait for the movie premiere, next week - and hope that doesn't pale in comparison to the captivating excellence of the book!! :)  ** Note: While I enjoyed this book, immensely.. I would not recommend it for kids under 15, unless they're extremely mature(emotionally) &amp; well grounded - and the parent(s) of the child is/are willing to necessitate lots of discussion along the way!!
When his book first started growing in popularity I  couldn't understand why. I personally don't like violence and the thought  of reading about children having to murder each other repulsed me.  Now the reason I read the book is because my brother had me watch the movie. Their most certainly were parts of the movie I didn't watch but I found the plotline very interesting and how the author was trying to show what can happen when people must live in fear.  I am an advanced reader so I found this book to be a very quick read. It is written in first person as Katness Everdeen. The plot is excellent and the main reason I like the book is that the author didn't feel obligated to describe the horrible ways the opponents died in the arena. I like the fact that she knew that such descriptions were not needed. Their is constant character development in the book and it just doesn't center around Katness or Peeta. While they are the two main characters the others are not ignored.  Personally I would recommend the book over the movie. The book carries a stronger emotion and gives greater character insite.
This book requires open-mindness and imagination. A book about revolution, strength, and survival of the fittest. Katniss Everdeen, the main character, volunteers herself to take her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games. A game designed for twenty four players to play and only one will win the game. In order for there to be one winner, the players will have to use their survival instincts, wits, pain endurance and strengths to kill others to be the surviving winner. This game was created by the Government to discourage its citezins to revolt against it. However, Katniss did not expect to find allies and an ally who is a love interest who she may eventually have to kill or be killed by. Through out the book,citezins watching the Hunger Games are encouraged by Katness not to continue to be subjected to the cruelties that the goverment inflicts upon them. With this being said, I could not put this book down.At the same time it took me on an emotional rollercoater of feelings ranging from nervousness, anger, and sadness. How this author thought of such plot,amazes me. This is a great book for all ages.
It took my 2 days to read this book and in that time ive put it down once (it was 3:30 am and I got up at 7 am that day so i was very tired). I think just that says a lot about the book.  Ive read other people's reviews and I have to say yes - children (&lt;18)should probably not read this book (its violent and bloody) and no - this is not a ripoff form "battle royale". Why? If you actually read more then 1 book once a year you should know that ideas in fiction books tend to come back once in a while. I mean come on thousands of books are written every yeah since forever. If you expect every idea to be 100% different from one another i have bad news. Look at a lot of crime books. See what I did there?  Now what i liked about the book. I liked the 3rd person narration, the whole idea of the world, the history behind organizing hunger games. The book might lack a bit of descriptions but that leaves space for your imagination so thats not that bad actually. I liked that the main character doesnt change when she enters the competition.  I apologize for any language mistates I made but english is not my native.
Suzanne Collins creates a world that is unique and separate, yet intimately familiar to our own in Hunger Games. A young woman whose father has died and her mother debilitated by depression Katniss has had to take care of her mother and baby sister growing up way to quickly in a world where the young don't stay young for long. Devoted completely to her family and with a deep love for her sister; she sacrifices her own life for that of her sister Primrose in the Hunger Games a reality show that means instant death.  The Hunger Games is a reality show for those in the privileged first district, taking children from the other twelve districts and making them fight to the death. The children from District 13, where Katniss is, generally die as this is a poor district that can not prepare or support their children in this fight. Katniss willingly enters the Hunger Games to save her sister. What follows is an incredible story of fear, hope, loss, and war. It will hold your attention completely and if you take my advice you'll buy the trilogy at once because you're going to want to read all three at once.
This is set in an era where the country is divided into districts and each year a girl and boy is selected 2 from each district to compete in a game of survival pitted against each other until only one winner remains that's 24 contestants.  From district 12 there is Katniss Everdeen a girl who lives in the seam, hunts in the woods trades in the Hob. She's going into the death game.  Before the game of death all she new was survival and hunger. This a good page turner for all ages well written, you ...more This is set in an era where the country is divided into districts and each year a girl and boy is selected 2 from each district to compete in a game of survival pitted against each other until only one winner remains that's 24 contestants.

Honestly, I'm not even going to go into detail about the book. I heard about the movie and I knew it was pretty popular but I never really cared. I went into a Barnes and Noble one day to get something for school. When they didn't have the item I needed I ended up wandering around just looking. Honestly, I'm not even a huge fan of books or reading. I don't know why but I spontaneously chose to purchase this book after crossing the big stand/display they had for it; perhaps I just did not want to go home empty handed. After I got home, I put the book on my drawer and left it there, in the bag, for weeks. Just three days ago I decided to pick the book up and, since I am not a huge fan of reading, my reading pace was quite slow. In nearly every free minute I have had (on the train, on the bus, before sleep, before leaving for school, in between class) I have turned to this book to fulfill an addiction. I've just finished reading it less than 20 minutes ago and decided to do this review, as my first review on this website, simply because of the awe I was put in by this book. Just buy it, trust me.
After seeing the movie first then reading the book I got a pretty good comparison, here's what I liked from both.  The Book: I felt the desperation more while reading the book, I liked the voucher and how you can get your name entered more than once if you sign up for voucher's each month, I thought that should have been in the movie.  The mutations turned out to be a pretty big reveal, but were nay slightly mentioned in the movie. I also liked that that they kissed more than once in the book.  The Movie: It nailed the casting, of each and every character.  I liked the beginning in the book a lot more than the movie.  I did love how they let the gamemaster be a character, that  really worked well, in the book he mentioned a couple of times.  The ending the movie really got right they cut out the fluff and kept the story moving, The book shows Cato being scared, I liked him in the movie more being an emotionless robot.  I enjoyed both the book and the movie, bot and would recommend reading and watching both, there's enough differences that makes each enjoyable.
So, I made the mistake of reading some of the negative reviews before reading this book, so I was glad to read the book and think, "What were those people talking about?" This is not typically the kind of book I would read. I like things to be lighthearted with a guaranteed happy ending. I found this book to be heart wrenching, exciting, well told, cliffhanging, heart stopping, and life changing. I can't help it. I only decided to read it because a few of my friends had been talking about it and every time I visited the Kindle book store it was sitting there begging me to buy it. I decided that I should give it a chance and that made all of the difference. I am so glad I read this. Once I started reading the book it was too late to stop anyway, so here I am beginning Mocking Jay, staying up late hours and obsessing over the outcome of Panem. I tend to be one of those who reads the big epic pop culture book series like "Harry Potter" and "Twilight", but never has there been a time that I liked a character so much as Katniss Everdeen. She is strong, she does what she has to do, but is still vulnerable. I read a review from someone who said she was the worst character ever who was completely unlikable and had no redeeming qualities. After reading the book I realized that the person who wrote that review was so very wrong. Katniss is amazing and you'd be hard pressed to find a character as fascinating and kick butt. Peeta is another of my favorite characters, EVER! He is selfless, kind and strong. I can't explain the way my heart breaks during certain scenes in this book. I have to admit that I am not nearly as connected to Gale as to Peeta. I guess if there is the old stupid "Twighlight Teams thing" going on that I'd be all the way Team Peeta, lol. Some parts to the book are pretty brutal, but not too much to handle. I thought I was going to have a problem with some of it, but it just added to the suspense of the novel. All in all, this book is not just worth a read, its a book that will make you think, a book that will make you route, a book that will make your heart break a little. I loved it!
The Hunger Games is a 2008 young-adult science fiction novel by Suzanne Collins, and the first in a trilogy. In a post-apocalyptic dystopian totalitarian state, children are selected to fight to the death on live television.  This is hardly an original idea; it's most strongly reminiscent of Koushun Takami's Battle Royale and, to a lesser extent, Stephen King's The Long Walk and The Running Man (the movie more so than the novella). Yet Collins manages to keep the setting and the games themselves reasonably fresh. And, after something of a slow start, the book becomes an entertaining, page-turning affair.  Like far too many recent young-adult novels, The Hunger Games is written in the first-person present tense. I don't know if this is an attempt to engage teens perceived to have short attention spans or what, but it's obnoxious, and it provides no benefit over conventional past tense (one eventually gets used to it, fortunately).  Aside from this, Collins' writing is solid (although the copy editing on this book is rather poor - not her fault). Katniss is a satisfactorily sympathetic character: she's impulsive but self-sacrificing, and clever, resourceful, and self-sufficient without being deal-breakingly sassy or annoying. The book has a couple of convenient plot coincidences, but nothing unforgivable.  As young-adult books go, The Hunger Games might be as dark and violent as they come. And the novel stumbles here because it doesn't seem to have much to say about its subject matter (beyond "the government making kids kill each other is bad"). The protagonist is forced to kill other children to survive (most of them, like her, are in this situation through no fault of their own) - you would think that this scenario would lend itself to some psychological self-exploration, but Collins punts on this issue, as Katniss, with only superficial reflection, is implausibly businesslike on the subject - she never thinks much about the people she's killed, even during her many quiet times. This suggests a disturbing degree of amorality. It's as though all these kids get dumped into the arena already in full-on Lord of the Flies mode. Collins herself seems much more interested in 1984-style criticism of totalitarian government, which is the subject she's set herself up to address in the sequel. All of this may put off certain readers, and not unreasonably. In short, Collins' treatment of moral issues is a legitimate concern, and a missed opportunity - her scenario, unlike, say, The Running Man, doesn't lend itself well to action movie-style morality.  On the whole, The Hunger Games, while hardly a perfect book, is suspenseful and entertaining, which always overcomes a lot of flaws. It's recommended to readers who like this sort of thing - if you can acknowledge the moral issues.
Honestly, I only started this book because of all the hype and the fact that it is being made into a movie. I have never joined into a series while it was still big, even with Twilight I didn't start reading it until the fourth book was released, I just never saw the point. I am glad that I picked up The Hunger Games before the movie adaptation's release next year, before all the deaths and surprises were ruined. Although I didn't love the book, like so many others, and found much of the writing rather pedestrian, I did enjoy it enough to read the next in the series.  What I Enjoyed:  - The overall concept is cool and full of possibilities. The idea of a post-apocalyptic world ruled by faceless overlords who remind you of their authority in terrifying and often deadly ways is a fun idea. Sure, it felt a little reminiscent of several other sci-fi tropes, I kept expecting a rogue Gorn to appear in the middle of the arena, but it was still interesting. I am interested to see how the Capitol reacts in the next book, see if their wrath of God mentality can be scary enough to really challenge the characters.  - I like that Collins wasn't afraid to put children in harm's way, to kill them to show the loss of innocence, it reminded me a lot of Lord of the Flies. She also didn't feel the need to pull any punches in the deaths, often mutilating her victims in nightmarish ways, making me wonder how well she would do with an adult horror series.  - The characters were okay, some better developed than others and some obviously more sympathetic than others. I think Rue and Cinna were my favorites, they were mysterious enough that I was intrigued but they were also loveable and slightly strange. I would have liked to see more of Gale, he was more interesting than Peeta, and sorry to say but I didn't care too much for the main protagonist Katniss. I also would have liked to read more about the other tributes, what were their stories? Were they really as terrible as Katniss thought?  - I enjoyed the surprises, most of them I didn't see coming, although being that the end result was that the majority of the contestants had to die kind of took all the suspense out of the story. But Collins did a good job of finding ways to pump of the heart racing bits by giving us some interesting deaths and unforeseen threats, the big twist/threat at the Cornucopia was a brilliant turn. Again she should try her hand at adult horror or sci-fi. But the other big twist was too easy and obvious, too wishy washy, and a bit of a cop out.  Now onto why I liked but didn't love the book.  - It feels like Collins had one idea for her lead, and then didn't like it and changed her mid-book, making Katniss seem confused and not that intelligent. She is a smart character, resourceful and somewhat sympathetic, although at times it feels forced, but she is far too thick when it comes to Peeta and Gale. Sometimes I am rooting for her, other times I can't wait to see what tortures are coming her way because she seems so dense.  - Collins' writing style, especially the first person progressive narrative, drives me up the wall! I don't think you can fully tell a story that is engaging when you write in that style, where everything is happening to the protagonist as she is describing it, something is just missing. Speak of describing it, Collins seems to be the "don't show, tell" kind of author, not allowing the audience to read what happens but instead sums it up in brief and bland descriptions. I would have liked to get more detail, more anything, it just felt like something was missing half of the time. Also, she writes in an annoyingly choppy style, which probably comes from it being straight from the character's head, but still it was taxing.  Overall this was a fun ride, I was excited to read the next chapter, enthralled by the concept if let down by the execution and main character. I cannot wait to see the movie, the cast, at least for the minor characters, seems spot on and the changes are what I am really looking forward to.  Grade: B-
Post-apocalyptic stories never get old. And when they're as good and gripping and moving as THE HUNGER GAMES, well, no other sci-fi conceit gets even close (okay, maybe time travel). Anyway, THE HUNGER GAMES is the first in Susanne Collins's proposed YA trilogy. After reading this one, I'm saying: Why stop at a trilogy?  In the wake of a holocaust which reshaped the world and made North America extinct, the Panem nation rose from the ashes and became the de facto power. Panem consists of the ruling Capitol, surrounded by the outlying twelve districts. Many, many years ago, there were actually thirteen districts, all of which rebelled but then were put down, with the thirteenth district being mercilessly annihilated. Ever since then, as punishment and a constant reminder to not eff with the Capitol, each of the remaining twelve districts holds annual lotteries to send a girl and a boy, between the ages of 12 and 18, to the Capitol to compete in the Hunger Games, a broadcasted event in which the children, now called tributes, are placed in a vast, bleak arena and forced to fight each other to the death, until only one is left.  This book tells the story of one contestant - 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who comes from the destitute and backwards 12th District - and how she fares in the Hunger Games. You will not, will not, will not forget her soon.  Katniss doesn't believe she has what it takes to survive the deadly competition. Yes, she's a hunter and thick into woodscraft, but she realizes that the emissaries from the other, wealthier districts are bigger, stronger, and more vicious. It's partly this underdog element which hooked me but quick. Katniss is one of the best protagonists I've ever come across in fiction, male or female, and a character which will resonate deeply with you. Katniss certainly has her flaws, but she's written so sympathetically that, within the first few pages, I knew I'd caught on to what possibly could be one of my all-time favorite reading experiences. I've read a lot of stuff in my time, and, yes, THE HUNGER GAMES is that good!  I honestly haven't heard of Suzanne Collins before, but she's for dang sure a storyteller. There's a whiff of THE RUNNING MAN and THE LONG WALK (both by Stephen King, The Bachman Books : Four Early Novels by Richard Bachman (Rage / The Long Walk / Roadwork / The Running Man)), but THE HUNGER GAMES is very much its own intense entity. Yes, it's a blend of reality television and gladiator films, two things the author cites as inspiration for this book, along with the myth of the Minotaur. Regarding the reality TV angle, I was particularly fixated with Katniss's strategy in the arena, which heavily relies on her playing up to the audience, in part because gaining sponsorship could mean possible life-saving gifts (food, medicine, whatever) parachuting from the sky. The book provides edge-of-your-seat suspense, what with there being enough violent encounters and desperate bids for survival to sate any action fan. Not only are there the fellow contenders to deal with, but the landscape hides enhanced killer wasps, mutated "werewolves," and whatever else the Gamemakers can contrive to make the bloodthirsty contest even more "audience-friendly." And the rules can change in a moment, and then changed again.  Certainly, there's no shortage of highlight moments to keep you feverishly turning pages (Katniss's memorable fiery entrance during the opening ceremonies; what Katniss does to earn her training score; what happens when Katniss is caught up in a tree; etc.). There are two particularly powerful and poignant moments - one early on, the other just a bit past halfway thru the book - which will reduce you to a messed-up, choked-up state. Guaranteed.  To me, THE HUNGER GAMES is a love story, even more so than it is an adventure thriller. And I'm not referring to the romantic triangle which crops up (honestly, to me, that was the least interesting story arc). The most touching part of the book is Katniss's relationship with her younger sister, Prim, and how she's so very fiercely protective of her. Katniss's affection for Prim would later be extended by proxy to one of the younger, more vulnerable tributes. What also gets me emotionally is how the struggling coal mining community of the 12th District says goodbye to Katniss and, later, how the 11th District pays her back for a kindness done.  Lest we forget, Panem is an oppresive entity and will brook no resistance. Katniss manages to demonstrate a rebellious streak against the Panem government, but since her mutinous acts aren't that overt, she gets away with them. But I get the feeling that, as the sequels go on, Katniss Everdeen will play a key part in upending this unjust dystopian culture. THE HUNGER GAMES closes with many things unresolved, all the more reason, no doubt, for readers to pick up the sequel. Me, I am so very curious and excited to see how this whole thing plays out... And I'll say it again: why stop at a trilogy?
THE HUNGER GAMES, a tale of survival that pits 24 teenagers against each other in a fight to the finish, will strike readers as both unique and familiar.  Its premise features twelve defeated districts surrounding a ruling American empire called Panem, with each district required to give over a male and a female between ages 12 and 18 for a fight-to-the-death reality game against each other.  Here we have echoes of Shirley Jackson's famous short story, "The Lottery," in which an unlucky person is selected for death each year in the name of tradition, AND of the television show SURVIVOR, wherein a large party of competitors must be whittled down to one.  The plot is also reminiscent of JK Rowling's GOBLET OF FIRE and the famous showdown between students from competing houses at Hogwarts.  Whether readers are familiar with similar scenarios or not, there's no denying that Suzanne Collins' YA novel is riveting, with a plot that can't help but grip readers from adults to teens to even pre-teens (violence is the only precaution for younger readers).  The protagonist, 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, hails from one of the poorest districts, #12, where coal mining is the struggling economy's mainstay.  Her father taught her how to hunt with a bow and arrow before his death in a mine explosion, and Katniss is left to support her little sister Prim and her mother by bringing home game or exchanging it on the black market for bread and other staples.  When the lottery sees her innocent younger sister Prim chosen, Katness volunteers to take her place, and the arc of the plot begins its long trajectory to an unlikely end.  More than just a survival adventure, THE HUNGER GAMES also features a sub-plot of romance.  In the early chapters, we have Gale, an 18-year-old hunter who takes Katniss under his wing and shares his hunting know-how and companionship.  Then, once the Hunger Games start, there's Peeta, the baker's son and male representative of District #12 who accompanies Katniss to the games.  He has a problem that quickly becomes hers as well: he has nursed a secret crush on Katniss since his youth, yet the games dictate that you must kill ALL your competitors -- even the other person from your district -- to be declared the winner.  Playing with issues of morality and war, good and evil, love and hatred, Collins keeps the reader engaged by describing the games' elaborate preparations, many of the fight scenes, and some of the more interesting competitors from other districts.  Some of them from the richer districts, called "Careers," have actually been groomed to fight and kill for these games.  These "Careers" even volunteer to go to the Hunger Games, and not because their little sisters were chosen, either.  Like modern-day mercenaries, they are killing machines, and a huge obstacle between either Katniss or Peeta living to hear the final horn.  Overall, this novel is a sure bet for young readers who love plot above all else.  Yes, it does seem a bit drawn out toward the end (just when the reader is hungriest for the climax) as Collins attends to her love sub-plot, but overall, this book deserves high marks.  Highly recommended.  (Note: This book finishes with the words "End of Book One," so apparently is the first of a planned series.)
Before reading The Hunger Games, I had heard tons of people rant and rave about this book. The Hunger Games does not disappoint. The book is fast paced and you won't be able to set it down.  Katniss is a great character who really doesn't want to kill anyone in the games, but she's a survivor. If it comes down between living or dying she's going to do what it takes to make sure she comes out on top. I really felt that she grew into her own as the Games progressed and she really discovered that she's the hunter, not the hunted.  Peeta is a really charming character that grew on me through out the book. He is really different from the other tributes in the books, he doesn't set out to harm anyone and doesn't want to kill anyone.  Once the Hunger Games began, you really got to see how twenty four kids fought for their survival and you can't help but feel helpless as the winner emerges and tributes die.  I highly recommend that you read this book that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat and questioning the world that these kids live in.
It seems like "The Hunger Games" craze is in full effect, and I have bought in. A couple have friends have told me that they cannot put this book down, so I bought it to see what it was all about. As soon as the first chapter Collins, the author, has you hooked into a fantasy world that is eerily feasible.  This new country on old American soil seems real enough to be happening in the near future. The United States is in ruins, and a new country has risen up to power. The government rules the people with an iron fist and to remind the people not to up rise they have an annual contest called the hunger games. This is when each state or district must send two teenagers to an arena and fight to the death.  What makes this book different from any other fantasy. I believe it is the characters. The protagonist is easily likeable yet flawed, and her two love interests are the same. Towards the end, the reader truly feels for their plight and will become emotionally involved in the story. This book is a must read, if only to be able to discuss it with the millions who are doing it also.
Because I definitely can't. This book had me captured from the beginning, and, once Katniss volunteered, I couldn't stop, I couldn't tear my eyes away (though, unfortunately, my mom made me go eat dinner). Well-developed characters, interesting plot line, excellent twists in the story. I don't understand how someone could NOT like this book. A brilliant woven story of romance intertwined with action and adventure. It felt right, and it was right, and left me craving for the second book. I've been waiting for seven months, and I don't know how I'm supposed to be waiting any longer. This book has crept up the list and has now claimed the spot of my favorite book of all time. Right now, the only book that has a chance of dominating is Catching Fire, which is the sequel to this book, and hasn't even come out yet.  For those who say that this book is too much like Battle Royale, I will say that it is like Battle Royale, but also completely different. And this story goes further with romance, and a possible rebellion in play in the next book. I cannot WAIT for the next book to come out.
I don't normally read fantasy/sci-fy - I'm not exactly sure where this story resides - but after not finnishing several 99 cent mystery/thrillers, figured I'd give it a whirl. I note several negative reviewers wrote from the perspective of the trilogy, and it's my experience that, like movie sequels, they get weaker as they progress, so I have no plans to read books 2 or 3.  That said I found this a good read. It was well written and I particularly felt the dialogue was quite realistically presented - not stiff, not clipped or terse - and provided some sense of the thought process of the speakers as the words came forth.  As fantasys go, you must choose to put yourself into the life style and environment of the characters and I was able to do this because of the detail furnished in the narrative. I bought into the heroine, from the beginning and thought her character was well developed, as were the other important participants.  Although the action lagged, at points in the middle, the  story line sustained interest as well as curiosity as to how things would finally play out.
When I first got this book as a gift for Christmas, I was skeptical about it.  Being a teen, reading isn't on the top of my list of "fun" things to do.  I opened the book up a few days later, and was hooked! In a way, Katniss Everdeen is so different from me, but I can easily relate to her also... weird right?  It took me three days to finish... I woke up, ate some breakfast, and didn't close the book until dinner.  I did this for three days and begged my mother to go out and get the next book in the trilogy.  At that time it was only in hardback, so I bought it on my nook instead, I am currently still reading the second book, which is also intriguing and brilliantly written.  Suzanne Collins has inspired my to become interested in reading and writing more.  Kudos to her for a GREAT book.  This-- in my opinion is for people age 12 and up.  My dad is currently reading the first book, and is really enjoying it.  I think that there is something for every type of reader in this book- Thrill, romance, suspense, and action- all packed into one amazing book.  I hope this helps!! :)
I borrowed The Hunger Games through the Amazon Prime lending program because it's received a lot of hype and plus there's a movie.  I had it on my Kindle for like two months before I finally sat down and read it.  I usually have a hard time liking books that have such a big reputation because my expectations are never met, but I LOVED THIS BOOK.  I read it in 24 hours, stayed up way too late because I couldn't put it down.  I don't want to get into too many details because it's such a great adventure to read and discover for yourself.  That being said, it is a little violent.  Most of the violence happens "off screen" outside of the direct experience of the main characters, but the premise is a fight to the death, so...  Anyway, the author does an amazing job narrating from the perspective of a teenage girl, Katniss.  Most of the story development is from her point of view.  I love the way Katniss develops through the story, seeing the world through teenage eyes, not knowing who to trust.  It's a completely believable unreal story, if that makes sense?
I started this book on the recommendation of a coworker and once I began to read, I just couldn't put it down.  I found myself keeping it on my desk just so I could sneak in reading a page or two while working.  The story is extremely well written.  You begin to feel for the characters.  I cried when bad things happened and was glad when things went well.  Its a futuristic end of the world as we know it kind of story.  The world as we know it is no longer the same.  Its been wiped out and 12 colonies are left.  The capital, as a way of oppressing the people, have developed the hunger games.  A boy and a girl are randomly selected from each colony to compete to the death in a controlled environment.  Its controlled only to the extent that would create the most exciting viewing.  To complicate things further, a blooming romance takes place in the books and capital lies and trickery continue to get worse.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a great read, a well written plot and a set of books that will keep you guessing as to what will happen next.
Before you start this book make sure you have nothing else to do. Once you open the first page, it is absolutely impossible to put down. I read it in 1 day! Amazing!
I thought this was a great book. I borrowed it from the lending library. After reading the other two books I will probably purchase this book so I can read it again
I don't know why I didn't want to read this series. For some reason, it just didn't appeal to me. I would hear incredible things from every single person that I talked to, but I just had this unexplained refusal to pick them up. I wish somebody would've made me read them though, because I am now hooked.  I don't even really need to write this review. What can I say that hasn't already been said a million times? The Hunger Games is enthralling and intense. The plot is sickening but incredibly entertaining at the same time. And Katniss is a kick-ass heroin who may put up a strong front, but probably has more weaknesses than anyone else in the series.  I love how well crafted everything is. I haven't read such a detailed and creative world since Hogwarts. The creatures, the people, the geography .. Suzanne Collins has a lot of imagination and she uses it well.  Overall, if you've been living under a rock and haven't heard of The Hunger Games, go pick it up now. Mixing action, suspense and romance, I definitely think this is one for girls and boys.
The Hunger Games is an amazing young adult novel that everyone seems to be reading so I had to check it out to see what all the hype was about. It's a really good book, but is very dark. It takes place in the future when the country is divided into 12 districts and once a year, they draw the name of one boy and one girl (age 12-18) from each district. These children have to fight to the death until there is only one winner. It's a way of keeping the people under control.  As far as my feelings about this book go, I'm torn. The story is compelling and I couldn't put it down, but it was really disturbing. I typically love dystopia novels, but I don't know exactly what it is about this one that makes it difficult to even clarify for myself what I think. I'm back and forth. On one hand, I couldn't wait to find out what would happen next and I definitely couldn't stop reading. On the other hand, I kept thinking it was incredibly dark and disturbing. The premise is so awful, it was hard to read. I wasn't even sure how to rate it, to be honest!
I am so happy I read this book because I really enjoyed it. I had resisted it because I don't read books in series. Technically, this is a trilogy, but still ...  (Yes, I will be reading the next two books as well.)  This actually is considered "young adult fiction" but I really enjoyed it because it's in one of my favorite genres: post-apocalyptic, non-zombie/non-vampire fiction. In addition to having a mesmerizing, action-filled story line, the book is written in a style that makes for a fast, easy read. The plot is such that I found myself thinking, more than once, "wow, this could actually happen." Of course hopefully it never will, because we would truly be living a horrifying existence if these events ever came to be.  I loved the main character in the book, and appreciated the voice the author gave her, which drew me into her mind and her world, and had me rooting for her from the beginning. It was pretty easy to figure out where the story was going to end up, but the fun of the book was in getting there.  Now, on to book #2 ...
I was certain that I wouldn't like this book before I started reading it.  Friends of mine had given me the basic idea of the plot, and I thought it would be terrible.  I saw how popular this trilogy had become and assumed it was just another Twilight.  I was wrong.  Although I wouldn't say that the series is as good as Harry Potter, I think it's a fair comparison.  I think the story is just as excellent; I think it's every bit as memorable.  I think the writing is better, but the characters just don't compare.  J. k. Rowling had a way with creating characters that I've never seen matched and that's where I think the Harry Potter series has the slight edge.  However, Katnis Everdeen has become one of my all time favorite characters from a book, so I'm not saying that the characters are bad.  The main problem that I had that kept me from really loving this series was that there are so many physically incomprehensible things that happen over the course of the story that I could not overlook.  Overall, though, my opinion is very favorable.
Nothing could tear this book out of my hands while I was reading it. The story is engaging and the writing is superb. It was my first experience reading something in a present first person tense and the result was impossible to put down. It reminds me a lot of Shirley Jackson's short story "The Lottery", but not in a way that I feel Collins ripped off someone else's idea; just expounded on it.  To me, the chracterization was Collins greatest strength.  Katniss was especially well written.  Her strengths and weaknesses combine to make a strong, but relatable person. Peeta is sometimes too good to be true, but it makes him all the more endearing.  Haymitch is a mean, dirty, hopeless drunk, but I love him for it.  The dystopian scenario she creates is so scary to me because I don't see us being that far off from something like this.  We already celebrate violence and bloodshed in movies and television. How long before our society gets bored with that and makes it real?  All in all, definitely worth reading.
Very engaging novel. My eyes have been glued to it for the last couple days. Very suspenseful, full of action, romance, great plot all around. The reading level is for teenagers but once you get past that it keeps you entertained. I had mixed feelings about the constant plot twists, especially near the ending. It seemed like she was trying to put 2 different plot twists into one chapter to answer all the" what if this happened?" you would ask yourself when your reading it. It almost seemed like she couldn't decide how to proceed the story. But in order to make a series she had to do it in this way i guess. Another thing i didn't like were the characters names. Some of them are ok and i understand this story is placed sometime in the future. Katniss i can get over, i just call her Kat. But Petta, Cinna, Haymitch, etc. come on thoses are all stupid and dull names. when the movie comes out im going to laugh because Katniss is going to call out PETTA! in the middle of the forest and its going to sound like louis griffin shouting PETER!
I (57 year old female) enjoyed the book. (I'm also a former teacher, meaning I think I know something about good writing...not much, just some.) The writing was concise, precise and not clichéd. The plot was interesting. This is a series reminiscent of Harry Potter. It's about kids of a certain age, and should certainly be interesting for kids of that certain age. Part of the draw of the Harry Potter series was how it was written appropriately for the ages of the kids IN the books, which was also the age of the kids READING the books. That trait also makes this particular series fun for ME, an older lady, as it allows me to put myself into the story as a youngster, instead of a sort-of oldster :-)  The Hunger Games series also seems (to me) well-written enough to be enjoyable to a wide range of ages.  Now, that said, my husband thought the book (including the story-line) was close to stupid. He was never a 16 year old girl. What does he know?  I'll borrow the rest of the series, though, from the public library.
On the advice of a fellow YA writer, I read The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. One word--awesome.  Katniss lives in a society that is divided into districts, each defined by the products it provides. She's from District 12--a poor, coal-mining area, and she's from the low end of that. She's forced to hunt illegally to feed her family, alongside her best friend, Gale. Her father has been killed in a coal-mine explosion, her mother is emotionally cut-off, and her little sister is the light of her life.  When her sister's name is chosen for participation in a brutal, fight-to-the-death competition between districts, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  The story is full of action, suspense, and deep emotion. I could not put this book down. I was completely caught up in Katniss's character, and I felt every moment of her experiences. Suzanne Collins' writing is masterful.  There is violence, of course, but it's not overboard. No sex, no cussing. But gobs and gobs of intensity.  Awesome. Really, really. A total must-read.
I just read the last page of the third book tonight and felt moved to write this.  There is no question that The Hunger Games is a fantastic and powerful series and that Suzanne Collins is brilliant.  The series is marketed as Young Adult Literature.  Just be aware: by no stretch of the imagination are these children's books.  They are fast paced and suspenseful, and tell of the best and worst of which humanity is capable.  The literary and historical references are plentiful.  But they are utterly gut wrenching in the description of Man's cruelty and inhumanity.  Fairytales are scary, but this is not a fairytale.  Without reservation, I highly recommend the series to adults.  I have just finished the series, and my highly literate 6th grader is already nearly finished the first book.  Now that she's already well into the series, I will let her continue, but probably warn her of some things coming up.  I find myself doing a lot of  hand holding and nightmare control.  It does elicit some deep discussions, though.  Just be aware.
The Hunger Games is definitely a must read. It is a science fiction/fantasy book for ages 11 and up. 4. The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic world where North America has been destroyed and is now Panem, which consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poor districts. In order to keep the poor districts from rebelling, every year, the Capitol randomly selects one boy and girl from each district to compete in a televised fight to the death called the Hunger Games. When Katniss Everdeen's younger sister Prim is selected to compete, Katniss volunteers to take her place. The story follows Katniss and the male "tribute" from her district, Peeta, as they struggle to survive the Hunger Games. 7. I really like The Hunger Games. It is a science fiction book that I enjoy because of the elaborate details, the crazy events, and the unique writing. Katniss is the epitome of a female protagonist. She is strong and capable, which makes her a great role model for teenage girls. I look forward to reading Catching Fire and Mockingjay.
I just got done reading this tonight, and I just bought it two days ago! I am also not a "young adult". I loved this book. If you want something you can read in short bursts, and put down to get something done, this isn't the book. I neglected school work, exercise, housework, even the internet because I could not put this book down! It's fast paced, and written in the present tense, which I think adds to its urgency. Someone said it was "too violent". I disagree. Any violence in this book is portrayed as something bad, something unavoidable because of the situation they have been put into. Can't wait to read the next one and see what happens next! Even though someone on here already posted their thoughts on the ending of the final book and have ruined things a bit for me...Just a heads up, it's the review stating this is too violent. If you want to review the other two books, DO IT ON THE APPROPRIATE PRODUCT PAGE.  Anyway, I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Harry Potter, The Gemma Doyle Trilogy, Twilight, etc.
This amazing book has gained a coveted spot on my top shelf of reading.  If i didnt like grouping my books together by story, then the Hunger Games would be in the number two postion right behind Twilight.  I had read alot of reviews on the book before i finally broke down and bought it, i wasnt even sure i would enjoy it, but man was i wrong.  The hunger games is a thrilling suspense ride that keeps you balancing on the edge of life and death with its main character Katniss.  This book is so enthralling, so inviting you feel like your right there next to all the character as they fight for there lifes and sometimes for eachothers. After i read this book i went to sleep knowing i was going to dream about the hunger games and sure enough i did, i actually woke up disorintated and checked my husbands pulse to make sure he was still alive. [he was....lol]  You cant easily forget the Hunger games once you'v read it  and the desire to know what happens next is about as strong as the desire to survive in the GAMES.
I can't rave about this book enough.  I don't want to summarize the book as Amazon has done so perfectly, but I had to gush over any book that I am able to enjoy as much as I enjoyed The Hunger Games. I couldn't put it down.  Katniss had my attention from the very first page.  I felt myself relating to her and sympathizing with her plight from the very beginning. And who didn't fall in love with Peeta?  He possessed such a warm heart and noble soul and somehow was able to not only hold on to both of these things but exudes them despite being right in the middle of hell.  The story is absolutely enthralling with its quick wit, fast pace, and captivating story line.  I'm amazed at Suzanne Collins's ability to mix humor, terror and romance all within the same volume.  Somehow my heart would gush for Peeta and awe at his love of Katniss while instantaneously being petrified that either would die at any moment.  This is such an entertaining and stimulating read.  I would recommend it to anyone. I can't wait for the sequel!
Being a mature adult, I thought I had left YA fiction behind me. I picked this up since my 8th grader is reading this in school. I'm glad that we are both agreeing on at least one thing lately and that is that this book is very good.  Is there violence? Yes, but I would not say it is just for the sake of violence. As a parent I understand the apprehension other parents might feel at letting their children read this. On the other hand, I am in the camp that believes we have been coddling our children way too much in the last few decades as well as insulting their intelligence.  Some reviewers feel that the tributes did not rebel and only went along with what was asked of them. For some of the tributes this was true. But Katnis (and a few other tributes) do rebel. Albeit it is not in the way that we would expect, there are small rebellions throughout the story which add up to Katnis outsmarting the gamemakers in a witty and powerful manner. I will be reading the rest of the series, even if there isn't a happy ending.
My husband and I read these books together and really enjoyed the story. I usually read paranormal romance books and he reads non-fiction about social justice. Although we both loved the Harry Potter series.  What we liked: The social commentary about death and reality tv. The characters in the story (through all three books) are really impacted with the fact that they have killed someone. It haunts them. I thought the author really emphasized the idea that these are children making adult decisions and thrown into adult situations and its not good for their brains and emotions.  What we didn't like: Katniss whines a lot. Which seems to be typical of a teenage girl but sometimes it was really hard to read because she takes everything so personally and everything is about her all the time. Very teenage girl... it just got old.  Overall we enjoyed the books and dont like to see them compared to twilight because the story is not about the love triangle, although there is one in the story.
This book helped me find love for reading again. After picking up a few books every now and then, reading a couple chapters and then forgetting about them this book came to me as a surprise. I just purchased the kindle fire and the first book I decided to read was in fact the Hunger Games. Once I read the first few pages, I was hooked. I read the book for hours until I finished it in less than a day. I even read it aloud to a friend who couldn't help but tell me to keep reading as I flicked through the pages on my new kindle. The story follows the struggle of the main character, Katniss Everdeen as she is forced to battle one member from her "district" and 22 other district teens. There will be only one winner... I would recommend this book to anyone, in fact, I've already been telling everyone I know about it. I'm on the third book now, and I still can't put it down for more than a minute or two before curiosity overcomes me and I begin to immerse myself within the pages of this fantastic book series once more.
The plot reads like a Philip K. Dick novel.  A book about teens slaughtering other teens might give a 12 or 13 year old nightmares.  Hopefully it won't be made into a movie, but it probably will be. Reading about child murder is one thing, but seeing it would be intolerable. This isn't Tom Sawyer or even Harry Potter, the events portrayed in this book are brutal.  Although in many ways this book is a recycled SF book from the 1960's or 70's, what is exceptional about The Hunger Games is the development of the characters.  These are people that you really come to care about.  Even though the games are evil to the core, the people who put it on are not presented as bad people, nor is the protagonist without her flaws.  These are not comic book heroes and villains.  The action and suspense are relentless, even though the ending is predictable.  Pick this book up to read, and likely you'll end up finishing it at one sitting, and then go and download the next volume.  Which is exactly what this book is meant to do.
As a non-fiction writer (Your Mark On The World) I approached this book without any expectations and was quite pleasantly surprised.  The book is full of vivid characters that captivated my full attention, a fast moving plot that made the book hard to put down, and thought provoking questions that left me pondering the book long after I finished it.  The book is an imaginative story of a post-apocalyptic world with too few resources and governments run for the benefit of a small population of elites.  Despite the fact that I generally read non-fiction, I found this book to be compelling and thought provoking.  I would recommend the book to anyone interested in fantasy, science fiction, politics, or young adult fiction.  The book is painfully graphic in its description of violence, so I'd respect parent's who want to guide their children who may be interested in the book.  That said, I didn't find it objectionable.  Bottom line, this is a great book.
Not many books written these days make me cry, but this trilogy did, and more than once. It's non stop nail biting suspense. I can't wait to see the movie.
The less said about this fabulous, futuristic sci-fi story, the better. The super short, non-spoiler story is this: it's about a 16 year-old girl named Katniss that participates in the Hunger Games, a fight to the death between two persons (one male, one female) from each of the 12 "divisions" that make up a country called Panem, formerly the United States. The losers, as chosen "lottery" style, are sent to the Capitol, fattened up, trained, and otherwise prepared for the fight of their lives. Suzanne Collins, author of the Gregor the Overlander series, did everything right in her writing. With its faced-pace style, charismatic characters, clever creatures, imaginative descriptions, and a wee bit of romance, the only thing to complain about is the wait for the next installment. Fortunately for fans, the second in the series, Catching Fire, is due out at the start of September - yay!  Other good reads for YAs: The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, and The Giver by Lois Lowery.
I loved Hunger Games and Catching Fire. They are an engrossing read and Suzanne Collins skillfully keeps you turning pages until...OMG...where is book three, the Mokingjay? Talk about your major cliff hangers. When I finally marked off enough days, weeks, months on my calander and got Mokingjay in the mail, I was a lunatic to find out how it all ends. Literally read it in about 5 hours. Katniss Everdeen is a totally believable herion in a completely believable, but frightening future. Collins is a master storyteller taking current societal themes and weaving them into a terrifying post apocolyptic future in which Katniss must somehow conquer all. The love triangle in this book is one that inspires true angst. Both of Katniss's suiters are equally wonderful and the reader is hard pressed to decide on a favorite. Lukily, she knows her own mind there too! Mokingjay is an approptiately exciting, nail biting, climax to the series and at no time disappoints. Can't wait to see what Collins comes up with next.
Hubby picked this audio book pretty well blind.  He was surprised I had heard of it, and when I told him it was a "young adult" book he was abashed.  But I reassured him that many cool people thought it was great.  And it is.  Disturbing, yes, very much so, but also great.  We are on the last part of the last book and we'll be happy (I hope) with the ending, but also sad that there will be no more Hunger Games story.  The audio books are excellent, at the very top of the many we've listened too.  The woman who reads them could not be better, she is most convincing as our heroine.  I wish there was a way I could convey how excellent the story is and how superlative the audio version is with out getting all hyperbolic, but there isn't.  If you have a stomach for some gruesome situations and you don't mind some slight sci-fi and if, in any way, you like a spunky gal, read, or listen to, these books.  You will not be disappointed, discomforted perhaps, discombobulated definitely, but not dissappointed.
I love the hunger games trilogy , and the fact that they give you the audiobook with the Kindle edition is fantastic and a great deal for $8.99. It is definitely worth the buy and even if you don't utilize the audiobook as much as I do it's always handy to have because you can listen to it while you're in your car or you just can't read the book at the moment. The hunger games is in my opinion the best book in the trilogy. I know is the series progress people tend to like the second and third ones even more however I prefer the first one the most. Because cliffhangers are always the best in my opinion . They keep you sucked in, and I think that's the best part of book is when you get sucked in. Anyways this is a great by well worth the price to buy these separately the book or the audiobook separately together in price is $22 and if you buy it this way as a combo it's only seven dollars so this is a great deal. Highly recommend purchasing and it's convenient . And who doesn't love this series .
The Hunger Games, as the beginning of the identically named trilogy, is a marvelous book. Collins has a knack for making interesting characters and has managed to invent some interesting new concepts to the dead-horses of both the post-apocalypse and dystopian society. This book sets the stage well for a series that was obviously well-planned out. At no point is the reader left bewildered, and at times Katniss' first person introspective is so completely over-thinking the book's scenarios that I almost wrote her off as "simple." Almost. I highly recommend anyone interested read this book before it becomes a movie. In that case, you'll have two sets of characters to enjoy. The ones you'll envision and their film counterparts. You'll love the characters, so I'd recommend getting to know them as completely as possibly.  Despite what some people have said about the amount and extent of the violence, it is not as graphic and numbing as you'd believe. This book is written to a young adult audience.
The Hunger Games is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen who lives in district 12 in the Nation of Panem. Panem lies of what used to be known as North America. It has a rich Capitol surrounded by 12 poor districts. The Capitol keeps the districts from rebelling by making one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death live, on TV. When Katniss steps in to take her sister's place in the games, she knows that in order for her and her family to survive, she will have to make choices that are too unbearable to think about.   Overall, I think that The Hunger Games was a great book. I really liked the plot even though it was very violent. I also liked how fast-paced the book was.  If I could change anything in that book, I would have just made it last longer because I felt like 22 people died too quickly. I still give this book five stars. I have decided that The Hunger Games is the one and only book that can match Harry Potter.
I heard from friends how great the book was.  So I read the book's back cover.  Zero interest.  The trailer played prior to Breaking Dawn at the Midnight showing.  Several people in the audience cheered gleefully when they realize what the trailer is for.  So I watch, hoping for something to spark my interest.  Nothing.  But a friend asked me to read it so I could see the movie with her.  I welcomed the opportunity as I now felt I had a good reason to read it.  I started to read it Friday evening, annoyed at how far-fetched it was, and I was a little ticked at how it seemed that coal was vilified as if the book was going to be some tree-hugging, political agenda book disguised as a teenage novel.  But after the first 40 pages, I was hooked.  I took the book everywhere with me over the weekend until I finished it late Sunday morning.  It's been a long time since I've been so emotionally involved in a book.  I'm captivated and desperately wanting to run out for the second book now.  Bravo!
The Hunger Games was recommended to me and I am glad it was.  It is not probably a book I would have picked up otherwise primarily because it is classified as a young persons book.  Just goes to show you--never judge a book by it's cover, so to speak!  The book tells the tale of a 16 year old girl by the name of Katniss Overdeen.  Katniss lives in a North America of the future and a brutal place it is.  North America is divided up into 12 divisions.  Every year a girl and a boy is chosen from each division and it is a fight to the death.  After reading this, one may ask--WHY would I want to read a book about this?  Because Katniss is brave, she is loving, she has heart and the reader really cares about her.  Also, there are others in this book that only add to the book's gripping conclusion.  The author does a terrific job of pacing so the pages just fly and I could feel my stomach clench when a particularly dangerous situation comes up--which is darn near all of the time!  Loved it!
I am a middle school English teacher, so I spend my life reading young adult fiction.  This is my new favorite book!  It now tops my list over The Black Book of Secrets, Unwind, The Giver, and Twilight. I admit I was already a Collins fan from the Gregor books, but getting my students to read them with the Twilight books out there is almost impossible.  The Hunger Games, however, is THE book of the year in my opinion.  My students bring it back after 1 night and ask where is the second book.  Boys love it and girls love it!  My daughter had just finished Eclipse when she picked up The Hunger Games and pronounced it the best book she had EVER read!  This is a plot that is twisted, frightening and awesome all wrapped up in one.  There is unexpected death, relationships that are not what you want to believe and much more.  I was rooting for Katniss from the moment I met her.  I am absolutely on edge for Book 2....I just hope it can live up to the first one.  Thank you Suzanne Collins.
The Hunger Games is really little more than a repackaging of past stories.  There's Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, some Orwell's 1984 and even some aspects of Stephen King's Running Man (though probably more the movie than the book).  The characters are flirtatious yet chaste - yes, I know the book is for young readers but I would prefer they read about healthy relationships than barbaric savagery comprised of killing children for entertainment.  Despite these overriding issues, the story was basically flat for me, I can't say it was horrible.  Collins has used some good material in creating her own story, and the movie, which was also just okay, has made me slightly interested in reading the next book though I probably won't spend money on it.  Lastly, I've allowed my 9 (now 10) year old read both the Harry Potter series and Ender's Game, but I'm not letting him read this one because I don't think it's good enough to warrant exposing him to the violence of it.
Brutal, challenging, entertaining and as gripping as anything I've read in recent (or maybe not-so-recent) memory, THE HUNGER GAMES is the first installment of a trilogy that you can find in the Young Adult section of the bookstore.  But don't let that stop you.  It is not, in any way, for children.  Yes, it's about them.  But good lord, it's not for them.  A bleak dystopian speculative novel about a chilling government-run game (think Stephen King's THE LONG MILE penned by, I dunno, J.K. Rowling comes to mind), I dare you to pick this up and not long to sit and read it in one go.  Even more, see if you can avoid rushing to the bookstore (as I did) to pick up the second book the second you finish.  And then begin worrying about what you'll do to bide the time until the last book comes out in four long months.  It's that good.  So make your way past the Paddington Bear shelves, somewhere above (in every way) the TWILIGHT books and get started.  Go.  Now.  Call me when you're done.
I loved this book. The book causes so many different emotions: pity, sadness, anger, laughter, love.  The Hunger Games themselves kinda remind me of Survivor Extreme Edition. Think about it...the tributes (could be called tribe mates) are dropped in the middle of no where and they have to learn to survive live off the land. The extreme part comes in because they are trying to kill each other off. The games are then broadcasted on tv for others to watch.  I knew right away if Prim was selected that Katniss was going to try and take her place. She is the provider for the family and keeps them save.  I think Katness though really does have feelings for Peeta. She is a typical 16 yr old girl though and confused. She is also confused about her true feelings about her friend back home Gale.  I loved how at every chance Katniss had though she "stuck it to the man" so to speak. She is definitely a leader not a follower.  I can't wait until I have the time to read the next 2 books.
Katniss, a sixteen year old girl tribute from district 12, is forced to compete till death in The Hunger Games. She makes new friends and new relationships that lead to tragic and happy endings.  She has to fight through not being with family and the weather that the Game makers make harder to survive. Each night she listens to the Game anthem and sees everyone that died that day, and thinks to herself, I can be next. Katniss goes through days of starvation and without water. She must find a way to survive. But when the game makers make an unexpected twist, will she win the games after all? The Hunger Games was an amazing book! I thought this because there was a lot of action and fighting between the tributes and many unexpected twist. Such as in the beginning, when her sister Prim name is called instead of Katniss. If you like watching Survivor, you would like to read The Hunger Games.  It's a social and physical game, where only the strongest and smartest players survive
I don't really review products on amazon but I couldn't help but leave my feedback for The Hunger Games.  This book is one of the best books I've ever read, and it doesn't even have a swear word in it.  The suspense in the book never lets up and just when you think things are finally going to get better, something else bad happens.  Sure, I wanted to throw the book at times because I don't always agree with the characters (mostly Katniss when it comes to Peeta), but I still couldn't put the book down.  Almost every chapter ends with a cliffhanger and you can't help but read on.  I could literally read the book again and I just finished it.  I almost cried a couple of times as well; it can be that emotional.  I am just mesmerized by the writing abilities of Suzanne Collins.  The Hunger Games is easily my new favorite book.  If you want to read a book that will take you on a ride you'll never forget, then I highly recommend The Hunger Games.  This book will blow you away.
I'll admit, I was skeptical about starting this trilogy because I'm not usually into Sci-Fi. BUT- as soon as I started, I could not put this book down! I read the entire book in about 2 days, reading whenever I had a spare moment. I cannot wait to start the second, but I'm trying to wait a little bit because I know once I finish them all I'll miss them. I would definitely recommend the Hunger Games. It's captivating, intense, and exciting all the way through. You can't help but fall in love with Katniss, the narrator. I already feel so emotionally attached to her, and I'm so anxious to see what the next two books have to offer. If you are debating reading the Hunger Games- Just Do it!! You will not regret it! You are transported to another world, and you get to live it through Katniss' eyes. You get to experience her adrenaline as she participates in this deadly adventure, all the time trying to foresee who the victor will be! Enjoy the Hunger Games, I know you will!!
It's impossible to put this book down once you've started. It already has hundreds of reviews, but I wanted to add my five stars. I'm going to recommend it to both my teenaged children AND my adult book club. How's that for wide reaching? I think anyone over the age of 12 will find it very intriguing. Too graphically violent for ages under 12, in my opinion. A few years ago, I read and enjoyed Suzanne Collins' children's series about Gregor, but I'm glad to see that she's moved on to Young Adult, because I think it's more fitting for her rather dark, violent, intense, somewhat depressing topics. I hope this series doesn't end as hopelessly depressing as Gregor did. I love the author's harsh sense of reality, but I also like a happy ending, or at least an ending that leaves SOME hope. This book, The Hunger Games, is a nice mix of both dark fear and hope. The characters are well formed and very likeable. I eagerly await Book Three. And the movie, which I hear is coming.
Spoiler-Free Review:  I'm 26 years old and I loved this book. It's marketed for ages "12 and over" but I really do think it's an enjoyable read for anyone. It's a well written character-driven novel. The plot is interesting (think of the Survivor TV show but the contestants are between 12 and 18 and they have to kill each other) and constantly keeps you guessing but it's the emotional attachment to the characters that kept me hooked. Katniss Everdeen lives in a world of horrific government oppression but I liked that this wasn't a "good vs evil" story, there are shades of moral grey and complex emotions just like in the real world. It's a very violent story set in a violent world and I'm glad that it's not watered down.  This is the first in a trilogy, something that isn't advertised until you get to the end and it says "End of Book One." I'm definitely going to read the sequels. After you've read this you might want to check out [...] where there are some good video interviews with the author.  I highly recommended this book. Based on the title/cover/blurb I wasn't that interested but I'm very glad I read it. I'll be thinking about the characters until the sequels are published!
Don't start reading this book unless you plan on reading straight through!!! This book was absolutely enthralling, I just couldn't tear myself away from it. The dystopian society the book is set in is something eerie and surreal yet hauntingly similar to what I imagine the future could be like given the wrong circumstances. This book deals with some very difficult concepts, ideas, and decisions as the main character battles both in the physical world around her and within her own emotions and thoughts. The only negative comment I have is that I believe this book has been mis-categorized as youth or children's material. While the book is focused around a younger character it deals with some concepts and material that is beyond many young readers and maybe to violent for some. Depends on the child though, you know your children and should be able to easily judge if they are prepared for what they will encounter in the adventure that is the "The Hunger Games."
I liked it for what it is, but I did wish it was a little ... more.  It was a fast and crazy car chase of a book.  You feel yourself with Katniss, climbing trees, trying to out think the game, trying to out think your opponents.  It exhausts you, in a good way, because you totally invest it with them.  What I wished for though, was a little more about what goes on in the minds of the adults.  I'd hope to get that in the next two books as our girl grows up and starts her own family, but from what I've seen, we never really do get to that place.  I want to know how the adults cope with this utter lack of freedom, the inability to feed their families and make their lives.  What goes on in their heads about that?  How did they get to the place where they just accept the situation instead of fighting back?  How do they lose that sense that drives Katniss to not only compete, but survive and conquer, even defying all the powers that be all by herself?
The book arrived in perfect condition. Great price. Glad I got it. I always have great luck with books and appreciate not having to leave the house
Let me start out by saying, when I read this book I had no idea what this book was about.  Guess I had my head in the sand!  Anyway I overheard some young people talking about how good it was.  I understand there is a movie, which I have never seen either.  I have read the whole trilogy: Hunger Games, Catching Fire &amp; Mockingjay.  I do not want to say too much because I don't want to give anything away, but I loved, loved this series.  Soon after I started reading the first book, I realized these were probably written for people in their teens &amp; 20's.  I absolutely could not put any of these books down.  I was obsessed until I finished the last book (Mockingjay).  I highly recommend this series for any age group.  Yes, there is violence, but I would say it's rather like in the movie Avatar, a fantasy.  All that being said I am 76 years old and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole series, but you must read the series, in order.  I hated to finish the series!
Wow, this book turned out to be much better than I had hoped for.  I actually couldn't put it down and found myself taking it with me wherever I went in hopes of getting in a few extra minutes of reading.  The book is the first in a powerful trilogy.  The basic synopsis is that American as we know it is long gone and a new country stands in its place.  The country is divided into districts that each have their own separate jobs to do.  The all-powerful capitol makes life in the districts miserable.  But the capitol's power is questioned when a girl named Katniss challenges their authority in their own death games: The Hunger Games.  A possible revolt is on the distant horizon, but I won't say anymore so I don't ruin the book.  Overall, the characters are well developed and believable.  Also, the book's outcome is unique and unpredictable.  The book is action packed and suspenseful and hard to put down.  A great opener for an amazing trilogy.
I heard so much hype about this book (and the whole book series) that I decided to give it a try but I went into it with some hesitation. I realized that this was a book that had been intended for younger audiences (I'm 41) but I'd seen fb posts from friends my age who loved it so why not? Wow!! I must admit I was blown away! Once I started reading I was sucked into this story within just a few pages. It was not "dumbed down" for younger readers, it was wonderfully written and I truly believe it could appeal to many age groups. Even though I'm old enough to be Katniss' mom, I had no problem identifying with her character. I loved how she was not the stereotypical "weak girl" and indeed was a very tough and intimidating character. I purchased the second book in the series before I had even finished this one...I wanted to be ready to continue! You won't be disappointed...until you finish the series and realize there's no more Katniss stories to read!!
This is one of the rare books that grabs you from the first chapter and doesn't let go.  I had a hard time putting this book down! I found it interesting that the author was able to have me cheer on the main characters without reveling or being in any way happy about the demise of the others.  In fact this book made me tear up a couple times - which is highly unusual for me!  The author paints very clear pictures in few words. You get to know the characters in sprinklings of information given in just the right doses throughout the book.  If I have a complaint, it's that the ending was vaguely anti-climactic and abrupt, but I suppose that's to be expected when there's another book or two following. How the people "back home" are reacting to the games is left to the imagination a little more than I'd liked, until I realized they were probably reacting just like I was as the reader - helpless to stop it, but can't look away even for a second.
Collins presents engaging, sympathetic characters in untenable, infuriatingly unjust and cruel circumstances. You'll swing between tearing your hair out over the female protagonist's obstinacy and calculating coldness and loving her for her cleverness and valiance in the face of horrific injustice.  Your heart will ache for all those guileless and good, ensnared in an immoral and unwinnable game of politics and power, will rage at the willingly wicked, wasteful and obtuse supporters of such a corrupt and cruel system, and will break for lost innocence, stillborn as a matter of course and murdered if it manages to survive. This book is about the figurative and literal loss of humanity that happens when people choose strategy over compassion, and the struggle-- both on a national and a much smaller, personal scale-- to do what is right, even in the face of overwhelming odds; to survive under terrible circumstances without losing your heart and soul.
Hunger Games was like a bag of warm chocolate chip cookies to me!  I literally devoured it like I was starving.  I saw the movie first and really loved it but then my 12 year old grandson (that's right, I am about as far from being a Young Adult Reader as you can get) told me that I simply had to read the book...it's GREAT, Nana, he said!  And he was oh so right.  The story is simply gripping, the characters and settings are so real but deliciously fantastical at the same time!  All the time I was reading it I was completely immersed in the story but at the same time marveling at the creative genius of Susan Collins.  I mean how many authors can write with such skill that they can make you cry out, gasp, even weep when you already know exactly what is going to happen on every single page! Absolutely the best read I have had in a long time...cannot wait to start Catching Fire and then Mockingjay!  Susan Collins and Katniss Everdeen...I LOVE YOU!!!
This book is amazing and is my fav of the series the movie is also great will definitely read again and again and tell friends and family about it
There's another YA series in town!  The Hunger Games was absolutely mesmerizing.  I was completely captivated from the first sentence.  I read this book WHENEVER I could until it was finished, and I still haven't been able to stop thinking about it.  It literally blew me away.  I am usually not one for science fiction, but the world that Suzanne Collins has created is equal parts horrifying and addicting.  The book is told in first person narrative through the eyes of Katniss (who by the way is a great character!).  She takes her sister's place in the Hunger Games in which children are pitted against each other in a "fight to the death" arena.  This book will not be for everyone.  It is violent, sad, and horrific.  Children are forced into a horrible circumstance and death is almost guaranteed.  Katniss's ability and will to survive are inspiring as she navigates relationships, fears, and threats from the Hunger Games.  Read this!
I could easily post a long and detailed review but that has been covered many times by the previous reviewers.  The truth about this book is that once you pick it up, you don't want to put it down.  It has all the things you look for in a book, suspense, drama, action, romance (of a sort), intrigue and more.  It also makes you think....  I love when an author can do what Suzanne Collins did in this book.  She made you place yourself in the protagonists shoes and think to yourself how you would react in her situations.  What would you do?  I know the story is a bit far-fetched with children being pitted against each other to the death.  But it's a story of a totalitarian society.  Who didn't love "V for Vendetta"?  The reader has to remember this is a post-apocalyptic style world hundreds of years from our future.  What we hold as values today don't exist then.  But, keeping that in mind the story is wonderfully written.  The only con I can think of is I would knock a half a star off for some annoying spelling and grammatical errors that may or may not exist in the print version of the book but do exist in the Kindle version.  They are forgivable however.
The Hunger Games is definitely without a doubt the best book I have ever read. In my opinion it is better than the Twilight series and right up there with Harry Potter. If you're thinking about getting this book, GET IT!!! I am a 13 year old girl writing this review under my mom's account, and I learned about this book when one of my teachers read it to us during class. The whole class was crazy about the book, begging the teacher to read just a few more pages because at every end of the chapter the author left you hanging. After we had finished reading it I went ahead and bought it because it was one of my favorites and I wanted to have a copy of my own. I even made my mom read it because I loved it so much and she loved it as well. GREAT for all ages and BOTH genders. It's hard to say what genre it is since it includes action, adventure, romance, violence, suspense, and more. Makes a great gift. I can't wait to read the 2nd and 3rd book!
I posted this in a discussion thread, already about this book.  Suzanne Collins has a knack for telling a story that is filled with memorable characters facing impossible situations. With equal parts adventure and heartbreak, she paints a picture of humanity at it's best, and at it's worst. Compelling characters, vivid locations, action/adventure, and a world slightly off it's kilter, combine to give us another interesting storyline. After inhaling her Gregor the Overlander series as quickly as the books were written, and absolutely loving the ride, I was glad to see she has not lost her touch.  "The Hunger Games" is set in a futuristic society where two young people from each district (twelve in all) will battle it out to the death for the amusement of the citizens to watch on tv. This book will be released to the public in October 2008, and will be a multi-book storyline. No word on how many books are set to be part this series, as of yet - hoping for many!  Suzanne Collins remains one of my favorite young adult authors of all time. It was a total thrill to meet her, and get her to sign my copy of this book at the recent ALA Convention. As a school librarian to many avid readers desperate for the kinds of stories she tells, she is like a rock star to some of my students who gobble up every book she writes. Hope she is home now and working on the next book...which I am already impatiently waiting for!  Michelle
I was apprehensive to read this because for the most part I'm not a fan of young adult fiction. After the many great reviews I had gotten from friends, and of course my wife's glowing review, it was time to give it a shot. With those reviews I was warned that it might be a slow starter but I was hooked two chapters in.  I'm a fan of the dystopian style novel and figured this couldn't be all bad. I loved the concept, from the beginning I could imagine the anxiety everyone must feel as there children are drafted for the games through a random lottery. Having a son of my own, I know I would be terrified until I knew that his name was not chosen or until he won the games. This made it easy to identify with the characters and share in the emotions of the story.  I'm now hooked and can't wait to start the next book. With the movie releasing soon I'm very excited to compare the two. I hope it is good because I am now a fan.
I was determined not to read this book. I was tired of getting sucked into the new popular series (Harry Potter, Twilight, Girl with Dragon tattoo etc) Not to mention I can't stand anything (movies, books, tv shows) having to do with a post-apocalyptic setting.  Well I gave in to the peer pressure and purchased the Hunger Games. I read the first hundred pages the first night and went to work tired and bleary eyed. I finished it the next day and haven't been able to stop talking about it.  Honestly, this book has NOTHING in it that I thought would appeal to me. Young adult novel, violent, depressing, post-apocalyptic etc. It was one of the best, most exciting books I have read in a very long time. I think a lot of the negative views are those who once again cannot seperate fact vs fiction.  Enjoy the book for what it is. A high powered adventure about survival.  My only concern now is when are my next 2 books in the series arriving????
I LOVE this book!!! I've read it 3 times and about to read it a 4th. Some people read the summary and think this book would be horrible, but it is not! As you read, you fall in love with the characters: Katniss, Rue, Peeta. I am in love with Peeta and cry everytime Rue dies. Katniss is so smart and I wish I were her!  It's like sci-fi, survivor, man vs. wild, and a love story with humor mixed in. The first of the 3 parts is kind of slow, but once they get in the arena, you can't put it down! I hate reading and I read 200 pages of this book for 6 hours straight! The end of the games is happy, the end of the book is sad, but the characters in this book make it incredible. It's written in 1st person and presence tense, so it feels like you're right beside Katniss every step of the way. I reccomend this book to anyone looking for something good to read. This book is AMAZING and every one should read it. THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!
When I first heard the premise, I was very much against reading this or in any way supporting the product. It seemed very much like a direct rip-off of my favorite satire movie, Battle Royale, which pre-dates this publication about by a decade. However, curiousity from all the positive reviews got me to give this a sneak peek.  To my dismay, I was hooked from the start. The premise is very simple. In an unnamed post-apocalyptic future, a new society has formed in what was once North America. It is called "Panem", centered by a Capitol and 13 surrounding districts, whom basically act like slave territories supplying all the needs for the Capitol citizens. But that's not all! Because of a rebellion that occurred 74 years ago, to instill peace through fear, the supreme governing powers that be in the Capitol have decided that each year two children, between the ages 12-18, will be submit from each of their districts as tributes. The tributes will battle to the death in a televised arena that every citizen is required to watch, as a reminder of what happened 74 years ago.  Surprisingly, Susanne Collins makes the story very easy to read and believable, as if this could very well happen. It is not hard to see how a society, which is based on supreme rule and fear-- might actually take the path chosen by the people of Panem. --How the citizens of the subject districts might abandon all hope and actually do let something as terrible as the sacrifice of their children in a gruesome lottery.  Just look at North Korea for an example of this in modern society. OR even look at history, after WWI, the Allied forces were so determined to pin the blame of war on someone, they treated Germany very much like the districts. Imposing ridiculous punishments towards the citizens, which eventually led to WWII.  Having read all 3 of these books, the first is very much the best. It is a very quick read, as that it is written in present-tense, perspective of the protagonist, Katiness Everdeen.  This is very light reading. The first book touches briefly on the atrocities of war, but mostly focuses on survival and how society can become very easily warped. I finished this book in one day, reading from 7pm to 1am, then eagerly ran out to buy the rest of the books the next morning.
In search of the next Harry Potter I tried this series, though I am sad to say it fell short.  At times the story was an enjoying read, but all the inconsistensies in the story kept annoying me. I actually read the entire series to perhaps get an explanation (as it is in fact critically acclaimed), but that never happened, and Im left with a feeling af wasting 30$ and hours of reading.  It is hard to be spesific without pointing out the quite simply illogical action, so if you are new to the series stop reading here  **SPOILERS** (a few from book 3 also)  - The writer fails to explain why the hunger games is in fact a workable scheme. I am really quite aware of what human beings can do to each other (eg. WW2 eastern front + holocaust, as probable low points..), but usually evil doing happens for a reason, and getting kids to kill each other for fun, and make the parents watch and celebrate the event is really just a recipe for a major uprising (it just doesnt make sense to use it to control the districts as the writer claims).  - When the kids are picked you would get a lot of them refusing to just play along and smile to the cameras, though that didnt happen here. Why? I found battle royal way more credible in that sense.  - In the arena there are cameras literally everywhere. With such technology the capitol would have little trouble to follow every move of Katniss and the other rebels after the games, and uncover their scheme.  - After the games, every credible dictator would have Katniss killed. It would be so easy to let her have a "hunting accident" while out in the woods. Just get a few shots of her out in the forbidden woods and air it with pictures of the corpse; problem solved (silly little girl got herself killed while doing illegal hunting).  - In book 3 it gets worse (Katniss shooting down high-tech choppers with a bow and arrow wtf?; the capitol using bunker busters on dc 13.. why not send off one every 3 hours to shut down the entire rebellion? it just doesnt make sense that they send like 4 busters then quit; why doesnt the capitol fire nukes when they get exterminated?; why use nets as traps in the street in the capitol? every decent insurgeon in Iraq knows a couple of 155mm shells is vastly superior to a net!)  OK I could go on and on.. In short; the book just isnt credible enough, and the main characters are too shallow to be interesting.
The Hunger Games (Book 1)  This book is amazing. I think it's good for almost all reading levels. I probably wouldnt recomend it for children under 11 because there is the use of violence, but that is truely up to the parents. The Hunger Games is a great read and keeps your attention through out the story. I could not stop reading it.  At first I was kind of weary about reading a book where children are killing each other to win a competition. It turns out to be a wonderful story. Suzanne Collins really invests everything into this book. She creates an amazing connection to the characters. There were many instances where I could feel what they were feeling and just understand what was being said. There is a wonderful use of imagery and tons af detail used through out this book.  If you have not read this book yet I highly recomend it, even if you have already seen the movie.
Honestly I had never heard of The Hunger Games until it came out as a movie.  I'm in my 40's I'm not exactly in the demographics for this book.  Recently I caught the movie on Netflix and really enjoyed it.  Figured the book had to have more information about everything (books are always better than the movie) - so I picked the book up (well rented it on my Kindle Fire).  AND I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  I had seen the movie, I knew actually how it ended, but I was so totally enthralled with the story.  It is a very interesting and very well written story.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to start reading the second book.  In fact, I just started reading the second book yesterday.  I sat and read for 7 hours last night.  I only stopped because it was 1:30 a.m. and I had to work today.  I am glad that I saw the movie first to put some of the descriptions of the people in The Capital in perspective, but not really necessary.
When I tell you what The Hunger Games trilogy is about, you might question my judgement.  It's set in a futuristic world where the Capitol reigns supreme over the oppressed Districts 1 to 12.  To keep them in their place, each year the Capitol selects two children from each District - one boy and one girl - to compete in an annual reality television show.  Their mission: To kill the other contestants. Last child standing wins.  Despite this macabre premise, The Hungers Games trilogy - consisting of The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay - is a compelling read with a serious message about war.  It's teen fiction in the same vein as John Marsden's Tomorrow When The War Began series.  While written for a younger audience, The Hunger Games appeals across age groups. I have a number of friends in their 20s and 30s who devoured all three books at rapid pace.  This is partly because it's an easy read, partly due to the strangely gripping plotline and partly due to author Suzanne Collins' ability to end chapters with cliffhangers that leave you wanting more.

WARNING SPOILERS ALERT  ----------------------  America is destroyed. Poverty lies everywhere. Starvation is now the most common death because only the wealthy can afford food. These are the remains of the last Great War. What was left of North America, joined together to form the country Panem, a country that consists of 12 districts. Each year the districts must send forth two tributes, a boy and a girl, to compete in the HUNGER GAMES. The tributes must compete for survival when they are placed in the arena and fight to the death. Winning means wealth and prosperity, losing means certain death.  This is an absolute, no questions asked, five star book. It doesn't tell you anything in the beginning, just clues that you can make predictions with. My family purchased this on amazon.com, and it was delivered in perfect condition. Five stars for the book and five stars for the delivery.
Suzanne Collins has written one of the most incredible books I have had the pleasure of reading in "The Hunger Games".  Partly science fiction, mixed with heart wrenching drama, along with action adventure that keep you on the edge of your seat, this book will keep you up reading long past bedtime, and is so hard to put down, I finished only stopping once to charge my Kindle, and could not wait to finish.  Not too involved to the point of ever becoming boring, and not leaving you wanting for more, this book is the perfect balance and a must read for anyone interested in just a plain different, excellently written book with as unique a story line as I have seen in quite a while.  To think Mrs Collins just made this up out of thin air makes the reader appreciate that this author is as intelligent and imaginative as they come.  Thank you for this story and I hope you can come up with another one as unique as this one!
I knew the basic outline of the story when I read "Hunger Games", but I was unprepared for the strong emotions I felt while reading it. Many issues were raised: Am I fake? Or am I true to myself? How much should other people manipulate me? Whom should I trust, and who will betray me? Will my friends remain my friends? And my body: is it too heavy? Too thin? How do I appear to everybody else? Am I strong enough?  As a woman (54 years young!) who, as a young girl, was known to wander around through trees and the creek with her trusty Bowie knife in her jeans pocket, I could relate to Katniss. She was so in tune with the nature around her. Also, she had such a sense of loyalty to her mom, to her sister, to Gale - a sense of loyalty which, out of necessity, is common to those who don't grow up in the upper class of society.  I loved this ultimate reality book. Those over 12 will love the trilogy.
I am an avid reader.  Yet I'm not often compelled to find the Amazon page and right a review for a book. . .  but this book deserves it.  I found out about this book via a brief description in Entertainment Weekly (I think Stephen King mentioned it).  I found the idea compelling, and sought out the book.  I've recently read "The Road" and "Pesthouse" (I'm not a Carmac fan . . .).  I found this book about 10x more addictive than either of those books.  Some literary scholar may point out a win on the other post-apocalyptic books. . .but in my mind a book is only as good as it keeps you from putting it down  - and I couldn't put this down.  The story is from the point of view of a young teen girl, and I found it refreshing (even though I'm a full adult male).  The story is spot on, and the ending states "END OF BOOK ONE" leaves me a tad bit of hope - that the adventure in this world isn't finished. . .
Well it is what it says it is. The first book is fantastic. Great characters, interesting plot, lots of unexplained backstory for the imagination. I read it almost instantly I was so hooked. It's also probably one of the better book to movie adaptations. Obviously there are changes and it's missing/has new stuff, but overall it's WAYYYY more accurate than of the Tolkien or Harry Potter movies.  It's not the perfect book, but it's a great read. I'm reading the second now and I'm a little worried about the lovestory taking over the good parts. So at this point, the biggest advantage the first book has is it focuses on the plot we were told about. Which was a great plot. I'm not big into the romance aspect of teen novels, and a love story is always welcomed, but this is getting kinda cheesy. In any case, the first book is great, but it seems a bit...unique, compared to the other books in the trilogy.
After the hype surrounding the film I preferred to read the series first and was gripped from the start.  The Hunger Games is an extremely descriptive, fast moving book which drew me in and kept hold until the very end.  At one point it even almost made me cry.  I enjoyed the fact that the story is told from the main character's point of view, of her world set in the future but still recognisable. Apparently aimed at the teen reader any adult would find the book absorbing and thought provoking.  It is a world of division between the elite and the downtrodden, severely controlled workers who provide the necessities to maintain the elites' existence.  Part of the control is to send teenagers into a competition where it is kill or be killed, the last survivor achieving fame and fortune for themselves and their district.  Catniss provides the focus for revolution.  You cannot help but read the complete trilogy.
I love this series!  I was instantly hooked and was so bummed after finishing the last book in the series because it was over and there were no more to read. :(  Good news is the movie is coming out in 2012, bad news is the movie is never as good as the book.  I have read articles that compared this series to Twighlit as being the next big thing.  While I admit that I like Twighligt, I like this series much more. It has much more depth to the story.  There is the romance and love triangle that we all love, but there is also the story about the state of their society and what they are forced to do that adds a whole new element to the story.  The characters are a bit more mature and the teens aren't dealing with trivial things like teen angst or prom, etc.  At times this book brought me to tears at how tragic it was, but other parts gave me butterflies and hope as a love story often does.  Great book!
I figured out the ending a third of the way through...  So, while the action kept the reading bearable, I kept waiting to see how Collins handled some of the character development plot lines she created. She never did use them. What a disappointment.  First: In the beginning, Collins alludes to Katniss having to make the decision to become a hunter of people or not. Can Katniss kill someone in cold blood? Can she lie in wait for her human prey to cross her path, and then stare them down and kill them? Unfortunately, we never see her face that dilemma.  Second: Both Katniss and Peeta make a kill, yet we never see any of the effect that kill has on them. They killed a human. How can that not affect them? Even after the games end, there is no reflection of what they've done, only concern about what is yet to happen. And a bit of self-congratulations.  Third: I expected something more to develop from Katniss' wearing of the Mocking Jay pin. It was explained in some detail, yet it disappears while Katniss is in the arena. Then suddenly it appears again at the end.  The action in the book kept me going, but for this to be a great book, it really needs more character development. I will probably read the remainder of the books only because they are a quick read, and I still hold hope that Collins will use her next book to develop her characters more.
I read all three of these books in 4 days after seeing the movie trailer... if that doesnt tell you how great they are, I dont know what will. This book is amazing. Normally not a fan of "post apocolypse" genre books, this book brought a whole new light to how the world might be in the future. The storyline grips you and the author has a way of making you feel everything that everyone in the book is feeling at that time. The shere genius of making you feel like your starving, hunting, thirsting to death, beginning to feel love for someone, and making you feel what Katniss feels when shes fighting for her life is amazing. You will laugh, cry, and sit on your seat in anger at the capitol throughout this entire book. You will feel like you have been thrown right in the middle of the arena along with Katniss and the other contestants, and then be starving for the next book by the end. Amazing read!!!
I read this book several months ago from the library and was hooked. I had to get my own copy and kept checking for the next book in the series. I found it on Amazon and pre-ordered it so I can have it as soon as it comes out.  Katniss Everdeen is a truly believable character. She is a teenager with a head on her. She is forced to support her mother and little sister when her father is killed in a mine explosion. This prepares her for her fight to the death in the Hunger Games, but not for Peeta's profession of love.  The story pulls you in and you cannot put the book down. Then at the end it is just beginning and you groan to yourself since you will have to wait until the next book to find out what happens between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. Will Prim still be in the lottery for the next Hunger Games since she is only twelve? How will Katniss keep her safe?  Totally and completely a good read.
I love it when I snag a book that I know nothing about except that a friend said it was good, and wind up reading it in two sessions. Fortunately, I didn't "discover " this book before the author had all three of them written. I just finbished "Catching Fire", also in two readings, and was surprised that the author was able to out do herself. The second book is better than the first, only because the reader is already aware of the personalities of the characters, and the setting. Opening the second book is like meeting old friends. I look forward to the last of the trilogy not only because it closes out the series, but because it did get somewhat mixed reviews. I gather that it didn't end the way a lot of people wanted it to, with good things happening to the good people and the bad guys getting their just deserts. I will probably like the book since I tend to be more of a pessimistic realist.
Had to add my two cents to the thousands of people who weighed in. I LOVED this book. Read the series, paused for about 2 breaths and started it all over again. Immediately.  I liked Katniss as a main character. At 17, she is very aware of what it takes to survive just on a daily basis. She has no time for boys and doesnt see herself the way others do. She is entirely focused on her family and making it back to them because she knows they need her. Enter the games. Exciting and thought provoking. What would it take to survive in a future where you have no control of your life and were under the thumb of the Capitol? Could you kill to survive?  Second book is also great. Third book- also good but not as epic as the first two. It was an attempt to end a series that had no natural conclusion within the world that was created.  I have recommended this book to close friends and all my family.
The reviews for this book are so numerous that I am sure that mine will simply be just lost in the crowd. So let me just say that this was a surprisingly good book and that while it was written on the young adult level, this could have just as effectively been written on an adult level.  While the outcome of the book and the resolution of the problems that the main character Katniss faces seem simple on the surface there is an underlying tension that runs throughout the entire book that simply does not let up even on the last page.  The author has achieved something that so many other writers fail at and that is creating a story that seems to pull you along and even on some level make you a participant (is the reader really any different than one of the watchers of the Hunger Games?)  This is an excellent book that takes the survivalist and death-as-entertainment theme to another level.
I had no clue what to expect from this book... it was recommended to me by a colleague and darn near everyone at work had read it and reported about it glowingly.  After the first 1/3rd of the book I could see why -- wonderfully crafted!  The beauty here is not in the dystopia or the work Collins creates.  Those are nice and at best, as good as anyone else can do... the beauty and power is in Katniss Everdeen.  Suzanne Collins writes her with such depth and detail that you cannot help but feel like you are her best friend.  Like you are going through it all with her... from the drama at the reaping to the power of the hunger games to the tearing apart of her relationships... Katniss is your friend.  As an author myself who works hard at creating characters for readers to identify with and feel for... Ms. Collins has done it.  And I learned a thing or two while reading The Hunger Games!
I'd heard about these books for quite a while and with the movie coming out soon, I decided to give it a try. The truth is, I didn't know what to expect. Descriptions of the story do not do it justice.  The first chapter was hard to get wrapped into the story. First person perspective and storytelling would not allow me to connect wholly to Katniss and her world. However, the 2nd chapter on I could not put the book down. I tried to find any way to work another chapter here and there throughout the day.  I fell in love with each and every character to walk in and out of Katniss's life. I felt for each one of them as though I knew them personally and marveled at how invested I was in each. I may not have liked some, but to me they were still full bodied, believable characters.  While reading most of the Games, I was a wreck! If I could have held the book and bite my nails, I would have.
I got a new Kindle for Christmas and I was looking for a new book to read. My friend who is in school studying to be a school teacher told me that this book is being used a lot in schools to try to get kids interested in reading. She told me I HAD to read it. Well I was skeptical because it did not sound like a book I would ever read, especially since they read it in schools (which I found most of those books boring). I read this book in about a day and could not wait to start the next one. It really draws you in and it is such a great, powerful story. The lead character is a girl which just makes this book so much better in my eyes since you rarely see such a strong female lead. I am in my early 20's and love this book. I have encouraged everyone I know no matter what their age is to read it. I just finished the entire series and I want to turn around and read this book again.
The Hunger Games is one of those books that most "real" readers like to scoff at. I have to admit that I had my doubts that Collins would come through, but, man, was I impressed.  This book was probably one of the most captivating, entertaining reads that I've had in years. Katniss is an incredibly strong, lead, female character -- something that is rather non-existent or not so believable in literature these days. And the story is terrific. You never, ever want to put the book down.  Sure, the language is written for a young adult. And the reader isn't so challenged when it comes to figuring out what's going on. However, Collins just crushes it on everything else. Not to mention, it's not such a bad commentary on some of the ridiculous things that are going on in our society today.  All I have to say is give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.
I'm not that into the Harry Potter or Twilight series but this book and series captivates. It has a strong female protagonist and moves along at a good pace. Once past all the exposition, the book is difficult to put down and leaves the read hanging on for more by the end. So I got the rest of the series. Two thumbs up. I see why it's so popular now and why it's been made into a movie.  Taking place in a future society where a major war has left the populace under the watchful eye of a dictator big brother government which sends it's teenager in to an arena to fight for their lives for the entertainment of the elite, live the experience of being chosen and then taken from all one knows into a world of fighting for oneself the eyes of Katniss Primrose. By book two, the attachment to the characters and situation becomes much more personal. Great for teens and adults.
When you're reading The Hunger Games, you are preoccupied with the immediate terror of: will Katniss survive? Will Peeta survive? What's going to happen next??? The raw suspense is by far the predominant reading experience of The Hunger Games. But it is in the days and weeks after you finish the book -- after you've already gone onto other books -- when you realize that you're still thinking about Katniss, Peeta, and Rue. You realize that these characters and the world Suzanne Collins has created for them have stayed with you long after you closed the book. Their world continues to haunt you in the back of your mind; their bravery continues to humble and inspire you. In my experience as a reader, this is the mark of truly great writing. It is a rare thing, and it is what I'm always hoping to find when I open a new book, and what I'm hoping to revive when I open an old one.
Wow.  Okay I'm a Christian and almost have never read anything but Christian fiction in the last 23 years. I could not put this book down.  I started it last night and finished it 24 hours later.  It was a cross between Survivor, Big Brother, 1984 (hated that book) and who knows what else.  This is not for faint hearted people for several reasons.  If you have a fear of fire or bees, don't read this. I found this story compelling and cannot understand the one 3 star rating that I did read.  What did you expect this girl to act like, living the life she lived?  How can any person exhibit any emotion when they are more than set in a survival mode?  I haven't seen the movie and I'm axious to see how well they stay in tune with the book. The setting was real, the emotions gribbing and I could easily picture the characters in the book.  Really good storyline and setting.
Life as I knew it ceased to exist after reading The Hunger Games. These books are littered with between the line messages about our own privileged human existence. I look at fashion, Lady GaGa for example and cannot help feeling the way Katniss did when she meet her make-over team at the capital. I watch NFL football and I cannot help but think of myself as a game-maker and the players as tributes; right down to their post game interviews.   It's deliciously scary when the realization comes that we are them, they are us. The pain, the starvation in the districts while there is gluttony in the capital, the way children are used as pawns to gain power, all of these themes and more play themselves out on the streets of America (and our whole world) every night.  Suzann Collins, brilliant message I'll never forget again!  We can all be Katniss!  Thank you.
This is a horrifyingly good book, so much so that I had to put it down twice and walk away before I could continue for fear of what would happen next.  In a dystopian future US, there is no bread and one circus, the Hunger Games, in which 24 "tributes" (forced volunteers) duel to the death on camera with the whole world watching whether they want to or not.  The narrator is a 16-year old girl, Katniss, the sole support of her mother and 10-year old sister back home.  Her sister is chosen in the reaping and Katniss volunteers to take her place in the Games.  The plot is like American Idol crossed with Survivor, only in this case children are killing children as a national spectator sport, which is where the horrifying comes in.  By the last page you know what it was like at the Coliseum, from both the cheap seats and the floor of the arena.  A riveting read.
I absolutely LOVED this story. I heard about this book and was told it was a little weird at first, a little far-fetched. However, I didn't feel this way in the least bit. I completely enjoyed this book from first starting to read it and it just got better and better...I could NOT put this book down. I loved the characters Katniss and Peeta, loved their back story, loved everything about them. I am currently reading it to my 8 year old son, and he loves it too. I think its a really important look at how the world we know could change at any minute, and that all the things we take for granted (like food, electricity, etc.) could be gone in an instant. Makes you wonder if you have what it takes to survive.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick/easy read. To anyone looking for a story that really makes you think and take stock in your own life.
Before I begin I'd like to say that if any of you have read negative reviews dismiss them. This book is spectacular. This is coming from a girl who has read harry potter and the eragon books, both of which I would recommend. I thought I would never again be lost in that world where time and space matter not, where you would stay up till 5am just to keep reading. Where nothing can distract you. But that was before I read the Hunger Games.  I found myself reading every moment I could, during dinner, whilst brushing my teeth, everywhere! Every moment I wasn't reading, felt like a waste. When I wasn't reading I wanted to be reading. I have just finished reading the Hunger Games for the 4th time, and tomorrow I will begin again. I can't stop reading, can't put them down. Mark my words, this story will stay with you forever. Read this story and read it now!!!
I went into reading this thinking it was "just another teen drama", but thought I'd give it a try. I was hooked from the beginning. The author does an amazing job of creating characters that have qualities that make us fall in love with them, and the dystopian setting where the story takes place is imaginative, but still believable.  While not a difficult read, I found myself glued to the pages, desperately wanting to know what the heroine, Katniss, was going to do next.  I would definitely recommend this to any reader, whether it be teen or adult, because there are human qualities portrayed that speak to all ages, and sometimes it forces us to look at ourselves and challenge our own beliefs, when faced with a dystopian future that pins it's children together in a fight to the death for the means of entertaining the wealthier class.
SPOILERS! BEWARE!  I'm going to start off by saying I loved this book. It was amazing - it kept me on edge and I finished it in one day. The idea was great and Suzanne Collins pulled it off wonderfully.  However, there's one part that I'm rather skeptical about, the part when Katniss and Peeta decided to eat the nightlock. I feel like it was a little cliched, as if they were saying "let's die together because our love is everlasting!"  I understand that they did it to rebel against the Capitol, but to me it reminded me of  DIVERGENT/ALLEIANT SPOILERS BELOW  when Tris sacrificed herself.  Except neither Katniss nor Peeta died.  All in all though, this is a fabulous book and I'd recommed it to anyone who wants a fast-paced read with lots of action, excitement and a little 'romance'.
I absolutely loved the entire series.  The first book I read in 24 hours.  My eyes were so strained but I COULD NOT put this book down.  I eventually read the whole series in one week.  Please note that I am an occasional reader in that I generally I squeeze in a little reading before going to bed.  With the first book, I totally immersed in the characters, the setting, the plot....  I must admit the 2nd and 3rd books slowed down a bit but the action was still intense and storylines very interesting.  When I heard the movie was being released soon and after reading the reviews, my interest was piqued.  I am so very glad I had an opportunity to read the book before seeing the movie. I am afraid no movie can top the height and depth of my imagination as I devoured the uniqueness of this story.  At your earliest opportunity, you should read these books.
I ignored this series for too long due to the storyline being so similar a Japanese book that will not be named.  Turns out that I was totally wrong.  While both books involve children killing children and the sick people who enjoy this happening that's where the similarity ends.  This book spent a lot of time on the political aspects of the story.  It wasn't just a blood bath to be enjoyed by the sick and twisted.  From start to finish I was literally unable to put this series down.  Some of the minor characters were flat, but the ones that drove the story were anything but that.  They slowly evolved as the book and the series went on.  I was barely able to put this book down and had to buy the second and third books in the series right away.  Finishing all three over the course of a weekend.  Amazing book!
What an amazing book. I read this before watching the movie, and if you haven't read the book or have not seen the movie then I would definitely read the book first. The way Suzanne writes the book, you can't help getting sucked into the pages. The first time I read the book, I read it out loud to my husband while we were driving to Colorado. I read it cover to cover in the amount of time it took us to drive from the middle of Kansas to Colorado Springs, Colorado. I could not put it down and anytime I stopped reading my husband would ask when I would start reading again. The next day I had to go out and buy "Catching Fire." It is really a book for any age and has so many different messages that can help people today. Suzanne did a wonderful job telling everyone about Katniss, Peeta, and all the other characters in this series. Great job!
It took me a long time to finally get around to reading this book. All the hype surrounding it really deterred me. I was put off by how popular it was and the type of crowd that seemed to be into it. The same people who loved the Twilight Series really seemed to be into this book.  It turns out I was only punishing myself. What I thought was going to be a chore was an amazing delight. I was engaged and interested in the characters. I loved and hated Katniss so much, the conflicting feelings I had about her kept me on edge and made me care about what was going on with her.  You knew, yet you didn't know how this story was going to end, I can't really explain it but you think you know, and you are partly right, but you just don't know.  I loved this book from beginning to end and I can't wait to read the next one.
Great plot! Like Brave New World in 1931 and 1984 in 1949, The Hunger Games is the dystopia of its age. Government is overarching and oppressive (of course, how else can an overarching government behave?). Private enterprise is gone, a despised relic of past democracies. Children are not valued. Unless a person or a prize or an act accrues to President Snow's personal benefit, it's insurrection. The wealth is all spread around--among the Capitol's inhabitants, leaving only a paltry equal share for everybody else.  Another reviewer complained about Collins' style, meaning sentence structure. While I also stumbled over a few obstructions in the prose, I also stumbled frequently over Aldous Huxley's prose. This isn't a prose poem. Read Wordsworth if you're looking for long poetry. But The Hunger Games is a page-turner with a message.
I have been hearing about The Hunger Games for a long time and finally got it for my Kindle. I read it in one sitting. While the plot is a version of King's The Running Man, Collins gives it her own twist and enhances it with strong, well-written characters. We see the story through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl living in the farthest district from the Capitol of a post-apocalyptic United States. I was put off at first by the limits of the first-person, present tense narration; however, Collins does an amazing job of developing all the characters through the lens of her heroine. The intense action and powerful emotions had me alternating between biting my nails and tearing up throughout the book. I do caution readers, young ones especially, that some of the scenes are brutal.
This was an incredible book. I don't even find the right words for it. It was so desperate and the only thing that matters is to survive. There is no space for hope. Teenagers forced to kill each other in order to survive is just so cruel and although you hope for the MC to survive - somehow you cannot put aback what that means for all the other ones forced into a game of survival.  I felt hopeless when reading this book, it was packed with emotions and in the end, the twist and turn ( well positioned within the story) made it even worse. Whenever you think you can start to breath again the next thing happens that leaves you again gasping for air.  Only because of the brutality of the plot I would give it less than 5 stars, but only because I normally cannot read such books, but I made an exception here and it was well worth it!
I knew nothing about The Hunger Games until the movie came out. I was wondering what all the fuss was about, so I checked the Kindle store and thought for five bucks even if I don't like it I won't be out too much. It was worth every penny. Even if you have seen the movie (especially if you have seen the movie) you should read this book. The story is much more layered in the book than in the movie. I was up until the wee hours of the morning reading, and as soon as I got done I loaned it to my Mom, who loved it as well. Engrossing from beginning to end. I have read all three books in the series (I love my Kindle because as soon as I got done with the second one at a little past midnight I got to immediately buy the third and start in on it). I must say this one is the best, as originals often are, but all are woth the time and money.
I normally wouldn't take the time to review a book that already has thousands of reviews. It's sort of a waste of my time. BUT rarely does a book come along that is so good - I'll make it short and sweet because this book deserves every review it gets. Rarely does a story come along, written for the youth audience, as good as this one is. If you read only one (well three since this is a trilegy) book this year or even in this lifetime, I would have to recommend this trilegy. Simply put - I think this trilegy will end up in the classics category. And besides that, it is simply excellent and I have nothing to add or subtract from these wonderful, well-written books. Read them. Unless you were born under a rock, you won't regret it. Just be sure to read them over a long weekend or on vacation. You might have trouble putting them down.
I thought "Hunger Games" was targeted towards older girls.  For this reason I was surprised by how gritty, violent, and unromantic the story is.  I admired Collins' courage in making Katniss (the protagonist) pretty unlikable.  In some ways, she is the traditional hero: brave, moral, and focused.  At moments, she is unapologetically heartless.  She goes against gender stereotypse far beyond the point at which is cool.  I found her fascinating.  The story is simple (and possibly stolen), but it is intense and easy to read.  I finished the book in about three sittings.  At the same time, I had no interest in continuing the series.  "Hunger Games" does everything a story is supposed to do and ends (almost) cleanly.  If you don't feel like committing yourself to a series, don't let that stop you from reading the first book.
I started the book expecting to stop when the violence started and then go see Peeta in the movie. However I was unable to put the book down.  The writing was amazing and played out in my head like a movie!  The beginning where the author sets up Katniss's world which is so dark and dank captivated me. And then she gradually builds up to the hunger games violence with layers of great characters, past histories, and a Katniss's need to survive while staying true to doing the right thing.  OHH AND THE LOVE TRIANGLE!  Honestly Twilight has nothing on the Katniss, Peeta, and Gale trio in this book!  I finished this book quickly and then moved on to books two and three.  I love them all!  I love the movies too. They do a great job capturing the stories essence without deviating from the plot or characters.
I read this book more or less in a day because I couldn't put it down.  I wasn't too sure if I'd enjoy a YA title, but I'm so glad I didn't let that label stop me.  I won't give another description of the actual story, but I'll tell you how this book made me feel.  Once I was done, I missed the characters, which says alot about the writer's skill in making me care.  Being a title for YA also shows this writer's talent.  I couldn't be more drawn into the action, pulled into the romance, concerned about the outcomes, moved to emotion all while making sure the tone was appropriate for the target audience.  This will be the first book that I pass along to my 12-year old, one that we'll equally enjoy, because I feel she's going to love it as much as I.  I'm so glad that the second book is already out and I don't have to wait.
to be honest, I picked up this book because of the over hyped Hunger Games that is playing in cinemas not so long ago. But after reading a couple of pages, I am totally hooked. And I bought the Catching Fire &amp; MockingJay straight away. This novel blasted me off to my wild imagination, one of the best utopia style novel that I read so far..  The story is fast pacing right from the very first page.. it is full of action and details. It has successfully drowned me into the story. The plot is excellent, the world details is superb! I love it, Love it love it so much. It gives me a very enjoyable read.  I have to say the story is PG, not too dark but twisted with a very good surprise. Love the way Suzzane Collins wrote it.  Highly recommended!  Hunger Games, may the odds be in your favour!!
Very seldom do I read a book that I just can not put down. This is one of those books!!  I admit that I watched the movie first, then I got around to reading this trilogy on my kindle. Once I started turning the pages,  it was very difficult to put it down. I either got distracted by something else needing my attention, or my eyes will not stay open any longer! I breezed through this book in just under a week, and I am normally a very slow reader. (Taking roughly a month or more to read a similar sized book.)  Once I finished the book, I waited two days before starting on the second book. In the first two or three days I read almost half the book (at work). When I got home, I stayed up until the book was done....10 and half hours later!!!  I have just started the last book. Each one is riveting!
This book has taken my kids 13 &amp; 14 yrs old from hating books to carrying one around with them EVERYWHERE they go! At first it was ' The Hunger Games' series (which they each read twice), onto many other genres. The Hunger Games introduced them to characters that they could relate to, it made them cry with compassion, scream out loud, pray for blessings, smile &amp; laugh. It made them want to look into politics and our government. Reading just the first book took our family comfortably into conversations that I am not sure we could have had otherwise! My son went to bed holding this book and woke up early to try and get a couple pages in before school. If I threatened to take it away from my daughter, she would do ANY chore she was asked.  If you are looking for a book that will keep you up all night, this is the one!!!!
My friends were all excited to be going to see the movie premier and were shocked and scandalized that I had not yet read the books so I borrowed it from a friend and began reading it while they all went to see the movie. I have to say, I could not put it down. I felt an instant connection to Katniss and the other characters in the book and I found my self laughing out loud when Katniss showed up the judges, feeling Peeta's inadequacy, crying at the loss of Rue. It sucks you in at the start and doesn't ever let up. This book teaches you about prejudice, survival, love, sacrifice and being a hero to the one who loves you the best. It instantly became one of my top 10 in regards to book series and I have been reading it to my kids. If you haven't read it yet, if you are on the fence, take the chance. You won't regret it.
I had to write a review because I loved this book so much! It's definitely a page turner and it gets so exciting that I literally had to keep calming myself down to be able to read it. I'm thrilled I bought it as I was a bit wary thinking it would be really gruesome but it was so good! The only negative I would say is that the main character has it quite easy considering the horrific situation she's placed in. If I was her I'd consider suicide, running away etc but she's so grown up with it and yet she's a child. I also feel that her win in the arena isn't well deserved. I feel that she didn't have to go through much to get there, especially since she only physically killed one person. The writer could of played with my emotions a lot more, but I still loved it.  I'm recommending it to family and friends xx
Suzanne Collins knows how to craft a story.  It's easy to lose yourself while reading, "The Hunger Games," because the story flows so well. The settings are rich and full of just enough detail to form the image in your head, but not so much as to bore you. The characters are pretty well rounded, and this is one of the first books I've read in a while that features a very strong female lead bound not by love of a boy, but by family ties; something not seen often enough these days.  "The Hunger Games," is written for a young adult audience and as such there is a little teen love going on, so don't buy this book for your children if you're opposed to teenagers kissing.  Don't go to see the movie before you read the book! Both are fantastic, but you'll regret not reading this wonderful book.
In this first book of the Hunger Games series, readers are introduced to Katniss, a strong-willed girl from the country of Panem.  Her world is changed forever when she's selected to be a tribute for the 74th Hunger Games-a battle-to-the-death between 24 of the country's youth.  The story is told from the first-person perspective of Katniss in the present tense, which is a bit jarring at first but will quickly add to the urgency of the story's telling.  I bought only the first book at first, unsure if I would like it or if it would be too violent or disturbing (children killing children) but Collins does such a great job creating a world that makes sense-captivating the readers and not adding too much detail for the squeamish.  Do yourself a favor and get the whole set-The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay.
I finished the book and curious to know how the revolution and the romances will resolve so will try to finish the other two sequels for myself. But here are my peeves and won't be recommending to any teens:  1. The rule changes in the middle and end of the games. totally contrived.  2. The meanderings of the characters within the arena with total confusion of layouts or whereabouts. Four times Katniss circled back to the same spot by the stream. The timing and distance totally blurred to the point of boredom. Pacing was poor here.  3. the constant obsessive references to food and preparations of food. I get it already because it's the 'Hunger games' but they do not help build the story, plot or characters. Wasted pages.  4. characters were killed off too conveniently: Rue, Fox-Face, Thresh without regards or story. I thought this was lazy plotting. Why have 24 characters if you only want to tell of 6 (Katniss, Peeta, Rue, Thresh, Foxfaxe and Cato). Maybe it's to do with a YA book and the editors forced cuts in gore. But plot is important and so is the description. Author should have gone all out in creativity (take JK Rowling) and not hold back because it's for teens. That's a disservice to the genre and smack of commercialization. Please stop this.  5. were the parts that katniss was frequently naked in front of Cinna just to titulate the male audience? She's 16, that's creepy!  6. The telling in the present tense through only katniss's eyes totally limited the creativity. Would have loved to experience Peeta's, Rue's and other characters. Wasted.  7. The idea that the 12 tribes of about 8000 people each can sustain a capitol of that grandeur is totally unrealistic from all perpectives bearing resources are scarce. 100K is like a small US town supporting NYC.  8. Ages 12-18 thrown in the gladiatorial arena against each other is unfair, unjust, inhuman, babaric and brutally unneccessary. It's totally contrived because that happens to be the reading age these books are targeted to.  9. The horrors of the totalitarian regime and the killings are not properly explored as would be required given the premise of the story.  Some how I think the movie might be better because while the idea here is good (even that I heard was taken from somewhere else), the execution (no pun intended) was mediocre to poor.  Parents: Teens should not be exposed to these manipulative ideas and imageries unless you intend to conduct a thorough examination afterwards.
I probably would never have read "The Hunger Games", except 2 female friends (both 30yr+ soccer-mom types) gushingly poured accolades all over the story and one lent me her copy.  "The Hunger Games" is not a waste of time.  The "arena" action (Chapters 11 through 25) is a fun read and does seem to have that "Lord of the Flies" child-versus-child violence and machinations.  With fleshed-out dialog, those chapters could easily hold-up as a short-story or novella.  However, my stumbling block with "The Hunger Games" is the rest of it, chapters 1-10 and 26-27.  Which includes that anti-climactic, rushed, non-flavored ending.  Maybe more is revealed about the Capitol culture, psychology, and economics in the sequels, BUT AS A STAND-ALONE STORY I couldn't "buy-in" to why this advanced government (with hovercraft, night-vision glasses, sky projections, genetically-altered wasps and wolves, etc.) and their affluent populace (living in sartorial and couture splendor, with skyscrapers shining at night as if it were a summer's day, rapid transit, and food and medicine for all) would (after 74 years) continue to tolerate the gratuitous murder of 12 year-old children.  Tolerating the ritualistic murder of children would only make sense if the Capitol government and its citizens were:  1) unsophisticated and despotic (like warlords in Sierra Leone or Somalia, which force children to be soldiers and assassins); and/or,  2) truly abhorred and disgusted by the traitorous District citizens.  But even though The Hunger Games were created after insurrection and war (to punish and remind the Districts of their treason), and even though the District citizens are subjected to public whippings and spot executions, the Capitol citizens don't seem to be too sickened with these "traitors".  Quite the contrary, the Capitol seems to spare no expense when lavishing luxuries, food, parades, and interviews on these "tributes", treating them like A-list celebrities and rock-stars.  Rome (much less Somalia and Sierra Leone) didn't even come close to treating it's conquered slaves-who-became-gladiators to this much front-end comfort and indulgence.  Not economical, and not reasonable.  The story is written in linear, first-person narrative.  So, I don't think anyone should be surprised or spoiled in guessing whose perspective will be the final and living perspective.  Although, (SPOILER FOLLOWS), the story could (or maybe should) have ended by Katniss actually eating the poison berries (with or without Peeta), and dying as a martyr.  Unfortunately, it would have ended just as if "Romeo and Juliet" had been told from Juliet's perspective and we could then never learn (like "Romeo and Juliet") that "The Hunger Games" could (and should) indeed be a cautionary tale.  We could never learn that it was the characters' martyrdom that compelled the Capitol (like the Capulets and Montagues) to end the irrational and uncivilized Hunger Games and to start governing it's District citizens with civility.  Instead, "The Hunger Games" has a contrived and weak ending.  Of course, that would require the author to be more pragmatic and add more depth, fleshing-out the cardboard supporting cast, the Capitol's politics and sociology, and even some detail as to the arena's mechanics.  How the parachutes are delivered with such precision, how the weather is changed (Katniss seems to think they can change the weather), the infinite network of cameras and microphones, etc.  "How do you think Haymitch did it?"... "He outsmarted them."  Really?  That's all we get of Haymitch's Hunger Games?  You still know nothing about his Hunger Games strategy and survival... the mini-story of his own morality.  He's made out to be the bumbling, town drunk, but NOT the post-traumatic syndrome drunk, the "yes, after all these years it's the Hunger Games that is killing me" drunk.  What a waste of an essential character that could reveal the nature and brutality of the games through profound dialog and edgy character interaction.  Instead the author chooses uninspriing, one-dimensional, one paragraph narrative, buried in the monotony.  And maybe things do get fleshed-out in the sequels, but... again... as a stand-alone story, "The Hunger Games" falls short in that respect.  Unfortunately, I think this type of all-inclusive exposition is a bit outside the author's scope or ability, and therein lies the difference between a teen-novel and adult literary fiction.  If you are an adult, and a science-fiction fan like myself, and looking for the depth and exposition of contemporary authors like Stephen Baxter, Greg Bear, Orson Scott Card, etc... you will not find it in "The Hunger Games".  Or, if you are a looking for the nuance and post-apocalyptic poetic darkness of something like McCarthy's "The Road" or Atwood's dystopian classic "The Handmaid's Tale"... sorry, also not in "The Hunger Games".  So, from now on, everytime I see and hear 30+ year-old adults pour accolades on young-adult fiction, I will feel like the Danny Glover character in the Lethal Weapon movie series, "I'm too old for this $....!"  Thank you
I'm a senior in high school. Each year, my cousin (who is a children's &amp; young adult librarian) sends me a list of books she thinks I should read. Since freshman year, EVERY YEAR she put The Hunger Games on the list.. EVERY YEAR I ignored it.. I just wasn't into the "fantasy" genre, though this book isn't a fantasy. I want to say it's a "utopian" genre, but it's not really that either. I'm more into books that can realistically happen in this time period.  It wasn't until my best friend, who has remarkably similar taste in books as me, told me I *NEEDED* to read The Hunger Games, that I decided to give it a try. I've been hooked ever since, and I can't wait to see the movie March 23rd!  The characters are well-developed and the whole idea of the book is incredibly unique. I recommend this book to everyone I know.
I stumbled upon this book in my search for novels that feature strong heroines, Katniss fits the bill (at least in this book). The author does an incredible job building a world so different and yet so similar to our own, you can easily see it being the future of our very own country. It's thought provoking on many levels and enticing. I couldn't put it down and finished it in less then 24 hours, it made me eager for more at the turn of every page. This is probably one of my favorite books of all time now! I will say the rest of the trilogy, especially the ending, is a bit disappointing. After this first book I had my hopes so high for the rest of the books but was left a bit disheartened to say the least. Never the less, this first book was a stroke of brilliance and I will be eager to see the movies take on it.
Suzanne Collins' did a really masterful job crafting a post-apocalyptic tale geared toward teens that is every bit good enough to hold up to adult approval.  In "The Hunger Games" we are introduced to a 16 year old, plucky, protagonist - Katniss and her tale of survival as she is placed in the spotlight fighting for life in a Reality TV'esque survival show.  Collins does a great job placing Katniss in a plethora of creatively cruel situations and how our heroinne overcomes them makes for a great brisk read that will surprise you at how fast you're turning the pages.  While the overall tone of this book borders on 'pulpy,' if you enjoy such near sci-fi, dystopic settings not to mention some great action set pieces "The Hunger Games" makes for an entertaining read.  Perfect actually for a summertime beach read!
It is not often that I don't love the main character and yet feel so attached to her.  In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is strong, intelligent individual and sometimes that is somewhat off-putting.  But in her world, there is no room for sentimental feelings.  She is a survivor for herself and for her family.  I found the story fascinating and compelling.  I turned the page faster and faster as I read on, desperate to find out how the story would end.  The characters are believable.  The only thing I did not enjoy was the writing style.  To me, it was choppy and difficult to read at times.  I found myself reading one sentence three times before I understood the meaning.  I would have rated the book 4.5 stars, but since I couldn't, I rounded up.  Overall, I thought it was quite brilliant!
The only reason I read this book was so I could get dragged to the movie, and to possibly understand what all the *squee Katniss* hype was all about.  About a third of the way into the book, I was ready to not read the next one. This book didn't live up to any of what I perceived as hype about it.  For a supposedly violent book, there was surprisingly little of it. Okay, there were a couple of graphic scenes, but they were few and far between.  For a strong female lead, she spent a good amount of time generally being non-participatory in the story. (Here we see Katniss hiding in a tree... And now she's hunting for food... And now she's hiding in a cave...etc)  For a book about the Hunger Games, there was a whole lot of Hunger and very little Games. (See above two points.)
"Exciting" is the best word I can use to describe this book.  I could not put it down until I finished it.  Don't let the fact that it is technically a "young adult" novel deter you.  As a 20-something who dislikes young adult fiction, I was hesitant to read this book.  However, once I started, I couldn't stop.  Though the prose is a little juvenile and choppy (e.g. the characters say exactly what they are thinking/doing), the overall theme and story is exciting enough to keep anyone of any age hooked.  Just a warning, the book is all about violence and teenagers being forced to kill each other to survive.  There are also some graphic descriptions at certain points (though tame compared to today's standards), so be wary if you are letting a child read this.  Overall, great book that I would recommend to anyone.
If you watched the movie and thought it was okay, read the book, it is brilliant. the movie barely touches on the plot. Don't get me wrong, I think the actors were pretty and did okay - and personally I love Donald Sutherland. he's got the sexiest voice. if I could have him as my satnav voice i'd be forever in my car driving around - but I feel the movie would have been truer to the book if it were handled by Peter Jackson of "lord of the rings" fame who did a brilliant book to movie adaption. in the movie, it looked although Peeta was faking his feelings to get through the games. the book was far better. when I finished reading this book, I went straight to amazon and bought the other two books and was not disappointed in the whole trilogy. can't wait to read it again... and again... and again...
I think I was one of the last people to jump on the "Hunger Games" train. I heard mixed reviews and didn't want to waste time on books I thought sounded boring. I also heard the end of the saga was less than awesome. I finally gave in after being dragged to the first movie. Once I picked them up I read all three in three days! I couldn't put them down and I was literally upset there were only 3! They are some of the best books I think I have ever read. They have a wonderful story line, beautifully painted characters, I love the love story/triangle dynamic. I had heard the ending of the trilogy was terrible, which was a huge reason it took me so long to read them. I disagree fully. The end was perfect, maybe a little short. I think it was wrapped up in about 2 pages, so abrupt, yes, but absolutely perfect!
Was in my break room at work when I saw this book being read by one of my co-workers. They said it was absolutely amazing and I figured I'd give it a try since the title looked engaging. Sure enough! I got home and I downloaded it straight to my Kindle and read through the night. In 2 days I finished this amazing and well written book and in a week I finished the whole series. For the next month this series was in my head. I just couldnt stop thinking about the characters and the plot and how if at all possible it could have gotten anymore interesting. Unfortunately I see that Hollywood couldnt keep their greedy little paws off it, and soon the ignorant masses will be swarming to see this in theatres. But good for those of us who have read it- it cant be ruined in our minds, and will remain a great book!
Having read this as a man in his mid 20s, mostly on a whim, I wasn't expecting to be enthralled by what I suspected to be a book written for teenage tomboys. I was wrong.  OK, I wasn't wrong about it being aimed at teenage tomboys with a penchant for a bit of teen romance, but that's a relatively small part of the story that just creeps in in bits and pieces. Really, this is a great action novel that tackles themes that most authors wouldn't attempt to tackle when writing for young adults. Not only that, but it tackles these themes in a very effective and easy-to-read manner.  The Hunger Games may not find a permanent place on my top bookshelf, but I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for an intelligent action novel, and anyone looking to find out what the kids are reading about today!
The Hunger Games is a dystopian novel about a girl named Katniss who in order to save her young sister Primrose from certain demise volunteers to compete in the 74th annual Hunger Games. This event is held each year to demonstrate the capitol's power over the twelve districts by choosing two tributes from each district to fight to the death for fame and wealth. Katniss is from district 12 where a tribute has not won for decades.  What could have been another adequate and typical story about rebellion and an unfair government is exciting and fresh in author Suzanne Collins' hands. Her protagonist Katniss is highly developed and her storytelling is top notch. Each moment is important for moving the story along which keeps the reader engaged at all times. I couldn't wait to read the second book.
I admit, I did not read or see this movie when it was popular. I couldn't get over  the premise of kids killing each other. I assumed it took place in an arena with fans cheering them on to the death, like in roman times when they battled barbarically in arenas. It seemed so awful  I couldn't believe everyone was infatuated with this story. In 2014, I finally watched the movie. I was entranced, it was so good! I watched all three and then decided to read the books expecting tons more 'background' details. There is a little bit more info in the books than the movies, but what surprised me the most was how extremely close to the book the movie actually was! Usually that's not the case. The book was written really well and it was super good. Not gory , like I expected the story to be. It was really good.
I admit when I picked up this book it was just for my book club and I didn't even care that there were two other books in the series.  A quarter into the book and it became really good and I enjoyed reading.  After about half way, I could read the book while on the elliptical and not even notice I was working out.  The last night I read it, I read almost 4 hours straight just to finish it and once I was done i dropped it on the ground.  I was upset because now I needed to get the other two books!  A good story that is very suspenseful and makes you look at our society a litte different.  It definately has characters you can connect to and shows some morals and values.  I thought it was a great book, I heard a rumor of a movie, and I am ordering the 2nd book tonight so I can't wait for all of it!
I bought this book because it was really cheap on Kindle in the months preceding the movie release. I ended up blowing through all three books in less than a month - and that's with working full time and taking care of a family and household. I started reading it expecting it to be tween-level fiction. It wasn't. Not every adult will like it, but it was a solid story with interesting characters and an actual meaning that adults and teens alike can appreciate. It's not like Twilight and other teen-targeted fiction that is filled with self-absorbed characters. The characters are very much fighting for a worthy cause. It's about the chasm between the haves and the have-nots, with a corrupt government making sure that gap does not close. So essentially it's an allegory about [insert country name here].
Overall, my favorite book series has been the Hunger Games. Suzanne Collins takes you to Panem, a country that emerged out of war. There are 12 districts  no, as during the Dark Ages, 13 was destroyed for rebelling against the evil Capitol. The Capitol wants to make the districts sorry that they ever rebelled, so they put up the Hunger Games. Districts 1-12  must send in one male and female tribute to fight to death on live TV. And only one tribute can get out alive for the Capitol's amusement. Join Katniss Everdeen, who has been determined to feed her mother and sister, Prim. Who she is fiercely protective of. And it's Prim's first year in the Reaping. District twelve hasn't had a winner since the 50 Hunger Games. The 74th Hunger Games tribute is...Primrose Everdeen. The Hunger Games have begun...
I bought this book for my tablet and read it in about 3 days.  Its a new spin on the future of the human race.  The people are oppressed but there is no lack of human spirit.  The main character, Katniss, is a fighter who has overcome many obstacles in her short life.  While Katniss is indifferent and skeptical the other main character in the book, Peeta, is charismatic and warm.  You fall in love with him immediately.  I enjoyed each and every character in the book and the descriptions of everything, right down to the clothing, was amazing.  The author's creativity with the futuristic aspects were intriguing.  I loved reading Katniss' thought processes and made me think about my own survivor instincts while she was struggling through the games.  You become the biggest fan and hunger for a victory!
With nearly two thousand reviews posted, (all of which I have not read) I find that a lengthy exposition of this story is not needed.  It is wonderfully written, (First Person, Present Tense takes getting used to at first) and compelling in storyline and characters.  I found only one flaw, from my perspective, in the whole plot: young Katniss, the protagonist, has a bit of an advanced vocabulary for a sixteen year old, uneducated girl from what was once a poor mining community.  In First Person Present, we only hear the voice and thoughs of the primary character, hence the entirety of the author's writing needs to be attributed to Katniss Everdeen, the main character.  Very enjoyable read and I followed immediately (as did thousands of others) with the next two books in the series.  Gordon Ryan
I want to start off by saying this, i love this book!!!!! i first read this book for a book report last year. i remember the times when i absolutly had to put the book down, when i ate, when i slept, and during school i felt a longing to read more. now as i read it again a year later i feel the same way...like i just have to finish it. i can compare this only to when i started reading harry potter. very few things give me that feeling and the ones that do usally stick with me.  Another thing about this book is the characters. suzanne collins makes it so easy to fall in love with characters after just one page. this book is one that will fill you with a need for more. it will make you laugh,cry,and really feel for the characters.  so if your looking for a quick good read the hunger games is a must
I am 51 and I liked the Hunger Games, though I know it is written for teens. It is the best of the trilogy, be warned. I did also like Catching Fire. Mockingjay, the 3rd book, was more disappointing. There are obvious flaws in the trilogy, like Katniss seeming to go through a personality change unrelated to the story (the games). It comes off as a error in the writing and I personally would have rather seen her come out as a stronger female character in the end. Other flaws seemed to be the author's limited imagination, it is hard to see a future where there are hovercraft and cures for major injuries, yet a coal mine is still a necessity. I'm not saying I didn't like the book. I did think it was a good idea for a book, just maybe could have been more continuity, worked out the inconsistencies.
From cover to cover you are entertained by the complax personality of Katniss and her struggle to find herself while taking care of everyone she loves. As her situation becomes harder she confuses herself with all of the parts she needs to play not only for her own survival, but for her own emotional well-being. It is one of the best books I have read and it also left me questioning what I would do, given the same situations. There are so many intertwined themes and topics that intermingled as well. Society vs. the individual good, the role of the media, the impact of fashion, governments role and controls, and the individual family unit. There is no clear cut black and white, good or bad, this book lives in the gray area and that is why it is so compelling. I'm so excited about the next two!
I was excited to read Hunger Games because the plot was intriguing. North America is split into fenced off districts with little food and a large number of people dying of hunger. Outside the districts there are supposed to be dangerous creatures. They were mentioned off and on and never really explained. I'm assuming they are genetic hybrids/mutations of animals. Each year the government selects one boy and one girl from each of the 12 districts and sends them to the wilderness to kill each other. The survivor's district gets a little more food for the next year. I enjoyed learning about all of this in part one of the book, I enjoyed the preparations for the games, and watching Katniss fend for herself in part two of the book. Unfortunately, around part three things get stale. Katniss spends most of her time sitting around thinking, not really in any danger. Her companion from district 12 is whiny and a bit irritating, but I don't blame him for what happens in the end (no spoilers). It's hard to really like Katniss, she is scrappy and tough, which is commendable and understandable, but I never got much more than that out of her. She can be petty and immature, as is expected from someone her age, but again I don't see more than that. She lacks a bit of depth. The romance is pretty bad and the ending was abrupt, but predictable. Truthfully, we expect the main character to win the games. How could this be a first person series if she didn't? I guess I expected more than a Man Vs. Wild episode, but that's what this book felt like. I was bored various times, and didn't enjoy the ending of the novel at all. Hunger Games didn't live up to all the hype for me.
I loved this book.  I finally caved into the pressure of the hype, since everyone is obsessed with the film's release. I figured that it wouldn't do any harm to give this book a shot, despite my usual disappointment with overly publicized books.  With all that said, I couldn't put this down. I quickly found myself emotionally invested in certain characters, cheering for them to survive. I loved that Katniss had no real romance triangle like so many YA books do lately. I loved the amount of violence and action that had my heart racing. I loved the overwhelming sense of sadness and haunting that carried through this novel. Did I mention that I loved this book?  The book ended too quickly, but I am eager to read the next installment of this enthralling story.
I finally read this book after the 10th person mentioned to me how great it was.  I was reluctant because it didn't sound like my genre, not really one into futuristic or fantasy books.  Didn't get into the twilight at all or harry potter either.  I'm older than the target ago group, etc.  And I was skeptical could it really be that good, but I was pleasantly surprised. The writing is great and you instantly care for these characters and want to find out what happens to them.  Some bits were a bit out there for me (not to give things away but some of the creatures that attack were a little weird to me) but as a whole the book was quite well done and couldn't wait to read books 2 and 3.  They were all good, although the 3rd one was a little bit of a let down. Books 1 and 2 were awesome.
This book is amazing, and I would like to recommend this book to everyone, but it is a little gory so it is not for kids
I had to read this to see what the hype was about.  For teens or tweens I can see why they love it.  As an adult reader I immediately caught on the nods to the the short story The Lottery, the TV show Survivor and the classic film Gladiator.  Most young people wont see the connection. Still the Hunger Games creates a dystopic world where the US has been divided into districts that produce food and resources for the Capitol.  Residents of the Capitol live a carefree life of ease while the distrcts face starvation and a yearly ritual where two young people from each district  are forced to fight to the death for the Capitol's amusement.  The young girl from District 12 proves to be a survivor and there is some puppy love thrown in.  Read it as it will keep the attention of young and old
When I read a book I want to escape. The book has to be compelling enough to take me to another realm and return me feeling as though I have been on a vacation. This is one such book. I am dying for the second installment. Set in a modern day tech society there are 12 districts suffering under the weight of the "Capitol". The government is quick to take out anyone or district who stands against them. They do not like to be mocked. Hence the demise of the once district 13. As a reminder of who holds the power the capitol instituted an annual game of sport between the competing districts ending with one victor out of 24. Katniss, the leading lady, has been training for this her whole life without ever realizing the days out in the wild hunting would one day save her life. Great book.
i dont like reading books but this was a book. i could not it  put down. it had action humor and romance. the book is about this girl who's father dies in a coal mining accident and illegaly hunts to stay alive in the county of panem in the ruins of north america. there are 12 districts in the country. every year as payback for a rebellion the capitol makes 2 tributes one boy one girl to go to an arena to battle to the death which is broad cast on live TV for every one to watch. the main character is not in luck when her younger sister is choosen to go into the games. she throws her little sister back and volunteers to go to the games for her. i thought the first 50 pages of the book were a little slow but after that it got really good. i would recommend this book to every one.
Read all the books even got my husband to read them. We went to both of the movies and looking forward to the next one.
I saw this book on the top 10 amazon kindle for a very long time, but every time I read the summary of the book I thought it would be too science fiction for my liking.  Just this past Saturday I made my move to read it and I was captivated from the beginning.  I could have spent all Saturday reading this book, but as a mother of a 4 year old other priorities took precedence.  Either way I finished reading it on Monday - the flow was non stop, and action kept coming.  Even though it is about kids fighting against each to the death  , the story focus on survival.  The main charatcter - she is a thinker and brave, you can't help but like her.  This is going to become one of my highly recommended books to all.  If you have been hesitating read it - I can't wait to read book 2.
As a 47 year old male, I'm probably not the typical target audience for this book.  My daughter has mentioned it and I thought I would review it before I allowed her to read it.  I think maybe she needs to be a little older first.  However, none of that stopped me from enjoying the book immensely.  I guess I had expected something maybe a little juvenile or sappy and was very surprised instead. The story is very fast paced and the action is rather vivid.  The violence is presented in a very matter of fact way rather than glorified. Katniss is more mature than her age but considering her environment and role growing up it is very believable.  The first person narrative took a bit of getting used to but then I mostly read non-fiction and historical fiction. I will read the next.
As a grown man it's been decades since I cried while reading a book, which is why I love and hate this book for making me mourn for a FICTIONAL character! Catching Fire (next in the series) was good (4 stars), but Mockingjay (last in the series) was a let down, especially due to the anti-climatic ending and also because of the senseless death of anyone dear to the protagonist...and to the reader.  Parental review: I let my 12 year-old daughter read this book after I read it, but rather than be crushed or dismayed by what happened throughout the story, she seemed a bit oblivious, almost as if it were over her head. I'm pretty sure I would not let &lt;13 read the next book, and definitely not the last one in the series, with each sequel becoming more morbid than the last one.
I have heard so much about this book that I was finally able to read it. Beyond being totally brutal I felt like some chapters I had to hurry up and read just to get through it. I enjoyed the book but there were a lot of slow parts. Reading this book you do start to grow a hate for the "Capitol". It is unfair how they treat these children and the children literally have no say. Once I started comparing this book to reality and seeing it in a 3-Dimensional state, it really is amazing and sadly true. I guess the reason I didn't like some of the parts is because I didn't want to admit that the world can really be that ugly. Great comparisons in a "fictional world"! Also a great choice if you liked the Harry Potter or Twilight series and are looking for a new series to read!
Totally great book. I got the first book for free with amazon prime. I read it in 1 day because I just couldn't put it down. This book really isn't just for young adults I am a father and absolutely thought this book was great. When i finished this book first thing the next morning I bought the second book. In the end I read the trilogy in just 3 days because I really could not bring myself to put it down. It is a little gory at times for younger readers, and some other content like the twisted people in the Capitol is a little offensive to some people. Overall it was a great book and I loved that Collins kept to the story in the 3rd book and didn't ruin the series by making it some sappy teen love story.  I can't wait to see if the movie(s) can come close to the books.
After fighting against reading the book for weeks I finally gave in and to my surprise I LOVED IT!!! The book was all but boring. There was a ton or diversity and the way that Mrs Collins had so many characters that were completely different but at the same time so much alike. Everytime you thought you knew what was going to happen there would be a twist. Just when you thought it was all over something would change. It was an emotional and suspenseful book full of details and excitement.  Katniss seems to be a character that you love and hate all at the same time. There are so many conflicting thoughts and emotions when dealing with the her and the other characters of this book. In my opinon it is a fascinating way to entertain and keep your readers on their toes!!
I read this book in about a week.  It was an entertaining read and had a cool idea behind it, but overall the writing wasn't my favorite.  It was a lot of description, and talking about the action scenes in the book which made it sort of dry.  I would have liked it if the author had made the story feel more personal between characters and if it had been less about the action scenes and describing them.  It was however an entertaining read and the size of the book was perfect for a slow read throughout the week.  I've seen the movie and i think it did the book justice, the action scenes played out better on screen than they did in writing in my opinion.  I thought that it had a good premise and the life-and-death struggle made it exciting, but the writing was average.
I chose HG after an avid reader told me she couldn't put the trilogy down.  This book started very slow and continued to be slow and redundant, until the last 20ish pages.  But... having said that... I zipped through the entire trilogy in 3 days.  Once I was finished with HG, I could not stop until I had read the entire series.  And I'm glad I did.  Many other reviewers praise it more eloquently than I.  But what I wanted most to do, was encourage everyone to stick with it.  The themes are worth conversation.  To me, this is the anti-twilight in that the protagonist doesn't sit around pining for her true love.  She is a hard worker, hunting and providing for her family, and can kill when necessary.  I'm thrilled to have found a non-gender-specific book for tweens.
When this book was forced on me by a friend I was nervous it was going to be some dreadful twitard rubbish so I ignored it for as long as I could before I finally succumbed to her incessant wheedling and read it. From the first page I didn't come up for air until I finished it. The Hunger games were a bit reminiscent of Battle Royale, Mad Max, The Road and even Vampire Hunter D. Yet very much it's own unique story. If you're a fan of semi-post apocalyptic sci-fi you'll have a hard time putting this book down. If you weren't previously a fan of the genre this book might just be the one to change your mind. Extremely easy to read, moves at a smooth exciting pace. Suzanne Collins creates a vivid and terrifying future that it is easy to imagine awaits us all. Yikes!
So much has been said and written about this series of books, and that is a good thing. It is more than an easy to read YA fiction series, it should prompt real discussion about what can happen in a society where the haves and have nots are caught in a relationship that only benefits one party. The movies are awesome as well, but if you are a fan of the movies, you owe it to yourself to read the books and delve even deeper into Collin's post-apocalyptic world where children prey on each other in front of a whole nation as a way to entertain and in some ways enslave. Deep stuff to think about; it takes reality TV to its extreme, and I think we can all recognize the possibility that something like this is not impossible in a detached, entertainment hungry society.
The Hunger Games is definitely a novel with a brilliant concept and a somewhat frightening view of what could happen if a government has complete and utter control over its citizens. However, I don't think I would have missed much by not reading this book. Katniss is a horrible protagonist. Period. From somewhat early on in the book, I knew that I didn't care for her, but as the novel progressed, I came to despise her. I can't quite put my finger on why without giving away the book, so that is all I will say about it for now. Suzanne Collins gave me a main character that I hate and a book that could have been so much more. I'm giving it three stars because the concept is cool, and if the main character was not so unlikable, I probably would have loved this book.
Im Evelyn and Im ten years of age. When I first heard of the Hunger Games I had no idea what is was about...just the fact that it is extremely famous.    I have read all 3 books and I loved them to death. The way Collins writes its astounding..she makes you care for the characters.    This serious belongs on the same line as Harry Potter..in my case the best series ever made. I am a writer and you need to realize how hard it is to find an idea as brilliant. Thats why I love it so much.    I wish I could comment alot on the characters..like The Star Crossed Lovers From District 12. Peeta and Katniss seem like a great couple..but surprises happen.    .SPOILER.  Sort of how Peeta strangled Katniss in the 3rd book. No one could of expected that.
This book is awesome:) so is the movie:) so is Suzanne Collins:) she's an awesome writer:) i really love this book:)
I was talked into reading this book by my 12 year old son. I told him that I wouldn't watch the movie until after I read the book. Needless to say, I delayed to long, and he and my wife wound up seeing the movie together. It wasn't until I saw the preview for Catching Fire while at the movies to see Superman, that my interest was renewed in the saga.  Overall, I would highly recommend this book. It was definitely written as a book geared towards teenagers, and there were parts that were just way too far fetched for my liking. I'd say that's it's really hard for me to give a completely objective review given the fact that I know that there was another one coming and knew in advance about the development of the core characters.  Definitely worth the read.
I've been hearing many good things about The Hunger Games so I decided to have a look, and after a couple of days I couldn't put it down. This dystopian thriller about a group of teenagers battling to the death in an arena where there is only one victor was tense enough until I realized I was reading about my very own worst nightmare. Honestly. Being trapped in an enclosed space and having to kill or be killed with random painful weapons has been a recurring dream of mine since childhood.  It's a good thing that memory didn't keep me from enjoying the story which is well constructed with good character development. This is the first book in a three-part series and I'm looking forward to finding out what eventually happens to Katniss Everdeen and company.
I found Hunger Games to be an engaging read, I don't read a lot of YA material and this was a pleasant surprise. Ms Collins created a fairly simple and easy to follow distutopian society that is like 21st century United States more than people will be comfortable with. That's a plus in my book. The pacing and details regarding survival, suffering, food, physical trauma etc will be startling to most people in the YA crowd  Saying that, Some of the concepts were kind of over the top and simplistic. The name of the nation, "Panem" for example which derives from "panem et circenses," "bread and Games" seems a little harsh.  Otherwise and finally, it was an enjoyable read,I'm looking forward to seeing the movie, and reading the other books.
and THAT is what I look for in books, expecially Trilogy's.  I prefer to read series or trilogy's after most or all of the books are out.  I read pretty fast and feel as if I might knaw my fingernails out waiting for the next book!  I am so glad that I waited until all the books are out for this read.  A nice change from some of the other books but still included what I like most: Adventure, danger and intrigue!  As for the romantic part about it - I liked how the author really took the time to portray the 2 different sides to the emotions.  Wonderful to see that even while your characters are fighting for their lives, literally! Just finished this today and I have loaded the next 2 books into my kindle and CAN'T WAIT to sit down later and start book 2!
Recommended by one of my favorite authors, I was hoping it would as good as she says it was - IT WAS EVEN BETTER!! I am so glad I read this at a time when the following 2 books were available. I burned through Hunger Games in 1 day - it was that good. It's very rare, at least for me, to have a book move me, the story staying with me way after I've read the last page. There was a little bit of everything - mystery/suspense, a love story, politics, action and humor in just the right places. The setting is on the dark side, but fitting for the futuristic storyline. I love how the plot was constantly moving and changed just when I thought it wouldn't - kept me on my toes and glued to story. I dove right into book #2.  I would highly recommend this book!!
I compare the book a little bit to "Enders Game" since in both kids are separated from their parents and siblings and both have to face the struggles of survival in an unfriendly and hostile environment.  I loved the hunger games for it's detailed description of not only the characters but the world itself. The characters are not overdeveloped but relatable enough to care about them. And the environment has a dismal feeling about it that I last felt when reading "Lord of the rings" and Forod's time crossing Mordor.  If you like mild SiFi, love well developed environments for the characters and like to be kept on the edge of your seat I can really recommend this book (trilogy).  Have a good (reading) time  René
i have recently decided to start reading contemporary young adult (till this day i didn't find any title interesting) and borrowed this from a friend.  i have to admit that i liked it. it's a fine, entertaining book, though it did not leave me impressed enough to read the rest (especially when now i know how the story ends), but i may read the sequels sometime later.  Frankly, i did not like Katniss, but there were other interesting characters and their fates kept me interested. After i read Hunger Games book 1, I watched the movie and liked it, too. as i said, both the book and the movie are entertaining. i won't call this a deep or haunting story, but it does not pretend to be one. Pure entertainment, and i liked it for what it was.
Let me start out by saying that I didn't like the Twilight Trilogy. The books were awful and the movies were even worse. And yet, I still felt a pang of envy every time I saw someone get excited over Twilight. I wanted to be able to share in that excitement. I wanted to be excited about a trilogy like these people were. Well now, I am! The Hunger Games is a fantastic book. I read it in one night, didn't sleep at all, and I'm still so happy. I've just started on the second book of the series, Catching Fire, and I'm loving that one as well. I'm so happy to be able to be excited about a Trilogy. I'm excited about the Hunger Games movies to come out. I'm just plan excited about this book. Thank you, Suzanne Collins, for reviving my literary soul!
My best advice to those who haven't yet read the HUNGER GAMES is to buy the trilogy before you start reading.  I absolutely guarantee that once you've finished the first book, you will be scrambling to get your hands on the second and third books as fast as you can.  I have read this book three times and enjoyed it almost as much as the first time.  Not only is the story concept incredible, Suzanne Collins writing skills are what really make these books sing.  And Collins has got Katniss in hot water at every turn, so you can't help but burn through the pages like a hungry kid at the snack bar.  All I can say is I wish there were a way for Suzanne to have kept the HG series going in perpetuity because I'm said to have finished them already.
The hunger games, the first book in the series, is a great and addicting read. From the very first page I was enthralled with the style of writing and how interesting district 12 was. The book itself is around 300 pages, but it is a very fast read because it is just so addicting and is what I like to call a page turner, you'll find yourself wanting to read chapter after chapter because you want to know what happens to the main character(s). The story is told from the narrative of Katniss, the main character, and we get to see the world of Panam and District 12 through her eyes. This a book I would highly recommend, it's a cross between 1984 and running man. Very fun, but brutal, and you will care about the characters by the end of the book.
I read this book for two purposes--I teach 7th grade and several students were reading it and on the recommendation of a friend.  IT was fabulous!  I could not put it down!  It had me anxious to go to the next page at every turn of the book.  it is well written, (certainly on a level that adults would read also).  I loved the character developments and the suspense.  I would tell anyone that likes to read to read it quickly--before the movie arrives in March.  I knew this was part of a trilogy so I had ordered all 3 books.  Book two is just as good and picks up exactly where book one ended.  I also give it rave reviews.  The third book (not quite done with it yet) is not as good of a read but I will wait to comment till i have finished it.
I really enjoyed this book.  It has many of the hallmarks I look for in a book: engaging characters, interesting plot and most importantly, it makes you think long after you've set the book down.  That said, I would not recommend this book for kids.  The moral/ethical issues raised in this book left me (a 31 year old) thinking and dreaming about the book for several nights.  Obviously, it's a parent's decision what their child should read, but I highly recommend reading it yourself before deciding whether you add it to your child's reading list.  The good news is an adult is very likely to enjoy it.  The premise of characters between the ages of 12 and 18 being forced to fight to death in order to survive is not for the faint of heart.
I have to add to the chorus of admirers for this terse, vivid, finely drawn story. The gritty Katniss character has already leapt into immortality, seemingly overnight, even before the film, which I watched a year before I picked up the book. I wondered if I would be disappointed. Written in a spare prose with an economy that is Hemingwayesque (in a good way), I found myself engrossed in this skillfully paced saga. Is it a thriller? An allegory? A coming-of-age story? A Herculean myth, or a social critique, set in a dystopic future? A feminist-Boadicea-warrior-princess saga? I couldn't decide. But as someone who wrote a dense, heavily researched nonfiction book about a famous painting stolen by the Nazis, I found this smart book riveting.
I was just like Stephen King, I couldn't stop reading!  There is so much in this short novel, its stunning.  Katniss is an amazing character, who definitely has her faults but whom you can't help rooting for.  She is the typical American rebellion, but also picks her battles. Her main focus is survival for herself and her sister.  Love doesn't seem to even occur to her until very late in the game.  I loved the realism in this, I think the "tributes" (contestants) are very realistic, and if you threw 24 teenagers into a pit and told them the last man standing is the winner, the events in the book wouldn't be far off!  At times sick and sadistic, and other times hopeful and heartwarming, I definitely recommend this read!  5 stars from me!
I don't know why but from a couple things I saw I never thought this would be the type of story I would like.  Then it seem like all I heard was people talking about it and how good it was and they were excited about and they were excited about the third movie coming out.  I finished a book I was reading on my kindle and I thought what the heck I will download this book and see what all the hub bub is about. Oh man it is wonderful.  I couldn't stop reading it. I flew through the book and am not on the second looking forward to the third so I can go see the movies.  I may be a little late . Way behind others but I am so glad I decided to check it out.  It is one of the best books I have ever read.  I am so glad I didn't miss out on this.
All I can say is wow! After struggling through Narnia, I needed something that was a bit of a quicker read, and wasn't disappointed with The Hunger Games. I tore through it in about a day and a half. It also kept me awake long after I put it down last night. It has moments of terrible death and murder, along with sweet moments and acts of heroism. I struggle a bit with it being called a kid's book. Collins didn't pull many punches when it came to killing off little kids, but she sure kept me glued to the pages. And of course this is the first in a series, so I have to immediately jump into the next one because she left an awful lot of questions unanswered. The Hunger Games easily stands as one of my top reads for the past six months.
I resisted being drawn into this series for a while, but I saw the movie when it came out, loved it, bought the book, and loved it.  Many reviews already talk about the plot and really unless you've been living under a rock you know people are being killed in The Hunger Games.  Nevertheless, why I like this book is that it's pretty original, has a very strong heroine who not only tries to fight for what's right but also struggles with the concept of what is right, and has a fast paced story-line and well-constructed world by Suzanne Collins.  I love this series, can't wait for the next movie to come out, and would definitely recommend buying The Hunger Games if you're hesitating over whether it's worth it or not.  Because it is.
this is not typically my genre of choice... AT ALL.  but i overheard someone speaking about MOCKINGJAY and it peaked my interest.  upon investigation, i found out that THE HUNGER GAMES was the first of a trilogy, borrowed it from a friend, and after the first few pages, i had difficulty putting it down.  it reminds me of a cross between shirley jackson's THE LOTTERY, the popular t.v. series LOST, and william golding's  LORD OF THE FLIES.  it is a clever story that makes you think beyond the last page.  and having stumbled upon this so late, it is sheer joy that i do not have to wait another year for the next book to come out.  i have already started.  just another life lesson... try something new.  you never know until you try it!
Wow. I was absolutely blown away with this book. I could not put it down -- literally; I read the whole novel in one sitting.  Collins successfully draws out the most human elements in every situation portrayed in the book. Everything comes across easily and vividly. The characters, setting, story, message -- every facet of the work is magnificent.  Though not an arduous read (and I was at first skeptical because of how easily I breezed through the pages), The Hunger Games is an engrossing tale wrapped around a profound commentary about society.  I highly suggest picking up this book.  PS The hardcover has a beautiful embossing of a mockingjay on the front, which was a nice surprised. I am a big fan of fine-looking books.
I really enjoyed this book. I began reading it after seeing the first movie because I kept hearing from others how much better the books were then the movies. They were definitely right. Don't get me wrong, I love the movies. But the books give so much more  description and detail that the  movies didn't and couldn't possibly capture in the short time allowed. I can't wait to continue reading the next book and then the third.  I have to say that while I really liked Katniss's character, my favorite by the end was Peeta. And it broke my heart when he realized that her feelings for him were an act. I will be reading the next two books in hopes that she realizes what a great guy he is and hopefully returns his feelings.
I decided to buy the book after seeing the theatrical trailer for the movie. Now I'm not sure if I'll even go see it in the cinema. Don't get me wrong - the book is amazing - but I'm afraid whatever they put on screen won't be able to measure up to it.  The storyline is amazing, but I'm not sure if the pacing would translate well into a movie. The same goes for the in-depth character development. How can you really communicate the background story of the main characters in some trailer-driven 90 minutes?  Suzanne Collins is without doubt a unique and talented writer, bringing some fresh wind through the genre with the start of this trilogy. If there's one thing to criticize though it's the naming choices. Minor point though.
Before reading this book I had a handful of people tell me how good this book was and how they couldn't put it down once they began reading it and if you have people telling you the same thing TRUST them...there were nights I had only a few hours of sleep b/c I could not put it down.  I love it when you start reading a book and you don't want to put it down and at the same time don't want to finish it b/c you want it to never end.  This book grabbed me from the first chapter and from then until the last sentence it was sweet satisfaction.  I am about to download Catching Fire b/c I cannot wait until Monday to borrow it from the same person that lent me The Hunger Games...I.WANT.IT.NOW.  ENJOY!!  You will not be disappointed.
I noticed the novel to be well crafted having a wonderful pacing. There may be a lot of physical violence within, however, not so ostentatious they can be drawing attention. Romantic scenarios are generally sparingly created so they won't end up being way too embarassing (one thing I tremendously treasured as a father!!) The rage versus the program theme is definitely common enough to get noticable, yet not as overbearing as they point out...  On the whole, My partner and I strongly recommend this particular book for the children from 12 up. The conclusion turns me to think that this is going to be a series. I actually imagine I will probably be pre-ordering the moment it really is accessible. Congratulation Ms. Collins!!
as a kid i thought it would be good because everybody at my school was raving about it and i couldn't help but try it left me crying for an hour when people i connected to got hurt and died but i think that it might be a little to emotional and sad. now i thought it was awesome but when you think about it it's pretty sad and i wouldn't  recomend it for kids until they're older because it's hard to deal with that people you love or know die i couldn't deal with the fact about a lot of people die. i thought it was happy that the lovebirds made it back but a lot of other's died.  it should have an equal part of makeup for the sad part.  so the kids that read this should be prepared for the people who die.
This book is easy to read and the story is original, and captivating from the first page to the end... and of course makes you want to read the next book.  The characters, and the environement where the story takes place is very well described. It seems real enough. I like how the author doesn't take the readers for fools, I was surprised by some of the events in this book. Of course some of it is predictable but still leaves me want to know more. I already recommended this book to all of my friends and have purchased the next one.  On a sidenote, I am very excited for the movie coming out in march 2012... hopefully the book will be well reflected.  I already like the choice of actors so I think I wont be disapointed.
There are no words to describe this book! No way to capture just how amazing it is.  This book is so unlike anything else I have read, it is so powerful and gripping and incredible in every sense of the word.  Katniss truly is the girl on fire. She is powerful and strong and a survivor. I admire her so much (even though she can be annoyingly dense at times)  This book had me crying, gasping, and gaping in amazement. I could not put it down!  Peeta is adorable, and I want to punch Katniss for how dense she is and hurting him at the end. I cannot wait to see how their relationship develops in the next book.  This book makes you think, and you get lost in its world. Suzanne collins paints such a detailed picture. I just finished the book and I want to pick it right back up and start it over again. That is how much I am in love with the hunger games.
I was, I must admit, skeptical from the very beginning. I'm not usually one into the latest things and only eventually read the Hunger Games after picking it up at the library.  Forget twilight, forget Harry Potter. It's the Hunger Games all the way!  Maybe the reason I'm drawn to this book so much is that it's actually, in it's own way, relatable. These are humans who have had their own share of suffering, their own consequences of war. Our history is woven into this book.  Thus, I'm very drawn to these characters, and it's almost as if they are tactile. And while the author's actual writing style is not fleshed out, her story is!  I'm looking forwards to the movie and reading the rest of the series.
I read this largely based on the number of five star reviews.  I also read it because other reviews said that while it did fall into the "youth" or "young adult" genre, older adults would enjoy it too.  The concept of the story was entertaining enough, but as others have pointed out, pretty brutal, teenagers forced into a competition where they're forced to kill or be killed.  I did not, however, find the actual death passages to be overly grotesque.  Still, in my opinion this is definitely a book that will appeal much more to younger readers than more adult, mature readers.  While it was a well told story, I personally found the writing to be a bit simplistic, and doubt that I'll be reading the rest of the trilogy.
I thought this book was great, it kept me up at night thinking about society and how we act, and having different parts of the book pop in my head and refuse to get out.  One interviewer said something about the 'reality tv' idea not lasting and therefore dating this book, especially once those shows are no longer on our televisions but if you've read Futuretrack Five Futuretrack 5by Robert Westall which was written about 25 years ago (I read is as a child and have a copy still) which had a similar reality tv game you realise that this book will become a classic too.  If you love this then read Futuretrack Five, it's an excellent book too with some similar themes but maybe a little less bloody.
What can I say that other have not already said? The book is dark, brutal and full of action and intrigue. The characters are rich and alive, the setting is vividly depicted and the pacing is excellent. If you love dystopian settings, this book and series should be a perfect fit for you.  Don't let the "teen" label scare adults away. While it may be easy reading, it isn't dumbed down to a point that you feel your more mature senses are offended. It is written in a simple style but it's also a great story-telling style as well. Adults may even love this one more than the kids and I think this book will go down as an all-time classic. It will be read in classes of ages to come as an example of a great book.
I must say I only turned to The Hunger Games because the Harry Potter series has come to an end. I know many people will be feeling the same way so I wanted to recommend the Hunger Games as an amazing next read. The first book was so additive, I made it through all three in a fortnight!  From a female perspective I enjoyed having someone I could relate to as the main character and being able to hear the thought process of Katniss made the books so more enticing.  From my perspective I can tell the quality of a book by its ability to pull me in to it. When reading The Hunger Games I am there, in the games, which is why I think The Hunger Games Trilogy is a MUST read for anyone who is looking for an escape.
After several different recommendations, I finally picked up "The Hunger Games." It has been many years since I've been so swept up in a book that I read it as I'm commuting to work and even walking down the road, but this book had me absolutely mesmerized. The tempo is bang-on, with racing speed and pensive lingering in all the right places. I immediately took a liking to Katniss: strong, independent and flawed. Peeta, while a bit flatter, was charming enough that he grew on me. The plot itself is familiar (maybe even a little played out, if you read a lot of sci fi), but the pacing, the characters and the little flourishes of unique detail made it something special. Overall, an easy, enjoyable and intense read.
The Hunger Games grips you right from the beginning. It's like your right there the undeveloped feelings that Katniss had for Gale. Katniss has feelings for Gale and thinks that Peeta is playing his feelings for Katniss in order to win and gain sponsers in the game. The tension and the action are throughout the story it is nonstop.  I recommend this book to all of my friends, and this is definatly a book for both boys and girls. The romance in here is not so overwhelming that it makes you gag it is present but it is just enough. And the action is unbelievable throughout the story it's like your right next to them fighting.  I can' wait to read the rest of the series and hope that everyone else reads it to!!!!
I was desperate to get my twelve year old into reading but she refused every 'tweenage' book I got her. I bought this book as a last ditch effort and it was a winner!  We both thoroughly enjoyed the imaginative plot and the character development. It started out a bit slowly but then the action started to build and didn't stop until the last page.  As I always do, I encouraged my daughter to read the book before watching the movie and for once she did and agreed that the movie was not as satisfying as reading the book.  I have since recommended this book to several friends and colleagues and they have all enjoyed it. I would definitely check out some more of this author's work in the future.
I borrowed this for free so i figured i could see what all the fuss was about without risking anything, and i honestly thought it would be another one of those oversold and overrated flavor of the month kind of things, nothing i would get into.  WRONG!! I found myself lost in a world that can only be described as blunt, hard but not begging for simpathy.The charictors are so deep and, unlike most books, i couldent even compare them to anyone im my life. it was hard to put this book down and when i did all i could think about was what would happen next, how long i would last if it was me in there. i highly recommend this, even if you dont usually agree with the trends. This book will make an impact on you.
I'm not much for lengthy reviews.  it was a good book, it entertained, I'm 44 yrs old and still enjoyed it...and i hate teenagers!!!  Anyway, the only thing wrong with it is that it was in kindle format only on the e-book format.  the story is told in 1st person narrrative from a sixteen year old girl's perspective in a post apocalyptic version of a North America that has been split into 13 districts that all are forced to provide for the "capitol" district.  As punishment for one of the 13 districts rebelling 75 years ago, the hunger games were created to entertain the capitol residents and to remind the other districts who is in control.  Teenagers will love this book.  As do many adults I suppose.
Let me begin be saying that I read this book before of any news about a movie being in production, however, if I were to have read it now, a week before the book is set to be released in theaters, I would think that the hype is still not enough. I have read this book, series actually, several times. I cannot seem to put it down. It is excellent not only for YA readers, but also for adults. I like that it is not a sappy love story even though it is and I love that a male would be as much interested in it as what a female would, even thought the lead character is a female. Please take the time to read this book if you haven't; I assure that the only disappointment that you will find is that the story is over.
I didn't truly know what this book was going to be about, but it was bought for me and I read it. I loved the amount of descriptions in it that really sucked me into the story, wanting to read what happened next. It is a story about a girl named Katniss who lives in District 12, a coal miner part of the country. Each year there are games between the districts where kids between 12-18 are chosen to fight each other to the death. Katniss will be entering these games along with Peeta, a fellow student who is a baker's son. Throughout the book we learn a lot about survival and love. It is quite interesting! I read this book a few years before the movie came out by the way (Yes, book is better than the film).
I bought this book not really knowing what to expect.  It was on my long list of books to read, and I needed something else for my morning commute, and it was less than $10 for the kindle, so why not?  I could not be more pleased with how surprised I was with how great this book is! I was hooked very quickly, found myself pulling out the kindle to read even while standing up on the train, and got through it in about 4 days, which is pretty impressive since I only have the option to read while on the train, and often don't bother pulling out the kindle.  But for this book, I did, and immediately bought the 2nd book, Catching Fire, and can't put that one down either!  Great book, great characters, read it!
Everyone I spoke to who had read these books enjoyed them so much that I had to see for myself what the fuss was all about.  I started by borrowing The Hunger Games from a friend, in case I didn't like them as well as they all seemed to.  After only a few chapters, I was hooked!  I purchased all three books in the series for my Kindle and read them straight through till I was done!  Loved them!!  I highly recommend the series to anyone who enjoys futuristic, young adult adventure.  Even though I'm way past that age group, I could relate to a lot of the story re:  family, friends, loved ones, and fighting for what's right.  Great job by Suzanne Collins.  I look forward to reading more from this author.
I closed the book, found my car keys, and drove to Barnes &amp; Noble to buy the second part of this trilogy. I couldn't wait for Amazon Prime's two-day shipping; I needed to start the sequel sooner than that.  I had hardly put the book down by the time my wife picked it up. She stayed up until 1 reading it. She loves it. I'm not sure that I'll finish the second book soon enough for her.  Yes, The Hunger Games is in the young adult genre -- Amazon recommends it for Grade 7 and up. Yes, I felt judgmental eyes wondering at my choice in literature as I read on the train. But yes, you will enjoy this book.  Don't assume the popularity is a passing fad. Ms. Collins has written a fantastic tale for all ages.
For all the people complaining about it being too disturbing...congratulations on reading a book that's not sugarcoated sunshine.  If a book makes you think, it's done it's job well.  As for being too graphic for YA, I have to disagree there as well...none of the deaths cash on in "gore factor" but at the same time capture the sheer brutality of the Games the characters find themselves in.  I felt like this book worked perfectly to set up the setting for the post-apocalyptic world and for the sequels to follow.  I'm eager to find out what happens on a larger politic scale, and follow the characters I'm now invested in as the plots thickens, as it were.  Highly recommend, to YA and adult audiences.
I believe this book was very well written.  I loved finishing each chapter and wanting to go to the next just to see what would happen.  I would find myself never being able to put down the book, which usually never happens.  I choose this rating because i honestly couldn't find one thing i did not like about this novel.  The author wrote the main character, Katniss, very beautifully and i love how you can watch her develope the deeper you get into the novel.  I would highly recommend to read this before you see the movie if you have not.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good science fiction novel with a plot twist at the end. Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor!
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, hardcover   Imagine growing up in an environment that suspects you to be enslaved and happy about it, an environment that might send a child off to die for other's amusement. The story starts out in a small poor village. The main character is a 16 old girl that is single handedly supporting her family. The tension begins when she explains The Hunger Games and how the system forces one boy and one girl to enter in to the Games, to fight to the death for the capital's amusement. These fights are not unlike the gladiators' but with children. This book is griping. A climactic story line, you will be glued to the story to the end.  Mrs. Sage's Class  Samuel
When it was announced that Jennifer Lawrence would be starring in the movie franchise, I immediately downloaded "The Hunger Games" to my kindle. I fell in love with Lawrence after seeing "Winter's Bone" at the theater. Plus, I'd heard great things about this "Battle Royale"-style book. For a young adult novel, it's surprisingly well written, and I was hooked from the opening chapter. I found Katniss Everdeen to be a compelling, complex character who is deeply flawed and all the more interesting for it. Easily great surface entertainment, I also like the deeper themes the novel introduces: class warfare; suffering as entertainment - this is the epitome of extreme reality TV; personal integrity.
I'm reading this trilogy while recovering from an accident. The story line is engaging throughout with a good amount of imagery. I really appreciate a strong female lead who's worth is not defined by whether or not she finds love. She is often conflicted between doing the right thing and self-preservation, as we all our in our lives. Even the silly superficial characters are given compassionate depth that reminds us that each of us are fighting our own battles. All in all, the writing is well-rounded from the plot lines to character depth and development. The films have been done well but reading the books gives a much deeper perspective that will keep you thinking long after the last page.
I heard Rosie O'Donnell mention this book on her show and just had to look into it.  After ordering the book I had second thoughts about my being too old to read it and planned on giving it to my Granddaughter.  When it arrived I just thought I would take a look at the first few pages.  Once I started reading this book I just could not put it down.  My chores didn't get done on time, I stayed up late and just never wanted to put this book down.  I was afraid it was going to be too violent but I was wrong.  I was very pleased that it had such a strong female as the main character.  I can't say enough good things about this book and how well written it is.  After telling my Granddaughter about it (she being 13-I am 70) she is waiting patiently to get it in her hands.  I purchased all three books but have to force myself not to start the second just yet as I know that once I start it nothing else will get done.  Thank you Ms Collins for such a wonderful read.
i dont remember how long it took me to read, but i do remember hardly getting sleep because i would stay up literally all night and read Hunger Games. And when i finished, i couldnt stop thinking about it. It didnt take long to fall in love with the  characters. Katniss and Peeta's relationship was cute and romantic though there were some twists. Hunger Games is also VERY thrilling. Suzanne Collins has a wild imagination. Her writing really makes you feel like you're there. i kept thinking to myself "Would i survive in the hunger games?" this book made me laugh, cry, think, go "aww!", and put me on the edge of my seat. i cant wait til Catching Fire the movie comes out :)
One of the best books I have read in a very, very long time. I would recomend reading the whole series.
I love this book so much! I love mystery books so i didn't know what to except fom this book.  In the begining I thought Peeta was kind of stuck up, but in the middle of the book he seemed really nice, loving and supportive. What I'm getting at is that you never predict what is going to happen ( unless you have seen the movie!).  Also I think this is a good book for people who like books with romance. Katniss seems to have feeling for Peeta but something happens. READ THE  BOOK TO FIND OUT!!!   It felt like I could never put it down. There was never a boring part and was a page turner for sure. I would recomend this book for anyone how loves action, suspence, and romance.
I realize every five star reviewer says something like, "Oh, I couldn't put it down," which, I suppose is sort of the nature of what gets five stars most times, but I really mean it, as in literally mean it, when I say, "I couldn't put it down." I read this straight through in one day, which I just never have time to do with books anymore. Yes, it's written for teens, so, yes, that makes it a super fast read--and no, I'm not a teenager, but that doesn't take a way from the fact it's just darn good story-telling. To hold the age group it was targeted for against it as it stands among other books would be akin to holding a hummingbird's size against it as it stands among other birds.
When beginning this book, you quickly realize that it is one that you cannot easily put down. It is a very fast-paced, intriguing, read that one can finish in a short time period. I have read all three books in the trilogy, and I was very impressed. I have read some reviews that state that these books are flawed in some ways. My only statement in reference to that would be that all books are somewhat flawed; however, the flaws do not stand out at all in this series. My only complaint in this series, and its not much of one, was that the ending of the trilogy was less that desirable (for me at least). But even with the lack luster ending, the series is definitely worth reading.
The Hunger Games was a fantastic read.  I loved it both times that I had read it.  The Hunger Games really appeals to all age groups and demographics.  It contains a great mix of romance, action, drama and science-fiction.  Also, I think the book has many insightful analogies to todays international relations.  For example, the Capitol appears to dominate over many over places just like the U.S. does today.  The characters in the novel are all very developed and appear human to me.  I feel real pain and sadness whenever a tribute dies in the book.  Overall, I think that The Hunger Games would be a great book for anybody and that its definitely deserving of its success.
I just finished book 1 of The Hunger Games, and I have to say that it blew me away. I was kind of cautious about it because it sounds weird right? poverty, corrupt government, and  sacrifices???? Seriously? Well, trust me it is about SOOOOO much more! I won't spoil it, but it weaves a amazing tale about courage, friendship, and love. The writing is amazing and personally I think it is one of the best books I ever have read. I was addicted, and after I finished it.... I was numb and thinking, "how could this be over?!?!" I cannot wait to get the next books and see the movie, which comes out August 18. Amazing book. I totally recomend it.    Olivia B. -age 12
After hearing all the talk about the Hunger Games, I was thinking, okay here comes another Twilight, made for teenagers with a catchy romance and some action.  Numerous times I heard, "You've got to read the Hunger Games."  Finally, hearing my cousin, who hasn't read a book since he got out of college, say HE couldn't put them down, I was curious.  So, curiosity got the best of me and I started reading.  This book got me from the get go.  It has some bigger themes at play for those who really want to get into it.  Now, I'm almost done with the second book.. the first one got me hooked and I'll be definitely reading the whole series.  I honestly couldn't put it down.
"The Hunger Games" was one of the best books i have ever read. It was exciting, filled with action, drama and intensity. "The Hunger Games" is a book about a girl named katniss who is very brave. She, along with the kids in her district 12, from 12 to 18 are entered in "The Hunger Games". This is the 73rd annual games. Every year one boy and one girl get picked from each district and they fight to the death in the capitol. All the districts watch "The Hunger Games" on television and hope their district wins. Whichever district wins gets an extra supply of food so there is alot on the line,including lives. Now go out and read this amazing book and see what happens.
In The Hunger Games, Collins creates a wonderful read that transcends the pages of the book and leaves you begging to know what happens next. I would highly recommend the entire series since I could not put these books down. You'll be up at night losing sleep so I would suggest reading this book on the weekend or on vacation! I borrowed the book originally and had to buy my own copy because I had to read it again. The story and the characters will stick with you long after you turn the last page.  The only word of caution I have is that due to the nature of the subject of the book, it is graphic at times and may not be appropriate for young or squeamish readers.
Katniss has had to grow up very fast--she volunteered to take her sister's place in the Games, and then had to survive....  Katniss is a strong lead character. The reader is privy to her thoughts, thereby allowing the reader to have a front seat view into the numerous twists, turns, and strategies that last even up the last moments of the Games.  I know that some reviewers summarize the actions depicted in the books. In this case, while I'm tempted to revisit the story, I don't want to deprive the reader of the suspense, the action, and the surprises that I experienced while reading The Hunger Games.  The bottom line: READ THIS BOOK!
The author really has a way with her words. The book came recommended to me from a friend in our book club and while I was hesitant because I heard it had some disturbing parts I decided to try it. I could not put it down once I started. I think it will make a great choice for book clubs and bring alot of nice discussion and feelings to the table.  With it being geared for the young adult I think some parents may seem it a bit brutal and distrubing. However, what are country is facing in real life these days is much more than this. Take the time to read and if you have a young adult child it may make for a great conversation and a great time well spent with them.
I absolutely ADORE this book. Everything about it is so harsh, so greuling, and so gratifying. Definitely a distopia, the book is the most compelling thing I have read in YEARS! My heart actually hurt when I put down MOCKINGJAY, the third book in the trilogy. Anybody who has not read this book had better start, because once you're in, you'll be amazed at EVERYTHING in the book and wish you'd read it sooner! Suzanne Collins inspires me so much, as do Katniss and every other good character in the story :) I am an aspiring author, and my book is: Forever Amber Please check the H.G. and my story out :) Thanks for reading... BUY THE HUNGER GAMES!
I finally broke down and read the Hunger Games and I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised!! For starters, it was almost impossible to put it down--after a few pages, I was completely hooked. The characters were so real, the descriptions so vivid and the situations so compelling and dynamic, I almost wanted to stay up all night to finish it. The dramatic plot is brutal yet thrilling and just takes the fantasy genre to a new, gritty level. The thought of a post-apocalyptic world that leads to survivalist competitions is like a foray into a Darwin nightmare. Suzanne Collins made the concept believable and relatable, which is an amazing feat for an author.
I started out reading the first page of the book &amp; I was already hooked. I never read a lot of books because none of them really get me hooked right away. The Hunger Games was awesome! For me I actually enjoyed the second book the best. I did think that the last book started out a little slow but with the other two books I wasnt able to put them down so I knew it would pick up which it did. I only borrowed these books from a relative but I want to buy them so that way I can actually read them again! I am actually so amazed by them that I actually believe that any other books I may try to read may dissapoint me because I thought these books were so amazing!
I saw the movie before I read the book. The book is better in my opinion. Collins does a great job.
At first the idea of putting an arena full of children to fight each other until death seemed unfathomable, particularly as a book aimed as young adult reading.  But this book turned out to be much more than that.  It was a story of sacrifice, loyalty, determination, and love.  It wasn't all about the fighting and wasn't overly graphic and feel it would be liked by a variety of age groups.  It held my attention from the beginning and it was hard to put down.  I'm anxious to see the movie but I'm afraid some of the thoughts and emotions of the main character, Katniss, may be hard to portray through a movie.  Can't wait to read the next book in the series.
This book is just about perfect.  It has the right amount of heart, energy, and social commentary along with engaging characters and shudder-inducing violence that sends a clear message about human nature.  I'm late to the party, but I had to add my positive rating to this book as well.  Katniss is the kind of reluctant hero you want to cheer for, and the rest of the characters are brilliant - Peeta, Haymitch, Effie, Cinna Rue - they are all very well-written and you can't help but root for all of them too.  The 'games' themselves are hold-your-breath exciting and depressing at the same time.  Very well done - if you haven't read it yet, pick it up!
I knew this would be good, but... oh my good! I have no clue why I was hesitant on reading this at all. I would even go as far as to say that I am ashamed of myself for not reading it the moment I saw it.  I loved everything about the book. The characters were amazing, each and every one of them. The story was so intriguing because I feel that this could actually happen in the future with the direction our world is going. The love triangle wasn't very heavy in this book because there was no Gale, but as of yet, I am Team Peeta.  You need to get off this page and read this book now! And if you are a fan, we can eagerly await Mockingjay together!
I started reading this book several times, on the recommendation of friends and colleagues, but it didn't really grip me. Then it did, I couldn't put it down. The post apocalyptic society depicted is reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984 with technological updates; there is the huge gulf between the haves and have-nots, Big Brother in the form of the Capitol is (mostly) all seeing, propaganda is the only form of entertainment.  The characters are well drawn, their actions are believable as is the dialogue. My only criticism is that Katniss's moral considerations are perhaps overstated but the writing is never clumsy. Thank you, Suzanne Collins.
I agree with other reviewers that the basic premise of the book is a bit flawed, but it is very entertaining, although somewhat simple-minded. As I was reading I was yearning for something that would set my gears grinding, but most of the book is pretty much what it is without any additional themes, symbology, theories or subplots that would get you thinking, not enough substance for a second reading. The idea the writer focuses on is whether by surviving, are you giving up your identity/freedom. This was pretty much the only theme of the book. I disagree with other reviewers that didn't like the ending. I actually loved it because the last couple of lines of dialogue leave you thinking. However, this book is very reminiscent of Ender's Game, which in my opinion was much better. To all of those who hail this book as a masterpiece, I urge you to read Ender's Game and reconsider.
I waited a long time to purchase this book, but glad I did. The writer has a way, of taking mundane everyday things in life and making them interesting. The pace was a whirlwind, but I felt the story took to long to actually get to the arena. By the time she got off the train at the arena area, I felt the book could have moved forward at bit faster.I was most disappointed with the end. Not because of the end itself, but because, before I finished the book, I did a web search on the next books in the series and on that web-site the end to this book was given away. It did spoil the end for me since I already knew what was going to happen.
When I a book gets a lot of hype, I usually get skeptical. Can it really be that good? Well, I really enjoyed this book! The first person present tense narrative really made the story very immediate and pressing, and after a while I forgave the blatant fragment and run-on sentences as more lending to the realism of the herione's voice. No spoilers here: just a fun action packed book set in a twisted post-apocalyptic society (and really, what post-apocalyptic society is *not* going to be twisted, let's be honest) with interesting bit of ambivalent romance. Yes, some of the plot is predictable, but overall it was hard to put the book down!
All I can say is WOW!  I never used to read books for leisure, but this book has transformed me!  From the first moment, I could not put this book down.  I found myself turning off the TV in favor of this book which I have never done before.  The book starts out with a summary of Katniss Everdeen's life in the future country of Paneam's District 12.  Collins describes the Hunger Games which are actually a punishment to the citizens for revolting 74 years ago.  You can probably guess what happens next so I won't spoil it for you!  In all honesty, if you haven't read a book in a while, or simply want a good read; you need to buy this book!
I admit I was hesitant to read this. After being assured that I would love Twilight, only to find it a poorly written series with an annoying main character, I didn't figure this would be any better, no matter what people were saying. I was happy to discover that this first book of the series is very well written with interesting and sympathetic characters. The suspense holds up well throughout the book, and I even found myself getting a little misty eyed at one point, even though I knew what was going to happen from seeing the movie.  I will definitely be reading the other books in the series (I never finished the Twilight series!)
It took me a few weeks to read this book. Mostly because I couldn't even read the first chapter. But I forced myself to continue reading, even though I was slightly bored. And honestly - I was pretty bored up until chapter 9. I couldn't figure out why this book was rated so well.  Then it gets to the fun part: The Hunger Games... It was a very interesting read... And I will be excited to see the movie, because I think the movie will be more interesting, honestly... Once I started reading it (past chapter 1) I finished it in a day. Debating rather I want to buy book 2....  This review is coming from a 22 year old female, hope it helps :)
This book was such a refreshing departure from the typical fiction book.  I am SOOOO sick of crime novels, stories about jaded police officers and special agents, bla, bla, bla.  This was a well written story that really makes the reader think what they would do if they were in that same position.  The premise of the book sounds so morbid, and it is...until you get into the book and explore the depravity of man.  I can't wait to get into the next two books, I've heard they're not as good as the first but I'm sucked into the story now.  Most books bore me at some point in time, this one held my attention was a true page turner for me.
When I started reading reviews from this book, thought it was just another teen love story, and being in my early-30's, didn't feel was what I was looking for. But when I saw it was at the top of the list, decided to give it a try, and was completely with it. It's written in a way you can't stop reading, and being a story about teens, can be easily enjoyed by those who are looking for a fun and entertaining story. I have recommended the book to my students, finding a connection between the story and human rights, and they have liked the story so far, so it has been proved in different generations with success.  Fully recommended!
I haven't watched the movies yet. I feel it's always better to read first. I loved the detail in this book. Some of it I wish were more detailed- what happened to end the Americas and the rest of the world for that matter. But it describes all of the necessary story line and leaves the reader wondering why Katniss hasn't quite grasped how Peeta feels. On occasion, it's hard to think of how young most of the characters are, considering their situations in life and their personal experiences, but then you are reminded again of how young and innocent they truly are despite being thrust into perils and first love on national television.
Being a huge (past) fan of Twilight, when The Hunger Games came out I was like, "Oh great here we go again....". When the movie finally came on Netflix and I was up late with "nothing better to do", I watched the movie and fell in love. I immediately went on Amazon and bought all of the books. I know you should usually read the books before seeing the movies but I felt like it was pretty well done for the most part. I loved all the details that were in the book though and some of the characters that were left out. I cried when Rue was killed because there was so much more emotion to it than there was in the movie.
This was the first book I read on my Kindle.  My sister, an elementary school teacher, recommended it after reading it on recommendation.  I think this is one of those explosive books that by word of mouth is destined for greatness.  Katniss is what any young woman would like to model her courage, perseverance, and dedication on.  I know I wish I was more like her. Each chapter pushes you to keep reading the next chapter, and before you know it you're done with no sleep for that night.  I am glad it was optioned out for a movie, the author did such a fantastic job that I hope she makes loads of money on this one.  Great concept.
I've been hearing buzz about this book for quite some time. I heard the basic premise and thought it sounded awful. It finally reached the point where at least 10 separate people had recommended this book to me so I gave in. And... I finished it in a day. I couldn't put it down! The plot of the book (reality tv show featuring a brutal fight to the death) is very well thought out. It takes place in the future but the plot is realistic enough that it makes you think "could this ever happen here?" I don't want to give too much away but I will say if you enjoyed "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card you will definitely like this book.
I absolutely loved this book! Aside from the main character being a teenager, I would not have guessed it was part of the young adult genre. It did not have the cheesy, adolescent YA "feel" you sometimes get from novels geared towards YA. I was almost instantly and thoroughly engaged with a number of characters, and that did not change throughout the entire novel. The premise and storyline was unique, exciting, and emotionally-charged. I could hardly put it down and have already started the second book in the trilology. I love books that leave you dying to know the outcome of the characters and this one delivered on that front.
I hesitated reading it because I thought it sounded so morbid (that everyone but one person had to die).  Boy, am I glad I re-thought that one!!!!  This book was fantastic.  From the time Katniss took her sister's place in the games I was hooked. I held my breath with every break of a twig or anything that might mean that she was in trouble of being killed.  This was one of those books that you could not figure out what was coming next.  You think you know how the story will end but there are many twists that leaves you wondering what will be around the corner in the next chapter.  Would recommend to anyone regardless of age.
I'll be honest. I don't read books very often. I'm not what you would call a bookworm. I've bought countless numbers of them though, but none of them have caught my attention enough for me to make it past the first few chapters. I bought this book after reading all of the amazing reviews. I was hesitant, but I figured I might as well give it a shot. I am so glad I did! The characters are amazing and unique, the plot had me on the edge of my seat, and the world is so vivid I could picture it all in my mind as if I were seeing it all on a screen. I'm definitely going to buy the other three. I reccommend this book to everyone!
This is a good book in every way. As a teenage girl Katniss really stood her ground and held up strong for a lot of peculiar people that need to learn to do the same as Katniss. Though there was a killer movie to go with the book, the book totally overlapped the movie. The only thing I needed the movie for is to see the place describing American as Panam (if that's right). Once I seen the movie my picture that I created was totally wrong, so I am still willing to accept the movie. Ms. Collins well done on the imagination you have gave us, and your open mind shall lead you far in this creative world.  -15 year old
. . and very hard to please. I agree the story line is brutal. I initially struggled with where the story was going in the first book.  But being so engrossed in a book is what I live for - and these all did it!  I thought the characters were very colorful and not at all "flat", as some have commented. I like being surprised and not able to predict where a story is leading.  I was constantly surprised with all three of these books.  There's a reason The Hunger Games is a phenomenon; don't miss out on this engaging experience.  I'm so bummed there are only three books - and I pray the movies do them justice.  Amazing read!
I got this as a library book for my kindle. Science Fiction or futuristic books are usually not what I read.  But I got caught up in the story immediately, and downloaded after I read the sample.  I didn't realize it was a series, so when I got to the end I was surprised and a bit disappointed. I doubt I would have gotten it had I known it was to be continued.  However, I bought the second book and am well into that now. It's very visual, and I can actually see a lot of the characters and creatures in my mind's eye, even when not reading, especially the muttants, unfortunately.:)  Stays with a person. Very absorbing book.
The Hunger Games was absolutely captivating!  I read it in less than 24 hours, and the only reason it took so long is because I have motherly responsibilities... ha!  Suzanne Collins did a great job of immediately sucking me into the story, and I found myself surprised at the twists and turns more than once.  I generally steer away from anything that reeks of pop culture, and with the movie coming out in a few weeks, I really didn't want to read it.  However, a friend from high school recommended it, and after surviving two years of AP English together {over a decade ago!}, I trust her.  Especially after she compared it to The Giver (illustrated; gift edition)... Can't wait to read the next two books!
I felt this story was very well written, it was interesting and well detailed. I read all three books in less than a week, because I kept wanting to know what would happen next.  Times are tough when you grow up in the economically depressed District 12, where only real industry is coal mining. Starvation can lead to desperation and ingenuity. Action packed from the start Katniss becomes a partipant in the annual hunger games as one of the two District 12 representatives. A game in which 24 enter and only one leaves alive...  The story has fear, sacrifice, violence, love, and action... Anything more would spoil the fun.
I have not been absolutely consumed with a story for the longest time until I read this... I was excited, scared, happy, sad and enraged! Only a truly well crafted story is able to take me through all those emotions and keep my attention even while my family is in front of the tv.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan about was that the story was written in the present progressive... Call me old fashioned, but I would have preferred the past-tense... I can see why the author chose to write it the way she did, but my opinion remains. (But I'm extremely nit-picky).  Loved the story, though. Incredibly unique. I'm hooked. :)
This book was incredible.  The moment you start reading it you are intrigued.  I can not recall any part that I wanted to skip or thought it was boring or too descriptive.  Very good read! Awesome book!  I would have to say the only thing I don't like about getting the Kindle edition is that you don't get to read the back cover or preview of the book first.  Have to go to the Amazon.com website and look it up. Not like a book you can look in the front cover or the back cover for a brief synopsis of the book.  That said this book was absolutely amazing and I had a hard time putting it down.  Great read for all ages!
This book has a great plot, good characters who develop throughout the story, and a satisfying conclusion that still leaves you wanting to know more.  The plot reminded me of Orwell or Bradbury, believable and terrifying.  It is something that I certainly hope never comes close to the truth in the future, but you still believe it could, and wind up asking yourself, what if it did.  The story is touching, funny, thrilling and completely engaging.  It is coming out as a movie soon.  I hope Hollywood can do it justice!  Do yourself a favor and click "buy," but be ready for an "I just couldn't put it down" experience.
This is a great book! When I read a book I look for a plot that keeps me guessing, keeps me awake at night because I have to finish it, and a story that makes me want to read more.  The Hunger Games was that book.  Not because of the movie or hype (which is due!), but because the story is fast paced, you connect with the character, and it has something for everyone.  Slightly tragic, a little romance, tons of action, a little political thrill (which comes up even more later in the series), and a great futuristic feel.  It is Orwell's 1984 meets Gladiator.  The Hunger Games is a great read that I highly recommend.
I found this book almost impossible to put down once it got going.  Everything about this book is interesting and compelling.  I think I would classify this book as an action/adventure book, but with a little bit of politics and romance thrown in to keep it interesting.  As a guy that doesn't read romance books, I was nervous that the romantic plot was going to overtake the book but it didn't, it was just the right amount to keep it interesting.  I was surprised to see this listed as a children's book because some of the violence did get a little disturbing.  But I would recommend Hunger Games to any teenager or older.  I read Hunger Games on the Kindle and did not notice any formatting errors or typos.
This book shows up like it sat in the rain along with a library stamped on it, so it might have been stolen? Also there is scribbling throughout the book as if a 2 year old got ahold of it with a pen and scribbled away on it. Used books to me mean that is has some wear and tear on it, this was also a gift for my wife and I have to buy another copy from some where else for I would never give this book out as a gift and in fact I am contacting the library which is stamped on it letting them know I have their book. If it turns out ok then I will donate it to my local book store. I will never use this company again.
Do not pick up this book and read the first page if you have any activities planned for the next four hours or so. Dates, school, shopping, sleeping, eating- any activity- for if you turn the page to begin reading  page two you will not put this book down until you reach it's amazing and wonderful ending. This is the first book in a trilogy. I am so thankful  Amazon has all three books. I ordered the first one thinking I'd see if I like it. I am re-reading it waiting for the second book. Every reviewer will tell you about the story- but this is about an incredible heroic 16 year old girl. She is real- I know her, I just read about her and I love her.  One of the best girl empowerment books I have ever read.
This has to be one of the best books I have read in a long time. I haven't had a book hold my interest in a long time.  It makes you feel like you are in this crazy world.  Reminds me of how I felt when I read Jurassic park. You just think when you wake up that this is how the world is now. Scary part is this could happen in the near future if we let it.  Not being paranoid but I cat explain how real and engulfed you become.  How someone thought this up is astounding to me.  I loved it.  A must read for the conspiracy theorist out there, or anyone else.  You won't  be disappointed.  Worth the money I assure you
To be honest, I accidentally purchased this book while trying to figure out my Prime book loan membership.  No regrets.  The book was very entertaining (minor gripes if you're a literature nut like myself but we can't all be Faulkner).  It's a fast read but I still felt satisfied with plot, character development, relationships, etc.  What a world these characters live in.  I was tempted to immediately buy the rest of the series but decided to enjoy my satisfaction in the first a bit longer.  Another plus with purchasing this particular book was that I was able to loan it out to another Kindle user.  Very fun!
I wonder what I have been doing with my life to not have read this book sooner. Read this one and the other 2 in 3 days. The invitation into this unfamiliar world, as the Twilight and Harry Potter series is what intrigues me first. The relationships and inner motivations are what made me not able to put the book down.  I don't think this book is appropriate for youth or even young teen. Not only is there killing and loss, but suggestions of torture and mutilation is also present in the book. These scenes are pretty graphic and disturbing.  All in all, a great read. Sad that I finished it.
I put off reading this book for the longest time, mainly because I don't like novels written in the first-person, present-tense point of view.  I still don't, but I have to admit that this book kept me entertained.  I read most of it in one sitting, and now I'm itching to read the next two in the series.  The characters are unforgettable and the story (while not entirely original) is sure to keep me thinking about it for a while.  This is definitely something fans of YA dystopian fiction would love.  While it's not perfect, it's undoubtedly engaging and engrossing.  I can't wait to read the next two books.
Must face it, I'm a big fan of Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games. Her will to see the lives of her family, "cousins" and friends protected and her own human survival skills are pretty impressive in this first book.  I really wonder how they'll make the Capitol look in the upcoming movie too.  I'm becoming a bigger and bigger fan of great YA (young adult) literature. The brevity of the writing, succinct storylines and generally interesting characters make them worthwhile ... and don't seem to just retread the usual writing we see with fiction. Maybe it's the younger, more unpredictable Millennial leads?
I would actually rate Hunger Games (the first book of the trilogy) at closer to 5-starts, but the 2nd book as 4-stars and the final 3rd book below that.  In the first book the protagonist is the quintessential troubled teen in many respects who we love despite, and in some cases because of her shortcomings. Her lack of development in the subsequent books is disappointing.  It becomes harder to like or admire her, and there isn't anyone else to care about either.  After the last book I wan't hungry for anymore.  If you've made it this far, please check the box that this review was helpful. Thanks!
I read it so fast that I had to read it again. Both times I cried so hard for Rue and I fell in love with Peeta almost instantly. The story flowed smoother than anything I've read in a long, long time. Ms. Collins is a very talented writer  and her imagery is absolutely amazing. I plan to read it again and again. I am so glad that I read the book before I watched the movie.  The storyline is brutal, but life is brutal. Just watch the nightly news if you don't believe me. Teenagers see and participate in worse than this in most video games.  I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
I started reading this off of a friend's recommendation, and was slightly skeptical when I read it was meant for grade 7 and up but I really enjoyed this book. The book itself is written simply, like what one might think how a seventh grade book is written, but it didn't take away from the story at all. I don't read much (mostly because of a lot of school work) but I couldn't put this book down. I read from about 20% into the book to the end on a Sunday, most of the time just thinking "okay, one more Chapter." About seven hours later I ordered the second one for my Kindle and am going to start it tonight.
Take the best parts of "Theseus and he Minotaur", "The Running Man", "Uglies," "Brave New World," and a few other dystopian novels, mash 'em up, and you've got The Hunger Games. Few writers can hurtle though a story this intense without overworking certain scenes, giving away the climax, or confusing the reader, but Suzanne Collins balances brutality, social commentary, and the coming of age angle as precisely as her reluctant protagonist. I am halfway through the sequel and it is every bit as good, if not better, so this is a storyline worth your time, and I highly recommend it for readers of all ages.
I was hooked on this book in the first couple pages and could not stop reading it.  What I love about it is that it keeps your attention (you are constantly dying to know what is going to happen next) and it also has important messages about economic oppression and tyranny.  Often when I am reading I have to sacrifice intellectual meaning to get fast paced thriller type material.  What I love about this book is that it has both.  I 100% recommend reading it!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I reserve 5 stars for the very best.  The Hunger Games is very close to that level though.
Suzanne Collins is an extremely talented author!  I chose the 5 star because I have high standards for books, but not only did this book meet my standard, it exceeded them by ALOT! I love all the characters,Suzanne's imagination,and how its written; the book's ability to come alive! I would recommend this book to maybe 8/9+  because its a little descriptive on the gorey parts, but if you're like me, you'll love how it kinda comes alive!  Suzanne- Thank you for writing this great book and if it shows anything, I now have a HUNGER GAMES CRAZE!!!!!!    Love, Katniss_is_my_hero_!
As long as I don't spend too much time typing, this should be review #1347.  I haven't read through all the reviews, but I'm pretty sure that anything I might say has already been said.  This book and the rest of the trilogy is one of my all time favorites and I think it'll probably remain near the top of the list, no matter how many books I read.  I remember reading Lord of the Rings back in high school (a long time ago), sitting in the hall upgainst somebody's locker, trying to get in a little more reading in between classes.  This is like that; something that sticks with you for a lifetime.
Congratulations to Ms. Collins for coming up with such a unique plot!  This is such a breath of fresh air among all the vampire and werewolf, teen drug and sex, and wizard stories that are coming out right now.  The characters are realistic and even easy to relate to.  The plot is enthralling and intense.  Even the setting was fascinating.  There's great action, a little bit of romance, lots of suspense, and serious anger towards the Capitol.  This is a page-turner that can be enjoyed by young adults and adults alike.  (Probably PG-13 for violence.)  I am excited to see what happens in the next one!
Katniss, Prim, Peeta, Gale, Rue...crochet; all are key players in The Hunger Games.  This book is a slow starter and might make you wonder why you picked it up.  But before you know it, you don't want to put it down!  At the beginning it's hard to imagine where The Hunger Games is taking you as it crochets a pattern of family and survival, love and hate, beauty and grotesque, life and death - each theme briefly hidden and then reappearing like the thread in a crochet garmet.  And finally, it concludes with an ending that leaves you wanting more.    Eulus Dennis, author - Living Between The Line
This is pretty much the template to follow if you are going to do thought provoking work without slipping into morose adult BS.A serious page turner that leaves you begging for a sequel without being desperate about wanting one by the end. Everyone was excited about this book before it came out in the publishing world. EVERYONE.   A screwed up world, with heartfelt (not sappy) characters who feel palpable with enough stuff in there to keep teens in touch with their own inner lives. It's Lord of the Flies meets Thunder Dome , meets the Ms. USA pageant meets a cringe inducing reality show.Awesome.
Ok first of all it is violent but not so much it is a not read ther is a certain amount there to keep you on the edge of your seat. I have never really read books like these, but I have to admit I am now.  I read all of the trilogy and reread. It is amazing on how close to real life it is  the roman days reality tv and people doing anything fora good show!! Well I'm just sayin I was sceptical but Iam gladi read them and again I never read books like these before and none have matched them since. Kids won't be terrified but it will leave then thinking in a good way trust me I'm a kid 15 yrs myself
This is certainly a page turner, and I found myself struggling to put it down. Recommended to me by my daughter, I was hesitant to read it because of the dark nature of the story but I'm certainly glad that I did!  I enjoy stories that highlight a powerful independent female protagonist and this book certainly delivers.  Fast paced story that will keep you frozen in place until you complete it!  For those who enjoyed Hunger Games as much as I did, I also recommend Burn in Hades (The Life After Death Trilogy, Book 1), another captivating read on my Top 10 books of this year.
Beautifully written, completely captivating from the instant you turn the first page. I have recommended this book to several friends, and have never encountered someone who didn't love it. Susan Collins sure knows how to keep your attention, in this riveting dystopian tale of a girl's struggle to survive against all odds. True love and intrigue, Katniss struggles to determine who is on her side, trapped in a myriad of friends and foes. This book takes you to the breadth of human kindness, and delves into the darker side of human nature. The stakes are high when to lose means your certain death.
I picked up this book with no knowledge of what it was about, but as soon as I started reading I couldn't stop. I finished in a day and thought it was great. I read some of the lower reviews to see what it was they didn't like and I was kind of surprised. Many said that the book was too gruesome. I completely disagree. While the idea of what is happening is shocking and brutal, I think it was done in a way that it wasn't too gruesome or graphic. Especially too much to give the book 1 star. I'll definitely be recommending it to many friends and family members. And I'm positive I'll read it again.
My choice of reading is thrillers so when my sister told me she was reading this book I told her I didn't think I would like it. I definitely didn't want to read it after seeing the movie trailer. She insisted I would like it. Long atory short. It was great. Fast paced page turner.  After reading the book I defintiry don't want to see the movie because I'm a bit squeamish LOL  i love a good writer that can make you visualize every detail. That's a good writer.  The whole idea of being sent to a arena to fight to the death is just a bit much but it was definitely a good read.
I held out for a long time on this series, thinking it would be more of the same. There's lots of Dystopian literature out there, how much better could this be? Boy, was I wrong. The thing that distinguishes this series is the writing. This is the Harry Potter of Dystopian lit. There's not one time that you don't feel completely invested in the characters, not once when you think "He/she wouldn't have said that." You are IN the story the entire time, waiting to see what happens next. Thanking higher powers that you don't have to live in the world of the Hunger Games. Highly Recommended.
I prefer to almost always buy things directly FBA (fulfilled by amazon) if at all possible, and I was glad these books for coming from a non-sort FC (smaller items). This book, amongst the other 5 I purchased for my birthday, came wonderfully packaged and in perfect condition, as if I had just picked it up off the shelf.  The book: This book is REALLY hard to put down for the ones that still have not read it. I first saw the movie and I've been trying not to rent Catching Fire before I've read the books and it is PERFECT. Its much more detailed but not too off to where it's hard to follow.
If you're on the fence about reading these take this as an invite from someone who is a serious reader to go ahead. I find this book worthy of the hype and large fan following.  The story moves fast, the post apocalyptic world of Panem is beleivable, most of the characters are well drawn, and the lessons about humanity in the face of tyranny and degredation profoundly connect with the narrative.  Collins also manages to speak deeply through these pages about our predatory reality TV/celebrity obsessed culture.  First class story-telling, thought provoking without moralizing, and a joy to read.
I have to admit I had first seen the movie before reading the book, but I must tell you the book is much richer and depth. It's full of details and descriptions. You'll really feel the despair of the inhabitants of the 12 District. It's pointless to go on further details regarding the story, but I can tell it's great how the author described this futuristic American society and the struggle between the different districts. Finally, don't think this is another teenager's book, this is actually a mature and violent story, with a great background and ambience. Two thumbs up and more for this one!
The Hunger Games is set in post-apocalyptic America.  A place in the future (not too very far in the future)  where the government has finally gained complete control of it's masses.  The concept is frightening, the reader finds themselves very engaged in the characters pretty early on in the first book.  I loved that our heroine, Katness Everdeen, has a name that brings up imaginings of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  The novel is new age and dark ages blended into a tension that will have the reader turning pages well into the wee hours.  Even if you have seen the movie, don't pass up this read.
I could not put this book down! From the very first sentence, I could tell I was going to love the story. I had not yet heard of it, hadn't even read any reviews (or even the jacket cover).  The previous owner of my Kindle had the good grace to leave it for me to find, and the title caught my eye one night.  Suzanne Collins paints such a clear picture of her characters and the world they live in.  I fell in love with Katniss and found myself rooting for her throughout the book.  I ended up buying the book for my fifteen year old niece for Christmas, and I am positive she is going to love it.
By now most people interested already have an idea of the setting and story. What is hard to portray in a review is just how addictive the book is from the first few pages, and how well it handles the inevitable death within. It has gory deaths, but they are treated in a way that feels mature. The entire book makes me think of a violent Pixar film; appropriate for all ages, without the pandering that worse stories use. Post-apocalyptic settings and reality-show type death games have been everywhere in media for the last decade; and this easily stands out as one of the best representations.
Came across this book while looking for a new series for my 13 year old.  The premise....sounds absolutely awful, however this book is in my top 5 all time favorites!  Suzanne Collins had me riveted, I could not put it down until I was finished and was upset I didn't have the 2nd book in hand immediately. I have suggested this series to at least 30 people, ranging in age from 12-65, not a single person has been disappointed.  Many of the readers have thanked me profusely for the suggestion!  The characters are facinating, lovable, hateful and painted exquisitely!  Fantastic read for all!
Ok, this is a rip-off of a rip-off...and chances are, you may have already read or watched this movie/book already.  In 1982, Stephen King, aka Richard Bachman wrote 'The Running Man', which was turned into 'The Running Man' movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1987. Only difference is that this story changes 'convicts' into 'selected teenagers'...same plot, same action, same wrong-turned-right intent.  If that isn't enough, there was a Japanese story called 'Battle Royale', which was first published before 2000, with english translation in 2003 (2nd ed was 2009), with additional sequels afterward. The movie was released originally in 2000 in Japan...and is not only a better more-believable story than 'The Hunger Games', but is IDENTICAL in story and intent...THE HUNGER GAMES is a massive work of plagerism!  If you don't like plagerism, if you think copying another's work is wrong, if you believe in copyright and original artist's rights...you would boycott this book and movie...see the original works, instead...they are BETTER.
I have been a teacher for nearly 18 years, and I have never had a novel that every kid in a class loved.  They keep asking me to get the next two.  I have kids that are not even in my classes ask me if they can borrow one.  I think the amazing details along with the compelling characters makes it one of the best books that has come out in a long long time.  Katniss, Peeta, Haymich, and all the rest nearly become real people.  The games themselves offer so much for lively discussions.  Lately much of the talk has been about the upcoming movie.  Here's hoping it will live up to the novel.
What can I say about this book besides WOW? I went in a skeptic because bandwagon literature and series tend to be dumbed down for the masses. I found the writing to be urgent, but meaningful. Hurried, but organized. This was all necessary to keep up with the fast tempo of the story. How the author managed to roll along with the abruptness of the progression of the plot, while also developing complex and relatable characters is beyond me but BRAVO. It immediately sucked me in and I literally COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I read it all in less than 24 hours. Worth every penny and every minute.
The Hunger Games is one of those novels that stay with you long after you are finished reading. While most books in the YA genre are not appealing to older readers, the Hunger Games is an exception. The story is compelling, very visual and well written. By the end of the novel I truly cared for the two main characters and found myself in tears many times while reading. The violence was just disturbing enough to keep me on the edge of my seat and I would not recommend for readers under 13. I truly want to know what happens next and sincerely hope Suzanne Collins is writing a follow up.
Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, is a dystopian novel that is in the point of view of Katniss Everdeen. The world has changed and all the continents are mashed together to form one big landform, Panem. There are 12, one was destroyed, districts in Panem and Katniss lives in district 12. Every year the capital holds the hunger games, where they send two people, one boy and one boy, from each district where they have to fight off to their death. Her younger sister, Prim, is drawn to play in the games but Katniss volunteers to take her spot. Now she has to fight for her right to live.
This is one of the best books I've read in a while. It's the kind of book that you read where you're like "Eh, I'll read one more chapter..." One more turns into two and then three and so on... You can't put it down. I would stop at times and then glance at the book wondering what would happen next. So, I had to keep going even if my eyes were tired. This book tugs on your heartstrings and fills you with anticipation to get to the end. I'm going to get the second book immediately. I haven't seen the movie yet, but want to. I'd recommend this book to everyone--absolutely magnificent.
I read this when it first came out, but didn't have the chance the read the second two books in the trilogy.  With the movie coming out I decided to pick it up again and read the entire trilogy.  I think it might have been better the second time.  It is a quick read, but that isn't a bad thing.  I both loved and hated the characters in this book, which made the gripping story even better.  The character development is what this book stand out.  There have been other books with similar plots, but having the characters be so real, lovely, faulty, and broken makes this one a must read.
I had heard of this book but was never really interested in it even though I knew absolutely nothing about the story.  I was browsing on Amazon and came across the book and was able to read a few pages from the book and was absolutely HOOKED!!!  I understand that it is written for young adults, however, it is a very compelling story and not entirely implausible at the rate our world is changing.  The Hunger Games themselves are reality television, gladiators and the Olympic games all rolled into one.  I've only read the first book and I can't wait to dive into books two and three.
This first book is a decent read, interesting concept, and moves at a good pace.  You get to know the characters enough to care and no parts are boring.  However, be warned that this is the best book in the series by far and the plot and writing get worse and worse as you go to book 2 and then to book 3.  It starts to get very predictable and her writing's biggest weakness (describing some of the action scenes) shows up a lot in book 3 since there is a lot of action.  So I'm warning you now that you may enjoy the first book and maybe the second, but if you start this series and read all three books you might end up disappointed overall like I was.
I'm gonna be quick and say that from the first page I fell in love with the main character, Katniss, she is brave, stubborn and quite funny I must add. When she was chosen alongside Peeta I liked the chemistry between them, they were a great team. I will not say anything about this book cause I think there are a lot reviews that say what happens there, I just want to say CONGRATS to the author, Suzanne Collins. This is the best book that I ever read in my life, in spite the fact that isn't my type. But now, thanks to you, this type of book is my favorite.  Congrats Suzanne!!!
If you're considering reading this trilogy for the first time, trust in all the lovers of these books, which out-do the movies by far! I've come to accept the movies, the third one came closest to the book for me, but I still return to the books for a great story that satisfies me every time I feel like reading them again! I've lost track how many times I've read them, but let's say I've gotten more than my monies worth! If they offer all 3 books at a reduced price, you may as well get the set, I'm quite sure you'll want to plow into the next one as soon as you finish the first!
This book, in fact the entire series, is so intense and so riveting that I think it's NOT good for very young teens to read it - even though it was written for adolescents and teens The subject matter is gruesome, horrifying and violent, but the writer somehow keeps the main characters from the worst of it. It is a warning of what COULD happen in our country and is similar to what some young people in the world already experience. An excellent read for adults and perhaps an object lesson for us all to keep in mind to prevent something like this from happening in our own country.
Outstanding is all I can say. I guess I did this in reverse of most people. As I did not have interest in the movie when it came out and have only recently watched it. The movie was outstanding and made me curious as to just how good the book would be as the movie can never tell the whole story as they have to fit so much in to a 2 hour slot. So I loaded up the book and used Audible for Android and listened to it as I am not a reader. All I can say is after a sleepless night I had listened to the whole book and left me wanting more of the story. Great read or listen in my case.
 movie  "<span class="a-size-base review-text">I watched the movie inline with the book and the book is way better. The plot is much more straightforward and comprehensive than the movie. The movie was like unlinked series of events because the movie script did very poorly of explaining the actions of Katniss. Katniss in the book was a smart woman who knew how to hunt and fend for herself because of the time she spent with Gale. The movie Katniss appeared to wander aimlessly without reason for her survival of the Hunger Games.  If you don't want to waste any time, just read this book instead of watching the movie.
I had never heard of Hunger Games &amp; saw it in the store where they put the latest best sellers.  It did't grab me at first, but after asking the clerk, &amp; checking some online reviews I thought why not.  I didn't expect much based on the initial feedback, but this is one of the fastest paced books I've read.  The author creates constant suspense &amp; action, and she is not afraid to shock you.  Great setting, great story line, constant suspense, twists, turns, ..... everything.  Brilliant book !!!  I read all 3 in 2 weekends. The other two are just as good.
I heard of this book through upcoming movies on the internet and thought i should see what it is all about. Once i started reading I couldn't stop, this book kept my attention and made me want to read more once it was over. I will not say anything specific about the book b/c their are many that may not have read it but there is good character building and it has a great story that flows real well. I recommend reading this book if you are into a bit of adventure, turmoil, and political rebellion... it was a very satisfying read. As a side not once i read this i had to buy the 2nd book, which is just as good, I will be starting the 3rd once I get a bit free time.
Finally, a new, interesting, captivating, and impossible to put down story! From beginning to end it is brilliant! There is not another book like this! I read at least a book a week, and have been getting bored with the same ole stuff over and over. Until I read this. What a relief! The depth, humor, heartache, action, romance, death, life, choices, thoughts, feelings, characters, writing...it is so real. While reading, I felt as if I was there the whole time. The ending could not have been better. If any series could equal or surpass the Twilight saga, this is it. Love it!
The Hunger Games could be violent at times, but it kept me interested. It was brilliantly written and kept me wanting more! The ending kept you wondering what happens next. During the actual Hunger Games, you will feel that same feeling Katniss does, Suzanne Collins did an excellent job with that. If you see the movie before you read the book, please understand that the book is so much better than the movie. The movie makes the Hunger Games seem darker and a lot more violent and morbid than it really is. The book will give you an entirely different perspective. I loved it.
I thoroughly enjoyed this book and was very surprised that I did. For some reason I thought this was was younger readers and then discovered many of my friends had read it also. I was going to order the trilogy and then thought ...I'll just get the first book and see if I like it. Now I wish I had! The end of this book has left me wanting for more...will Peeta get Katniss? This book transported me into another world...another future,  yet it makes you think that this could be our world someday. It is everyone's responsibility to prevent this scenario from ever happening.
Yes, this review is not a review. Everyone knows now about the mega roller coaster called Hunger Games. And every girl has the dream and excuse now other people standing in her way in the hunger games.  Anyway, I am just in the mood of writing today while I hate writing. I just came here to pay my respects to one of the best books of all time.  If you haven't read, don't feel outdated, just go read it. It has a personal sense to it. I only read it once, and I like to read books alot. But certain scenes are unforgettably.  May this Book be in your favor.
Yes I believe so. I really do think this is an excellent story and well written. Just not too well written... that is why I gave only four stars and not 5. It is an amazing story and plot line, you get to the end of every page, chapter, and section and can't wait to continue. I read the entire book in two nights, I just could not stop reading.  However, I feel Suzanne Collins needs some help with her writing ability and needs to show hegemony of some vocab. She also falls victim to her fear of skipping over the gruesome parts too quickly almost leaving you feeling rushed
I had heard alot about this book from my friends and decided to give it a try along with Catching Fire and The Mockinjay....I bought them from Amazon instead of a book store and saved alot of money (I got 2 in hard cover and one in paperback)....But just being told about how great the book(s) are doesn't do justice to the story! I recommend these books to everyone!!!! I read the first one in 3 days (I couldn't put it down) and I just couldn't wait to get to the next book to see what will happen. And I am now on the edge of my seat to see the movie when it comes out!!!!
Aimed at young adults but a great read for anyone, The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic United States where a cowed populace must submit two children from each territory to fight to the death on television. A compelling plot, a fast pace and sympathetic three dimensional characters make this book a great read. With echos of 1984 and Lord of the Flies, Collins explores the themes of government control, individuality, humanity, friendship, reality TV and survival. I'm not usually a fan of this genre but this particular book was so well written that I was hooked.
In a dystopian future where the United States has collapsed and brutal regime has taken its place, young Katniss must participate in the Hunger Games. The games are a yearly spectacle, a televised fight to the death between 24 teenagers selected by lot. Think Gladiators + American Idol + Survivor. Katniss was forced to volunteer for the games in order to save her younger sister. It is basically a death sentence. This story is sad, violent, at times touching, at times even a bit humorous (in a ghoulish way), and often terrifying. I will have to read the entire series.
I loved this book too but I was shocked and saddened to see so many grammatical errors.  Even if Ms. Collins never learned the difference between 'lie' and 'lay' (two instances of misuse) or that prepositions take the objective case (at least two instances), are there no editors or proofreaders who did?  And this is at Scholastic Press, supposedly the arbiters of all things educational!  There were other errors of usage, which I find unforgivable.  What a terrible example to set for young people in a country that has clearly let learning be put on the back burner.
I've read some classic si-fy/fantasy and this does not compare in complexity to books like Lord of the Rings or Dune. That being said, the book is a teen book, so expectations shouldn't be set that high. The characters and their development is great and I was hooked after the first chapter. While young, the characters fight their way through a very dystopic world with very mature attitudes. I also love that the main character is a strong female, something that is often lacking in pop-culture. If I had teenage children I would definitely encourage them to read this.
It was impossible to put down and think about anything else than survival. Such dystopian fiction is perfect for any teenager, or still, anyone of any age to immerse themselves in. Collins should be praised for her ability to create such a world that is so cruel, and yet where no reader would want to escape from once lost in it. Our central character Katniss is beautifully vulnerable, a character only considered from long thought and analysis to suit Collins' hostile realm. Read if you need mental and emotional inspiration from Katniss' strength and determination.
I started this book with very high expectations since every review I have read and even heard of sang it praises. Now that I am finished all I can think is: Oh...my...freaking...gosh. I think I love this book. It lived up to and surpassed my expectations! Action packed in every sense of the words it is all about survival and the emotional after effects. It has a love story but none of those gushy instantaneous love situations. You can clearly see it concerns relationships forged by time and trials. I will definitely be reading "Catching Fire" as soon as possible.
I was first itroduced to this book so a book club almost three years ago. Back then, we had no idea that it would become the hit that it is today, but we all loved it. I remember this was the most popular book our club talked about, and we all eagerly awaited Ctaching Fire.  And not without reason! Collins really GETS it. Unlike many of the copies that are being produced, Collins had been able to find a balance between everything that you must have to write a book set in a world like this. Danger, love, determination, and sacrafice.  Good job!
This is an amazing book.  I loved it from cover to cover.  To those who critize it's "lack of a moral" - you just don't get it.  I'm definately giving this book to my teenage grandkids.  The entire point of this book is about sacrificing one's self and about appreciating what we have today because our world could change.  I want my kids to understand and be grateful for the very food on the table.  I loved it and I know my grandchildren will too.  I finished reading this book at 1 a.m. and immediately downloaded the next one on my Kindle Fire and started reading!
I picked up this book after reading about it in women's magazines and seeing it hyped up on my college campus. Yes, it is a YA novel, but man oh man, it was a GREAT read from start to finish. I am so glad I picked it up. I was hooked immediately. It is so rare to read a book when you can't wait to get home to keep reading...and this is exactly like that! Very,very creative/clever, detail oriented, and well-written. I feel compelled to read the next book in the series. I am telling all my friends about this too! Simply a FAB read for all ages and genders. A+++++++
I had heard this trilogy was for young adults but that is not true! You already know the plot, so I won't go into it. The books were highly recommended to me by a 62 year old woman. Being a baby boomer, I devoured the trilogy in no time flat. And then after you have read the trilogy, you are not in the mood for any other books because you are still reliving those moments from The Hunger Games. I loved this book and recommend it to everyone, young and old! I can't wait to see the movie in March to see the spectacular costumes and Katniss fighting to the death.
This book was so fast moving and amazing. The plot is one of those that you wonder how somebody could come up with it and the characters in this book was great and I love that play on words with Petahs name (his dad is a baker and his name is Petah a.k.a. petah bread. Sorry if I spelled it wrong.) I like that Katniss volunteered to be in the Hunger games it makes the evil of it seem more soft. I also liked how the author mixed the hard core  killing in the games with the sadness of Rues death. Quite a good book. Anybody so hasn't read it I hope you read it.
I thought that this was one of the most amazing books I have ever read! I started it on a plane ride and didn't stop the WHOLE time!!!!!! I thought this was VERY well written. I don't know what to read now because not only am I thinking about the characters that she gave life to, I don't know what kind of book can follow this up! If anyone is even thinking of reading this book... STOP THINKING AND START READING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was soooooo amazing... I can't wait for the second book to come out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (September 1st)
A friend told me of this book and encouraged me to read it.  I am glad I did as it fits right into the worlds I like to find myself in when reading.  There are certain things that Suzanne Collins puts into the books that I feel only a true hunter would understand so it makes me think that she's either lived the life of an outdoors person or had references close to her that they could explain some of the little items that she added. Some of them made me laugh because I've experienced the same things in my time. A great read and thanks for the adventure.
As you can tell by the reviews and popularity of the book it is a fine read. I read it in 3 days, two of which I worked 12 hr shifts. It is very entertaining and fast paced, you fall in love with many characters even the ones you wish you didn't. I often reminded myself that I was reading a book about children thrown into an environment in which  the "kill or be killed" reigned supreme. It made me think that maybe current culture is not too far from the premise, I hope I am wrong but it is fathomable. It was at times predictive, but still a great read.
This was definetly my favorite book ever. The dystopian theme that seems to be so popualr in young adult books now was horrifying and facinating at the same time. It gives readers a look on poverty and hunger. I laughed at the frivolous capitol people and cried during the blood-curling scenes of the Hunger Games. I love the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. I love the passion and strenght that Katniss has and the bond between her and Peeta, because they where in the Games together and survived. Just one question. Was anyone on team Gale??
I am not a young adult and I generally hate post-apocalypse sci-fi fantasy -- and the description sounded awful.  But this was a book club selection, so I read it.  And then I read the next two books in the trilogy.  All in one weekend.  I loved these books. Really, really loved them.  I am not sure if it's the characters, especially Katniss, or the way it made me think about violence, goodness, evil, children and war, or if it was just the great storytelling.  But who cares.  These are immensely readable and thoughtful books for kids and for adults.
I bought this book not knowing what it was about, but after reading it I have no regrets. It had a great plot, lots of action, and quite a bit of suspence, all great things in a book, it's also well written in a way that makes it enjoyable for anyone from high school students to your more aged readers. I wasn't aware that it was a part of a trilogy, however it ends in a way that would make it a great book that could have stood by itself with out the other parts of the trilogy. It really is an altogether great book and I suggest you give it a read. :)
This is by far the best book I have ever read. For all those two star rating haters GET A LIFE!!!  For the parents out there looking at these reviews to see if this is an okay book for their kids to read it is.I'm 11 a d my dad didnt want me readi g tbis because he thought it sounded too violent but i coaxed him into reading it so he could prove there was something wrong with it and he didnt find anything and the whole seiries except for tthe third book is great the third book is a little rushed but still okay i guess. SO DONT BE A HATER!!!!!!!!! :D
I loved this book (and the whole series too!)!! It was a compelling story full of expertly created characters. Suzanne Collins has the ability to create unique worlds where you can escape with the characters. You feel what they feel and are put into the ethically challenging situations that she puts her characters into. I have read this series two times over and intend on reading it again before the movie comes out. I know some people have given this a poor review but what they fail to remember is that it is just a story. READ IT!! You'll love it!!
Bought the trilogy after hearing so much about it this year. It is a totally engaging read. Author paints a great picture and I could see it all in my mind, just how a book should play out as you read. I'm over 40 and really liked it.  I also twisted my son's arm and nagged and pushed this book on him to try and get him to just READ....and as soon as he started, he read it all in 2 days. That was like the 2nd book he ever read that wasn't assigned to him from school and he truly liked it a lot.  Definitely a BUY recommendation.
I originally read this in paperback several years ago when the book came out , and loved it.  It happens that I was in the middle of a cross country trip and realized the movie was coming out, so of course, I had to re-read the books beforehand.  I bought Hunger Games on my Kindle so that I could re-read the whole lot before seeing the movie.  I also shared this with my Mom who promptly read all three books in three days...she then shared it with a friend who "doesn't read" who knocked all three out in a week and a half.  I think that says it all!
Wow, just wow! I got this on an acquaintance's recommendation. Was not too sure about a "youth book". I picked it up lightly one day when I didn't want a book I might actually get into. Whoops. From about page 3 I was lost. Lost to the book. I could not put it down. I was actually bummed I had to go to sleep! I started it later in the evening so technically it took me two days to read this. I cannot wait to get the next two books. Every page is important, there is no useless filler in this book. And talk about a cliffhanger ending! Love this book.
I loved it!  I'm not a big fan of dystopian novels as they usually paint a bleak future. Hunger Games is different, so different. It slips in that secret hope that within each heart no matter how dark, there is that human element. The thing that helps us put one foot in front of the other and become our brother's keeper.  This amazing book contains that inner gyro that keeps faith in humanity alive and kicking. The story begins much like that classic short story, The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, but it goes on to grab the reader and never let go. I'm ready for the next book in the series. This is really good reading!
This book was chosen for our book club and is one of the reasons I love book clubs since I never would have read it on my own. I was afraid of another teenage Twilight-ish book (and don't get me wrong, I enjoyed those books too, I just wanted something different) but The Hunger Games had me hooked from the first page. I couldn't put it down, it was well paced, had well developed characters and left me wanting more. Read at your own risk, because if you start this book, you won't be able to stop till you've finished off the whole of the series.
I thought this book taught some beautiful lessons on true humanity and what can become of us when we give in to what we know is not right!!  It's a story you won't want to stop reading, and it transports you to another world, a sad and dreary world where people are not treated with respect or kindness, where hunger is the norm in the districts, but the people of the Capital eat delicacies and live in luxury. The conflict richly works within as well as outside the characters you will grow to love.  Trust me, you won't want to stop at Book one.
At first I did not really want to read this book. My friend convinced me and now I cant put them down. After I got done reading this book I went to the next. THis book made me laugh, cry, and it made me sad. Its sad how Katniss and Gale family live. It also it's sad how the Capitol has all these poeple from different districts doing game competition to the death for food. Loved how Katniss ended up becoming Peeta partner to win and just loved what they did at the end. I am Team Katniss all the way. It is a must read and its so worth the time.
The book that I purchased as a used book was in excellent condition.  It was a great purchase. As I read the first couple of chapters I didn't think I was going to like it.  I'm not into futuristic science fiction. However, as the story progressed, the twists and turns kept my attention.  If you can get through the teen violence, you will like the story.  And the author does an excellent job of setting up the second book.  When I read a book that makes me think about it when I'm not reading, I consider it a good book.  This was a good book.
I enjoy a good fantasy and am sick of the quest scenarios.  The Hunger Games is aimed at young adult readers but as a not at all young adult - I very much enjoyed it.  Good main characters - a few fringe ones seemed less so well defined especially in so far as motives etc. Having said that- as the story is told from the viewpoint of the main character Katniss, I guess that accords with her own limited knowledge of them. The plot line is terrific as well as the twists and turns.  Could not put it down and read all 3 volumes within few days.
I literally read this book cover-to-cover in 1 day. It was by far one of the best books I have ever read. I always buy books online so I can get good deals but after reading the first book I had to go to the bookstore and buy the second one for full hardcover price. I am about 50 pages in and was definitely worth the $20.  The way she describes all the details was so riveting that I found myself really connecting with the characters in the book. I would say anyone from 12 to 100 would enjoy the action/love/suspense of this amazing book!
This is the book that got me interested in Dystopian fiction.  Suzanne Collin's has such a gift with words. Her writing is so vibrant and rich that at times I forgot that I wasn't actually safe in my home.  At the beginning of each chapter I would tell myself, "Self, you can only read ONE MORE Chapter and then you have to (fill in the blank...Cook, clean, eat, bathe, take care of family, ect...)" Needless to say, I didn't listen to myself :o} I kept reading and reading until I was done and after that I replayed the story over and over in my head.  This is a story that will stay with me for the rest of my days.
The Hunger Games is a great book. I'm so glad I read this book. It's so good, that even though I'm only ten, it only took me five hours. It was so amazing. I felt like I was really Katniss, the girl on fire. The author did a good job on not to heavily descriving the bloodiness. Also, she did a good job of putting clever little twists in here and there. The plot was amazing from the first page. If you have not read the Hunger Games, you have not lived life. The Hunger Games is a great book (t is took me one hour thirty minutes to write).
I was captivated by Collin's writing from the first page. She has incredible character and plot development- withholding information and revealing it at just the right time. However once the "Games" began, the violence was just too much for me. I was thinking about it in the middle of the night and truly disturbed. While the story is unique and compelling, it is not for a young audience. I'm a 25 year old woman and it's too much for me. As much as I have come to love the characters in The Hunger Games, I will not be reading the sequel.
I am not totally sold on this book.  It really does control the reader, while other books give you time to think about other solutions to problems or what might happen next.  This book is just too controlling, which is the way the games are played.  The actual games are exciting but what comes before and what comes right at the end is a big cop out by the author IMHO.  I can't tell the end results but I do still feel manipulated.  And I am going to try to see the movie ASAP, just to see how close it comes to the book. No, I enjoyed the book, but do not see all the great reviews and reaction it has obtained.
This book was not exactly what I expected.  It was tastefully written about a time that could actually happen with the way the world is heading.  I was pleasently surprised that the book was not all gory, but a good story.  It was so much better than the movie which had to leave out so much of it.  Probably because much of the book is what is being thought about in the minds of the characters.  I could not put it down and immediately purchased the two sequels to THE HUNGER GAMES.  I read all 3 books in 2 1/2 days while on a road trip.
You know when you get ready to ride a roller coaster and you can see where all the twists, turns, and loops are before you hop on, but you still have a blast when you experience them?  That's kind of how I felt reading this first installment to the trilogy.  I could see many of the twists and turns coming, but that definitely didn't take away from the great ride.  Collins does a great job of moving the story along while getting you to care about her characters.  If you're looking for an addicting read, I'd recommend picking this up.
HUNGER GAMES  This is definitely one of my favorite books of all time. From the first time I picked it up, i could not put it down. The subject matter was so interesting and like nothing I had ever read before. Suzanne Collins is truly a great writer.  I was instantly enthralled with katniss' story and wanted to learn more.  All the characters are highly developed and the romance is as good as the writing.  I would recommend this to everyone and I already have to all my friends.  Its really an amazing read!  Bravo Suzanne collins!
I am the type guy that doesn't really read books, mostly watching tv &amp; movies or reading magazines about cars and other "guy stuff". However, I decided to give the sample for the kindle a try and was hooked. While I read other reviews saying the book was bad because of this or that, I found it to be a nice escape to read it. I had to fight with my wife over the kindle as she was trying to read her books, which totally shocked her, LOL!! Took me about 3-4 days to read the book. I had fun reading it and would recommend it to everyone.
This beautifully written novel absorbs the reader from its very first pages.  The author creates a vivid world whose logic immediately convinces and never flags, while the immersive process of learning the arbitrary rules of a game where error is fatal alongside Katniss and her fellow competitors suggests a world not so far from our own, with its lust for reality shows, and their abject humiliation of contestants. The Hunger Games is that rare novel that transcends age, gender, and genre, and thus deeply repays any reader's time.
I kept hearing about the hype around The Hunger Games and decided to finally check it out. So I got The Hunger Games and finished it within four days of starting. This is definitely a book you won't want to put down once you start reading. Even though the story was kind of predictable at some points, it still kept me entertained at a couple parts I didn't see coming. The writing is light and easy enough to understand without much thought. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys a young adult fantasy genre book.
An author that can take something set in the future and make it relevant in today's world is rare. That's why Suzanne Collins Hunger Games series is so popular. She takes elements of our world today with some new ideas and mixes them all up in an interesting and compelling way. I read this book very quickly and can't wait to get the next two in the series. Don't be afraid of the genre of this book. Good storytelling is good storytelling no matter what genre and Suzanne Collins has done just that - told a great story. Enjoy!
I read this first book in 2 days.  I know it's a Young Adult novel, but just like Harry Potter, it drew me in.  Suzanne Collins' writing makes it easy to visualize District 12, the trip to the Capitol and the games themselves.  When this becomes a movie, and I'm sure it will, I can't wait to see how they create Cinna's outfits.  Katniss is a likeable, humble hero.  Gale and Peeta are perfect for the love triangle.  And, this is such an interesting look into the future.  I can't wait to see how this trilogy evolves!
I believe with the popularity of the Hunger Games series there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said.  I will read the entire series, why? Because it is a great story.  I love the character development, loved the plot and I enjoyed the twists.  I guess the only thing I wish it had were pictures, but now that it has the movies, I guess that is taken care of, but illustrations from the author, like Dickens did many times may have made this great book even better.  But, that is my only complaint, superb read.
I would recommend The Hunger Games to anyone, any age. The story is intriguing, the writing is simple and yet beautiful, and the characters are unforgettable (I find myself still thinking about the characters, long after finishing). Definitely one of the best things I've read in recent years. This is my favorite book in the series, though they're all wonderful and devastating and interesting.  PROS: excellent premise, great characters, well written  CONS: none that I can think of, except that it was over too quickly!
Although marketed to teens I found this book (and series) to be appropriate for all ages.  In fact, there are many situations that may be more suitable for a mature audience and hard for young people:  brutal murder, starvation, a profoundly corrupt government and its abuse of power, just to name a few.  I am a 38 year old professional and mom of two babies and I was hooked almost immediately.  I truly cared for these characters and their ability to overcome hardships without completely losing their mind.  A must read.
Scanning through amazon, i came across this book, read the plot synopsis and reviews and had to run out and buy it right away.  Read through it in a 24 hour period.  It was amazing and i didn't want to put it down.  So excited I don't have to wait long for the sequel and I couldn't help but think of this book as a movie while i was reading.  Heard it is coming out in 2011, couldn't find any other news on the movie though.  I recommended this book to everyone and even sent it out to my brother as soon as i was finished!
This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I started it thinking it was a book just for teens but it's not. There is so much going on emotionally between the characters and its very unpredictable. The struggles Katniss had with the games as well as her inner struggles was written very well. And you could feel the tension. The emotions are intense and i found myself wrapped up in the scenes. I love a book that can keep me captivated. And the writer did exactly that.  Can't wait to read the next two books.
This book is truly easy to love.  The characters in the book are painted in such a beautiful way that you never want to put the book down.  The book introduces Katniss, a name which I love, the main character in the story.  It leads you through her world of doubt, truth, heroism, and eventually love.  She is a hunter by nature and get pulled into these "hunger games" with another character from her district, in which only one can survive. I will leave it at this and let you read the book to judge for yourself.
I saw the movie when it came out for cable viewers, it was okay. There was a lot of publicity and it seemed to be so popular, I felt "out-of-it" for not liking the movie more than just okay.  Finally, after much peer pressure from the Y/A and Teens librarian, I am reading the series. I just finished The Hunger Games, and I do like it. I am on a waiting list for "Catching Fire" and "Mockingjay". I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series, and at least getting in sync with the rest of the world.
I wasn't interested in reading this trilogy but both my daughters got on my case and insisted that I at least get The Hunger Games so we could go see the movie together.I always like to read the book first so I gave in, now I'm on the last book Monkingjay and will finish it before both my daughters. I started on the first book,and couldn't stop and I'm not looking forward to the day I finish itMockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games). Really enjoyed it, and looking for my next great book.
I had my doubts about this book at first. Being a 36 year old male, I wondered if I was being sucked into some over dramatized teenage love story, but I was pleasantly surprised. The book is well done and well written. The character development is outstanding, and although Katniss is not a typical protagonist, she grows on you as the reader, and you start to feel the weight of her burden.  I love the dystopian feel of the novel, and the picture of human depravity that is portrayed here. This is one worth reading!
I bought this last year when I was browsing for a new read on my Kindle and thought it sounded interesting. This was before I had heard anything about it being made into a movie or how popular it had become. I love it so much I'm reading the series for the second time and it's even better now. I'm a fan of science fiction that isn't too far-fetched and could imagine this happening. It's been awhile since I've run across something that I liked well enough to read again but this is that work. Let the games begin!!!
For some reason this book grabbed me and didn't let go until the last page.  For me, this book was a cross between The Giver and Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1) which resulted in this post-apocalyptic scifi adventure involving children who act more like adults than most adults I know.  Although the series takes a turn downhill, you could read just this book and still walk away feeling happy, sad, excited, apprehensive, proud, and disgusted... all at the same time.  Loved it!
Disturbing storyline, done in a tasteful, fairly non-violent, page turning way. It is a cross between The Truman Show, Survivor, Mad Max and Margaret Haddix's The Shadow Children series. Wierd, I know- but it works. Middle school girls who like fantasy will be hooked. I didn't think I'd like it when I heard the premise, but as a bookseller who has seen it flying off the shelves, I had to read it, and wasn't disappointed. If you liked this, read Margaret Haddix's "Running Out of Time" and Shadow Children series.
Seriously, this book came to me as a present from somone and I just left it on my shelf. I got bored so, I decided to get the book and start reading. After the first few chapters, Suzanne Collins completely hooked me with her book. I didn't realize I was up to a 100 pages or so until my arms got sore. I laid down on my bed and read straight for the next three hours or so. I recommend anyone of this book if they love the romance, action, and the storyline of any book in he library. This book is simply stunning.
this series is one of those books that literally stays with you everyday of your life. i cant view anything in the same way as i used to after this book. im currently finishing up the third book in the trilogy, but i want everybody to know, that these books are the first to compel an actual amazon.com review out of me. ive read that the first book is terrifying, and it is, that the second book doesnt disappoint as the middle of a trilogy and it doesnt. just read them, seriously. i dont know what else to sayl
I am a huge fan of Stephenie Meyer's, so when she suggested this book (The Hunger Games by, Suzanne Collins)on her website I looked into it. After receiveing the book I couldn't put it down. I can not wait for a second to find out more about Katniss Evergreen. She is now one of my (very few) favorite characters ever written. In my opinion, Collins (like Meyer) has a wonderful way of writing a fantastic alteration of reality and making the characters relatable. Needless to say, I enjoyed this book immensely.
How is it possible to give this masterpiece less than 5 stars! I'd give it a hundred!  I mean, it's been a really really really long while since all my desires came down to turning pages. It is terrific literature. A book that WILL BE READ many decades after we all say our Hi to the Lord. Why? Because it tells the story of a battle between humanity and its opposite within people's hearts.  The language is beyond compare.  Guys, don't you make the biggest mistake of your lives by not reading it.
Friends had been telling me to read this book, and I finally got around to it and COULD NOT put it down. I was late to work because I didn't want to stop reading the story. I read it on my lunch, breaks and finished it when I got home. Can't wait to start reading the second one. Even though it is found in the young adult category, it's a must read for any one, any age. Every page keeps you on edge, wondering what is going to happen next, with the finale making you want more. Buy, rent or borrow this book!
I just finished reading the trilogy and this book, along with the other 2, is the best that I have read in a LONG time.  I bought this book for my 12-year old daughter and decided to read it, too.  I was immediately immersed in the story and could not wait to read the others.  We both read along at different paces, but loved to talk about what happened every day and share our thoughts on the story together.  This story was written so well that the characters felt real to me and I was sad to see it end.
I was skeptical about reading this story because of the content I'd heard about.  I had not seen the movie as I prefer to read the book first.  Once I started in, I couldn't put it down.  It was so refreshing to read something totally different that kept you anxiously turning pages.  The reader just has to know what happens next!  "The Hunger Games" is one of those books that has you asking yourself "Why am I reading this?" and yet you're pulled into the story with no escape.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Contains a spoiler  Hmmm I have mixed feelings after reading the first book of this series. It was thoroughly entertaining, but therein lies the problem. I do not like the fact that I was entertained by children killing each other... I expected a revolt in the end to justify all the murder that was going on, but it never happened. It felt like Collin's was entertaining me with gladiatorial violence rather than a good story. That said, I have not read the second or third books yet. Maybe book two and three will be better. This just left a bad taste in my mouth.
This was a surprising choice for our book club, as it is a young adult book. Nevertheless, we take turns, and I wasn't sorry to have read it. The story is very engaging, Collins weaves a credible fantasy. If anything, I felt it a bit lacking in detail--not enough description of places and events to really establish a clear picture of what's going on. I also found the love scenes a bit tedious at times and drawn out. But it is a quick and interesting read, and it kept me turning the pages. Worthwhile.
I bought this book for the teens in my family. I read it, too, out of curiosity. I can't tell you that it was my favorite book but it was quite readable and I finished it. I sent it along to my mother who read it also. She was in her 90s at the time and said that it was interesting but she did not want to read the rest of the series as it was not exactly her cup of tea. My grandson read all of the series and loved them. I found all of this fascinating. I am always glad to supply a book to a reader..
I was procrastinating getting into this series, but the movie made me want to read the book. A brave yet vulnerable female lead, fighting for her life and also juggling her feelings about love, death, and the society she was born into. The book plot varies a lot from the movie (of course I prefer the things that happened in the book). Exciting, had some humor, had some grief, and suspense. Sometimes found it hard to believe this was for 7th graders &amp; up. A great dystopian novel that makes you think.
I... I am just shocked by how Suzanne has moved me in a book I was ALREADY reluctant to read. I thought that I would get to attached to some characters, and then cry for days under my blanket. But after I actually sat there, bought the book, read the first few pages... I was  hooked into this world of panem. If you are like me, people who truly get into the story you read... then I promise you tears, I promise you anger, and I promise you joy from the hilarity of how stupid reality can be sometimes.
I resisted the Hunger Games because it is listed as youth reading.  I don't usually like reading books intended for young readers (i.e. Harry Potter) but I decided to give this book a try.  I was really surprised at what a great book this is, it is very fast paced and keeps your attention gripped from the beginning.  I did however think it was much too violent and somewhat sadistic for young readers.  Definitely worth your time but make sure you have time to finish the entire series once you start.
I couldn't put The Hunger Games down.  This is an enthralling book that pulled me in immediately and never let go.  Based in the future after a war between the Capital and the 13 districts, the Capital after winning, controls the Districts with an iron hand.  The main character, Katniss Everdeen, is a tough girl of 17 that will win your heart.  After reading The Hunger Games, I quickly bought the second (Catching Fire) and third (The Mockingjay) books of the series.  I read all 3 in under a week.
Couldn't put this book down. The entire trilogy together is easily one of my favorite books of all time. Suzanne Collins does an incredible job in character development...not even a quarter of the way into the book I felt for each of the characters and took their trials and tribulations as my own. Her intense story telling and twists and turns kept me guessing (and wanting more). I'm glad I purchased this book instead of borrowing or renting from a library...I plan to read it over and over again.
Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games draws you in from the start.  In a futuristic society, where teens are plucked randomly from a drawing to participate in a fight-to-their-death televised reality game, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, an unlikely heroine rises out of obscurity to become the star and winner of the Games.  Along the way, she discovers who to trust and who to love.  An incredible fast-paced read.  You get drawn into this world and the Game.  One of the best books I've read recently.
I am not going to write a formal review of this book...there is no point...there are about a million reviews out there...I simply want to say that it is brilliant...the entire series is...and I put off reading it for a very long time because I mistakenly thought it would not interest me.  Once I began reading it...I bought the next two books in the series and read them straight through...once you start them there is simply no stopping...it is that exciting...and you have to know what happens...
My mother and brother both began reading this book at the same time. Feeling left out and having the desire to join in, I purchased this on my Kindle.  This book is one of those reads that is hard to put down. Listening to the story of Katniss, her hardships, her relationships with family and friends, and her time dealing with the Games and the Capitol makes you 'hunger' for more.  I could read this over and over. I recommend this book to anyone contemplating on reading it!
The Hunger Games (book one of the hunger games trilogy) is amazing.  It's no wonder that pre-teens and teens around the world are flocking to take up archery.  I originally downloaded this book for my son, who described the storyline in pretty broad terms.  To be honest I didn't see how it could be a good story, but it turned out to be a real page turner!  Once I started on the first book, I had to read all three.  The hunger games trilogy has to be one of the best series I've read this year.
This book is a must have for the reluctant reader - grade six.  One of my most reluctant readers had an incredible look on his face when he finished.  His emotional ridden face piqued my interest and drew me (a grade six teacher) to this book.  I wanted to see why this book captured one of my most reluctant readers...immediately I understood-gripping, high drama, page turner, I would highly suggest this book for tough, reluctant, mature readers.  Reluctant Reader Library Must Have!
I loved every moment of this series! I do agree that the third book is at some points a little harder to read but it didn't stop me from loving it! I could stop reading them and all I wanted to do was know what happened next. I read all three books in about 2 weeks :) I love the way Suzanne Collins paints a picture in your head while you are reading the Hunger games and you fall in love with almost every character she's created. This book will make you laugh, cry and leave you wanting more.
I pretty much didn't put the book down once I started reading it. You almost can't.  I liked it a lot, even though it's a lot more violent than I would expect a young adult book to be.  Even so, it's a great book. I read it after I saw the movie, and I liked the movie a lot, but enjoyed the book even more.  Katniss is an easy heroine to root for, and I plan to read Catching Fire before it comes to theater.  I definitely understand why this book has caused such a sensation.
I like that its something different than the norm.  I like that it shows girls in survival roles.  I like that it talks about the significance of healthy weight and survival.  A great way to analyze human nature,  self discovery, and traumatic stress...for young adults!  While it is very detailed it leaves much to the imagination.  I like that you get a sense of gore with out it really describing every gory detail.  I also like that there is romance with modesty.  Just really well done.
I read The Hunger Games because of all of the hoopla I had heard about it.  The hoopla was well deserved!  In fact, I went on to read the rest of the trilogy including Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Hats of to Suzanne Collins for writing three books that kept me at the edge of my seat and for choosing to make her lead character a strong believable young woman. The imagery and events in the post apocolyptic world setting may not appeal to everyone but I had no problem with it.  Great read!
I am not one to read these types of books but this book immediately caught my attention.  I found the storyline exciting with a good pace - gave up all my spare time to finish reading it.  It takes place in post-apocalyptic United States after a major uprising.  Suzanne Collins did a terrific job bringing the reader into this new world, with all of its evils and excesses.  Way to go Katniss Everdeen for taking on the Capitol!  It is a must read for anyone who likes a suspenseful novel.
Since my first read of Ender's game I have yet to find a book where I connect with the main character as well I did with Ender.  Until, The Hunger Games.  From beginning to end Suzanne Collins keeps you entirely enthralled by her heroin Katniss.  If you are wondering if this book is worth the money to purchase let me assure you it is.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.  It is a quick but enjoyable read that you will find yourself in an entirely different world fighting for your life!  Engaging and entertaining.  Entirely worthy all five stars.
I have not read any Harry Potter, Twilight, or any other kind of Tweener/Teen books.  As I'm past, well past, that age. But we were talking about them at work one day so I decided to download The Hunger Games onto my Kindle.  Fabulous book.  I couldn't put it down.  Ms. Collins is a fantastic writer.  I believe she could make a story about someone standing at a bus stop sound spectacularly interesting.  I can't wait to read the next two.  Well worth the $5 bucks I paid to download it.
I was pleasantly surprised by how GOOD this book was, and I honestly couldn't put it down once I started.  It wasn't quite the bloodbath I was anticipating either, as only one character that I truly liked was killed (I was admittedly expecting far, far more).  I sill classify it as a "downer", though, as I felt a little drained and brokenhearted upon reaching the end.  There is certainly a place for books like that though!  And this is one of the better ones!  A very, very good read!
this book gripped me from page one. i was drawn in by the strong yet vulnerable narrator, katniss, as well as this intriguing world into which i had been transported. collins' invention of the capitol and its hunger games provides a poignant comment on our own society's interest in violence as a form of entertainment as well a disapproving message about war in general. Â«the hunger gamesÂ» is an extraordinary piece of art masterfully woven by suzzane collins. it is one of the greats
I put off reading these books because I didn't want to be thrown in to yet another whirlwind of heartache, fear, anger, triumph, love, and complete terror that came with reading 'Harry Potter'. I was so involved with those characters and I didn't want to lose another set of 'friends' like I did when the series was over...but, dang it, they pulled me in.  I loved this book. I wouldn't want my little cousins reading it until they're at least 15, but I doubt I can stop them.
I was late jumping on the Hunger Games band wagon. In today's society the last thing I wanted to do was read about people killing each other we get enough of that in real life! I picked this up out of boredom one evening and couldn't put it down. The characters are so relatable you find yourself rooting for them and crying with them. Afterwards I had to rush out and buy the next book I just couldn't wait to see what happened next. I will be rereading this series for years to come.
I read this book about one month ago. It's absolutely amazing! I don't regret buying this book at all. Honestly it made me laugh and cry. During school when I would read it I'd laugh out loud and people must have thought that I was weird or something. It was a sad book but I didn't cry in public only in my room. The Hunger Games was the third boook I've ever read in my entire life and it made me love reading. Just but this book you won't regret (hopefully) but that's just me :)
The Hunger Games was suggested to me by a young adult and the book is well-suited for that age group.  The strong, female lead character is someone you quickly learn to root for and care about.  The dystopian world of the Games gets explored more in the following books.  The best part of the story is how rebellion can be started by the simplest and most innocent of acts by the most unlikely of persons.  A very simple and quick read that is entertaining and well worth your time.
This is the best series I have ever read. You need to read them, you NEED to. I was kind of skeptical at first due to a description that totally undersells it. I decided to try them out and I didn't regret it at all. Not for one moment did I regret reading these books. I thougt it  would just be a bunch of kids killing each other but there is a love story somehow weaved in that makes this book all the better. Buy it. You will talk aout it for weeks and love it. i certainly did.
I had no expectations going in because I had never read this type of series before. I love Suzanne's style of writing. She makes you feel like you are right there with the characters. I had a clear picture of everything in the book before the movie came out. I think the movie did a good job of bringing the novel to life. This novel is fast paced and never bored me. I am an adult. I enjoyed it. I don't care if it is supposed to be for teens or young adults. I loved this series.
From all the hype about Hunger Games, one might expect this book to rate among futuristic classics.  It does not, at least for me.  Don't get me wrong, it was a fairly good read.  The author does a pretty good job of making you feel overall contempt for the "Capital" and sympathy for residents of the "Districts".  Unfortunately, that's about all there is except for the underlying development of a teenage romantic stress.  Reasonably entertaining - but not really my cup of tea.
I (twenty-eight years old) could not put this book down. It is not for young readers only, but for anyone who can open a book! After starting, you get so involved with the characters and the world that when you close your eyes you are immidiately taken into their world. There is not too much going on that you get lost, but enough side plots and mini stories that teach you who the people are and build the story. Read the Hunger Games (trilogy) and let your imagination run wild!
I'm almost embarrassed by how many times I've gone back and reread this book. I devoured it in less than a day, and then devoured the next two books in a day and a half. In a cruel world where children must kill or be killed, Collins creates very real characters you love, root for, and cry over. Katniss Everdeen is easily one of the best young adult lit characters ever written--a strong female character who can be stacked up against some of literature's best classic heroines.
When I started the hunger games, I wasn't very impressed and I was actually kind of disappointed. I had heard so much about the whole trilogy from friends and my expectations were very high. But as I read on, I realized why people raved about it so much: it was deep. It leaves you with so many questions that are ultimately unanswerable. This isn't another book about the controlling powers of a different government. It's so much more. Just read it. And you'll know what I mean.
I confess that I had no interest in this series before I saw the movie.  I had no interest in the movie, only enough curiosity that I watched it one evening when there was nothing else to do. Then I was absolutely hooked! I HAD to read the book after that, and it was all that I had hoped for and more! I finally understood things that I had been wondering about and filled in spaces that made me love the story even more! I'm so excited to read the next two books in the series!
I love YA fiction...and I've read quite a bit of it.  Believe me, when I say this is the best trilogy I have read in years.  I'm not usually a fan of post-apocalyptic future books, but the world building is so delicious in this, I couldn't put it down.  After devouring all three in this series, I was left with a sense of complexity and finality.  She wrote the best "last line" of any book I've ever read.  Well done.  I'll certainly be looking for future books by this author.
A friend of mine has been telling me to read this series for a long time now. Well, I finally picked up The Hunger Games, and I am kicking myself for putting it off for so long!  What a great read! I read the first book in two days- I just couldn't put it down. I bought Catching Fire two days ago and just ate it up. Again, I couldn't bring myself to put it down! It's addicting to say the least. I absolutely recommend this series! I'm on my way out to buy Mockingjay now. :)
I read The Hunger Games in two days!  I read every free chance I got!  I was originally avoiding this book because it sounded like it like a stupid premise for a book and I don't read futuristic books.  My only suggestion is to read it before the movies come out.  I made the mistake of going on IMDB to check out the movie and it ruined the characters for me.  Suzanne Collins paints a wonderful picture of the characters... Let your imagination dream them up... Not Hollywood.
I bought this book at the suggestion of a friend. While I at first found nothing special about the writing itself, Collins has an amazing depth to her characterisation. Seeing Katniss's world through her mind - rather than just through her eyes - makes everything seem much more real and harsh.  The writing itself gets better a few chapters in without you noticing, so the book melds seamlessly with your imagination.  I highly recommend reading this book.
This is one of the best books I have ever read.  The plot, along with the incredibly descriptive writing style of Collins, pulled me into this book.  I spent two afternoons reading this book and the next, Catching Fire.  I couldn't stop until they were finished.  I actually read the third book in about a day and a half, but it is definitely not as good as the first book.  Nonetheless, I was sad when the story ended and I had to move on with life.  This is a must read book!
Yowza! This book really IS as good as everyone says it is. Why-oh-why in the world did I wait so doggone long to get around to reading it?! I dunno, but if YOU haven't read it yet, I highly recommend it. It isn't at all what I expected; it's much much better. Sincere thanks to all those folks who told me I "had" to read it. (They were right!) Can't wait to read the other books in the series. This book deserves every single rave review it's received, and then some.
I have been trying to avoid the hunger games trilogy because of the killing of other children. But because the movie catching fire came out, I resolved to read the books before I see the movies. And Collins sucks me in from the illegal hunting to the heartwarming family story to the hunger games themselves! If you don't like romance mixed with the need to live, then too bad, so sad!!!! The hunger games are great and I'd recommend for anyone who is interested in adventure.
A beautiful well-written book.  Good writing good characters, good plot. I'm not a young adult, far from it, but I loved the book.  I had already seen the movie so I knew the plot.  Even so, the suspense carried me along and I couldn't put it down.  The book varies from the movie a little.  In the book, Katniss is the hero.  In the movie, they gave Petra more of a chance to be a hero also.  I guess the movie wanted to attract boys to the movie as well as girls.
I'm not a big fiction reader, but when I picked this new book series up from Suzanne Collins I couldn't put it down. She creates a fascinating world set about 100 years into the future of America that is scarily believable. She gets at the core of the human character and expose it for all its strengths and weaknesses. You'll want to read the whole three book series however I would only give the 3rd book four stars and it doesn't stand on its own as an independent novel.
This was a well written story.  The fact that I saw the movie first took away some of the suspense because the movie plot pretty closely followed the book.  What came out in the book much better than in the movie was the conflict Katniss had about who to believe and who was trying to manipulate her for their own gain.  The message about standing up for what is right and daring to challenge the status quo was a good one.  I look forward to reading the rest of the series
This book is different than any other book I have ever read. I dont think that this genre has been thoroughly explored, especially not like this. The plot ideas are what make it so interesting, its originality just shines through the pages. Katniss and Peeta are fully formed characters, who compliment each others personalities very well. This book leaves nothing to be desired. Can't wait for Catching Fire! (September 1st)    Need more book recommendations?   [...]
Great book, well written.  Makes you want to read the sequels.  Very descriptive and able to picture what is happening.  Had heard from a lot of people that read it with good reviews-I always prefer to watch the movie then read the book because often the detail and story are better in the book.  Haven't seen the movie yet so will see what my thoughts are on it (had a friend that read the book then saw the movie and said movie was nothing like book, but I will see).
I love this movie and have watched it several times.  It is slightly different than the book, but close enough.  I found this to be very enjoyable and if you have older children they may enjoy it, too.  I recommend this for those who like a little of every thing, family relationships, young love, trying to figure out who you love, not really knowing where the story line may be going, action and adventure.  This has a little for every  one.  Like I said, I love it!
I finally got around to reading this book when I flew home to OH. Wowza! Amazing! I fell into the realm of the Hunger games real fast and now I'm hooked. Yes, its disturbing that kids kill kids, but honestly, that is not what this book is about. Its about hope, determination, and believing in yourself. I just saw the movie with my sisters, 2 nieces, and nephew (3 of them have read it) and it was great. I lent this book to a friend and she loved it too. go read it!
I had a nagging feeling that I'm too old to be reading a novel where a teenager is the protagonist, but boy was I wrong. It is completely engrossing, and it has all of the qualities of a great story: suspense, interesting characters, intriguing plot. I highly recommend this story to everyone- you won't be sorry and you'll have a hard time putting it down.  I now am interested in reading some of the stories that may have inspired this book, such as Battle Royale.
I starts out fast paced and stays that way. not only fast paced but i couldn't wait for what was coming next. ms. collins put it all together very well and i can't wait to read the second and third. katniss and peeta are wonderfully developed characters. all of them really were developed very nicely and the story just flowed. a very good futuristic suspense that should make us all think about the "capital" controling everything. you won't be sorry with this one!!!
My15 year old daughter begged me to read this series so she could talk about it with me. I agreed, to be nice. But I had never expected to be totally captured by the story. I love the characters and the way the author writes. The story keeps me on the edge of my seat. I have another book to read for my book club which I have not been able to read because of getting addicted to this series. When its my turn to pick the book for my book club, I am picking this one.
I honestly can say I loved every single page of this book, my only complaint being that I finished it so quickly.  For two days I drove everyone at my work and my husband crazy talking about every little detail in this book.  I have recommended it to everyone and find myself reading it a second time after only a week of having finished it.  The storyline is uniquely disturbing and I honestly can not wait until I have the chance to read the rest of this Trilogy.
Katniss Everdeen is a strong and likeable character in spite of her flaws.  This series does an excellent job with character development and symbolism.  The Hunger Games is an imaginative story that highlights the darkness of humanity as well as the underlying hope for it.  This is a captivating series of books that has left an empty place for me to fill, now that I've finished all three.  It's an excellent read and I can't wait for the movie coming this spring!
My 2d favorite series.  A book that once I read the first time, had to read again.  A book you didn't want to end.  The characters are real and you can relate to them.  The situations and settings are believeable--you immmediately, put yourself right in to the time and place of the book.  It's got everything:  romance (of course, but not smarmy at all, adventure, suspense and it has a moral.  I've read the series two times!  Suzanne Collins weaves a great tale.
I saw the movies before I read the books, so this was aggravating sometimes because there are almost no surprises.  But this book was really epic.  I can't wait for me to finish them.  This is my new favorite story.  It has romantic and depressing parts, and I love romantic stories.  But it has more than just romantic parts.  It is so gripping, you need to read it.  And there are some surprises, but I still wish I had read the books before I watched the movie.
I enjoyed reading this book even if the target demographic audience is teenagers. The story is well developed and the characters are presented in a way that anyone can relate to them - young or older - and you want to see where the story will take them. Reading the book is helpful in understanding the movie - the movie can stand on it's own but without reading the book you lose a lot of the background from the book that make the story so much more interesting.
I really liked this story, I just wish the sequel wasn't so expensive. For a Young Adult book it does contain many mature themes, (and no, I don't mean sex), which I thought was good. Most kids don't want books that treat them like idiots. As for people who don't believe a world like this could happen, just look at our world today, the people inside the DC Beltway really have little connection to the outside world, nor do they or the media elite understand it.
This book it one of the best books I have read in the past few years. I couldn't put it down and finished it in a few days. The premises of the book may seem brutal, but the growth that the main characters go through is so rewarding. I recommend this book for young readers as well as old. I think it bridges the age gap (similar to Harry Potter). Can't wait for the movie to come out and I'm anxiously waiting for the 2nd and 3rd books to arrive on my doorstep.
Suzanne Collins has exceeded my expectations for the series. I didn't want to put my Kindle down while I was reading it. I would love if Collins made a few books with the Hunger Games theme. My favorite moment in each book is when both Katniss and Peeta realize that they really do love each other. Katniss's story has really brought me closer to myself as a girl and as a lover. One character really did stand out to me. Effie. She reminds me much of my friend.
I did not want to read this as I think the "dog eat dog" mentality of this world is ungodly.  I was surprised by other people who liked it so I gave it a shot.  The storyline snaps you up immediately.  The remnant of good in an otherwise evil society reminds me that hope springs eternal.  I think it is ok for young readers.  Maybe it will help some of them cling to what is good.  What remains in the two following books may change my mind.  We'll see.
I have always said that I am not a "fantasy" novel fan. I must have been wrong, because I loved this novel- right along with the remainder of the trilogy. I enjoyed the author's ability to make me feel the hunger...the fear...the angst, etc. that I felt for the characters. Definitely not for just the YA group. I didn't want it to end and once it did, I felt empty...just for a second...and then I proceeded to "whispernet" the next one straight to my Kindle.
I couldn't put this book down - just like the other Hunger Games books!!  She has a way of writing that keeps you gripping to the page, wanting to skip the next paragraph because you can't read fast enough!  I bought the set of three, and passed them on to friends who felt the same way - her writing is contagious...you start dreaming and thinking of the hunger games and how to fix the situations created.  They become real to you and anyone who reads them!
Wow...this book was a part of my wife's reading group and was recommended, so I gave it a shot. In brief, if an infinite number of monkeys were typing at infinite computers, they'd produce this book in under five minutes. The writing is juvenile and the attempt at creating a more adult themed content makes the book very predictable. If you liked this, read Phillip Pullman's Dark Material saga for more of the same. Honestly, some of my least liked books.
I love this book! I rated it a 5 star because this book is not just romance it is also an adventure book. This is my first time reading Hunger Games although I have seen the movie I know the movie and the book have little in common. I recommend this book and series to anybody, anywhere. I can tell you right now that I will definitely be reading this book and others like it again and again. I don't think I will ever get tired of reading the Hunger Games.
I have to say this book is pure Genius! I mean I could not put it down! It is one of the best books i have every read. When i first heard about it i was a little iffy but then started reading it and realized it wasn't about the killing, sure that played a major role but really its about the life of Katniss its just, not words acan explain it all! You will be thinking about this book for months! I recommend that you read it! you will not be disapointed!
This was one of those books that I had a hard time putting down once I started reading it.  The characters are living in a post apocalyptic culture where the governing authorities believe that children should be sacrificed in order to maintain order and intimidate the local people into submissions.  The adventure and intrigue are so engaging that even if your'e not a fan of science fiction I think you will still have a hard time putting this book down.
I read The Hunger Games for a project at school after my teacher strongly recommended it. As I read it I found it easy to read and pretty action filled. The Hunger games is a good story, but I found some parts too slow and dry. I also didn't like the characters even though I wanted too. I think that the whole hunger games idea is brilliant but I didn't like the way it was written. I started this book wanting to love it but I ended up only liking it.
I could not put these books down and read all 3 in about 4 days.  This book series is amazing.  Perfect action and adventure, plus the struggle of life, death and love?  It's great.  I think the series could have gone into a 4th book since it felt like it was rushed towards the end to hurry up and "finish" the book, but it's not that I didn't know where all the main characters ended up and that their lives were happy.....Overall this is a must read!
I put off reading this book for months. But my friends and coworkers all pushed me to read them. SOOO glad I did! Now we have a almost everyone at my work reading these books. Everyone says that same thing about it...Amazing, phenomenal, epic!!!  This entire series is absolutely amazing! I bought all three books and finished them all in less than a week. The books are so engaging and honest that it is hard to put them down. Definitely worth a look!
I stayed up till 6am because this is one of those stories that seems alive. I didn't dare put it down for fear the story might go on without me. Days later I can not stop thinking about Katniss and Peeta. This book leaves you with a pit in your gut. The characters are so relatable and the setting so horrendous it is easy to wish yourself into this novel in order to make your own allies and...targets. Five stars Suzanne Collins, I'll be waiting for the next book (while my fingernails grow back!)
I hadn't planned on reading this book. I'd heard about it for the longest time but it didn't sound like something I'd enjoy. I finally broke down and bought it and have to say "wow". The first time I picked it up, I read more than half the book in one sitting. I have to say this is one of the more engaging books I've read--ever! Unique style, riveting, honestly a great read. The movie doesn't give it justice! Now, gladly, on to book 2...
This was the second time I red The Hunger Games and I still love this this book. Like people always say, the book is always better than the movie. I would 100% agree with that. Don't get me wrong the movie is good but the book has so much more information and involves you. Reading for the second time I couldn't put it down again. All I have to say is if you haven't red this book get on it along with Catching Fire and Mocking Jay. Amazing books!
Watched the movie first and I was not impressed at all. There were a lot of thing that I didn't understand. After a very long time I finally gave in to several people assuring me that the book was better, of course why wouldn't it be. In short, I read all 3 books in 6 days. Now I feel like I'm lost without more books. Not that it was confusing, but that I was completely lost in them like they were apart of me and now they're gone.  We'll done.
I loved this book.  I could not put it down, and honestly, can not wait to read the other two books in the trilogy.  I would have bought the whole trilogy if I would have realized how exciting this book was going to be.  I will also say that I recently saw the movie, and was quite happy with it as well.  The author did a wonderful job telling the story from the main character's point of view.  Again, I can not wait to read the other two books.
After hearing what seemed tons of raving on a radio station about how great this book was and looking at the reviews I decided to just try the sample of this book - its free for kindle users so why not. I wasnt expecting to like it but was VERY wrong. After about the 2nd chapter I could hardly put it down. In just a couple days I have finished the amazing book and am downloading the others. I HIGHLY reccommend you reading this book. Very good.
I admit, being 27, I felt a tad silly picking up this book (at least Harry Potter was thick - it felt adult).  I have read it twice in full and I have returned to re-read parts more than a few times.  Incredible.  The main character is sparsely, yet realistically written.  She is both known and unknown to us, and to herself, as so many are at sixteen.  The book is not gory by any means and the Hunger Games are over after the first book, so it will be interesting to see what happens next.
I could not put this book down!  It was wonderfully written and allowed the reader to really get into this future world and go on this journey into the Hunger Games. Even though I know this book is aimed at a young adult audience I got it because I heard so many good things about it so even though I am an adult I could really get into it and enjoyed it thoroughly so if you haven't got on the Hunger Games bandwagon yet I recommend that you do!
Everybody I work with has read, is reading, or waiting to read this book. It was good, a little dark and twisted, but kept me curious about what would happen next. I will read the 2nd book, Catching Fire, but still don't quite get all the "hoopla". I suppose if I were a teen or younger adult, my opinion would be a little different. It kind of reminds me of Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome, meets The Condemned, meets the kid tribe in Peter Pan!
The book get's you hooked from the first page and the storytelling is at times excellent. I finished this book in half a day, but was left with the feeling that I just read some high school short story. The unfolding of events turned childish and the characters just seemed to have no real depth.  Mostly an entertaining read, but perhaps I have been too spoiled by character portrayals from authors such as Robert Jordan and George Martin.
I held out on reading this book.  First because it is Young Adult, so I thought I wouldn't find it interesting, and then because it became as big as Twilight, and I was afraid it would be...less than good.  But when I saw it available on the Kindle Owner's Lending Library, I thought, "What the heck?"  I was hooked almost instantly.  If you haven't read this book yet, for whatever reason, get it now.  It was great!
A co-worker had recommended this book to me.  I thought the premise was very different, and I enjoyed the fact that the lead character was female.  This book had everything, action, bloodshed, politics, romance, you name it.  This is a quick read for adults and it's definitely a great book to get young readers hooked.  I bought the trilogy for my cousin who wasn't a fan of reading but within a month he had read the whole trilogy!!
My 11 year old granddaughter loves to read.....I gave her 24 books for Christmas and this is one of her favorites....she just look up reading at 10 and we can't get her out of her books.  I have read that reading is the #1 stress reducer so it looks like she will have a wonderful life with her passion for reading.  She finished the Harry Potter series and we got her the collector edition.  She likes reading "real books" and kindle.
I loved this book. I loved this whole series. I was seriously upset when I finished it because I was out of books! I'll admit the relationship drama is a little heavy handed and the book is very gory at times, but I found myself forgiving it again and again. I lost a great deal of good sleep while reading this book because I could not put it down.  Wonderful for anyone that likes fast moving adventure, dystopia, action, fantasy, or sci fi.
I loved this story! Katniss is a true heroine! The "reality tv show" idea truly reflects the sad voyeuristic obsession in our present culture, and it takes it to the extremes - a once-per-year fight to the death for the nation's youth. The book is a winner from the beginning, but once the "Game" begins, it's very hard to put down! Katniss' defiant nature is not only what makes her endearing, but it's what helps her through her whole experience in the Game. I look forward to book two!
Some people don't like how long it takes to get to the actual Games, but what happens before effects what happens during them and helps you understand it.  I suggest this Book to Young Adults - Adults.  I choose five stars, because of the fact that Suzanne Collins captured this image of the most intriguing dystopia I have read yet; and that it flows together perfectly well enough that it makes you want to keep reading.  - NMC
This book was recommended to me and I am grateful that I took this suggestion. The Hunger Games immediately interested me, I was engrossed and I couldn't put it down. The story of Katniss and her death defying trials and her frank views made me root for her. The people that love her and root for her make her more sympathetic and made me love her also.  I recommend this book and the remaining two books in this series to everyone I know.
The Hunger Games came highly recommended to me by a friend.  I bought the first book and had to pry myself away from all three of them, so good!  These books seemed to flawlessly touch so many subjects; politics, love, family, survival, power, trust, courage... Gosh, I just loved them and wish I could find more books to lose myself into!  If you are wondering whether or not to invest your time in The Hunger Games, the answer is Yes!
this book was just soooo amazing.... i had watched the movie before i had gotten ahold of the book.... and after reading, i've noticed that the movie had left out the last part and a wjole freaking character!!! and also how, tje mutants were the other tributes.... i have to say.... this is one of those books, you just cant set down.... well i hadlto because my tjing had to cjarge.... but, this book is definitely magically amazing!!!!
I read this book after my teenage daughter raved about it. I was a bit skeptical, but by the end of the first page was completely hooked. This book is by no means simply for the "young adult" market, and those readers who have steered clear of the book for that reason are making a huge mistake. This is an exceptional book that tells a great and harrowing tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat through the very last sentence.
I must admit, I'm not much of a reader. I'm trying to make myself do better but I find it hard to keep interested long enough to finish a book of any length. I  am not exaggerating when I say that this book held my attention from the minute I started it, till I finished it. When I was not reading it, I thought about it, excited to see what happens next. It is a great, great book. It immediately grabs you and holds on till the end.
This book was a page turner. I found that I liked the author's pace, and how you didn't have every agonizing detail explained when trying to describe a scene (3 paragraphs on the shrubs, etc). Many critic's review didn't like the beleiveable-factor. This book is set in the future, and if you think about it, between mankind's history with gladiators and concentration camps, this type of story-line isn't too far fetched. Great read.
I'll summarize quickly since there's plenty of reviews. The writing is very, very basic. This is not a book you'll have to analyze, or look for symbols, or anything like that. The book spells out everything you need to know, you don't need to close read at all. The pace is very fast, yet it's enjoyable. I'm a reader who prefers deeper novels (Crime and Punishment is my favorite) but I still enjoyed it. Worth it for the price 100%!
Collins writes a story that you on the edge of your seat at the last sentence of Chapter 1!  Being a mom of four daughters this book completely tugged at my heart strings and so easily put their faces on a few characters in this story.  Very emotional and you can see every frame as if you are watching the games right along with the audience of The Hunger Games.  I will definitely be looking for Book 2 of this series! Well done!!!!
Nothing to dislike,the movie holds true to the basis of the book which is grand. I have read the series three times now, and I wait with bated breath for the third movie don't let me down the last book is spectacular! Please I begun do not F It up like they did the beautiful creatures, and make me hate u for it. Nothing worse than a bad movie from a truly great book series. The second movie also as good and better than the first!
Absoluty, irrevocably, and compleatly hooked on this book. Between the plots, the characters, and the awesomeness of the story is unbeleveable and will stand to be an all time clasic in years to come. I have to say one of my favorite thing about this book (when i say favorite i mean top 10) is Katniss, she is loyal, protective, and can fight for herself. I am not obsessed but I do love this book and the other two on ther series.
I dont find The hunger games perfect, but theres one thing I have to congratulate Suzanne Collins collins for. She can keep a reader turning pages from beginning to end. The fact that in every end of a chapter theres a twist that makes want to keep reading is excellent. Besides, the whole story of the book is very original. Being tired of Vampires, Wizards and the like, The hunger games wins in originality.  Highy recommended!
This book reminded my of why I grew up loving to read. By no mean is it great literature, but it's fun and I was able to get great mental pictures of their world. I could actually see my fourteen-year-old self in the arena and imagine how I'd have stacked up. I couldn't put it down until I knew what happened to Katniss. If you're over the age of 20 remember that this is a book for teenagers and let the teenager inside enjoy it.
I put off reading The Hunger Games because the whole idea of teens battling for their lives was just too repulsive to me.  But, after all the favorable reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  Immediately you are drawn into the main characters and begin to care about what happens to them.  It was hard to put down and I was sorry for the book to end.  I have bought the next two and am engrossed in the second one.
I don't usually read these kinds of books (fantasy, sci-fi, suspense) but I had to read The Hunger Games with all of the hype! I am a preservice teacher and this series is so popular with young adults and I can see why. I won't give anything away, but the books are simply brilliant. They are painful to read and truly heartbreaking, but so worth it! The series shows the effects of war on a people and the true cost of freedom.
This was a great read! I wasn't sure I would like it but once I got started I couldn't put it down. I read it in a matter of days which is highly unusual for me. The character development is excellent and makes you really care about Katniss, Gale and Peeta. I was hooked and immediately started the next in the series after reading this one. I'm looking forward to the movie next year and hope they do a good job of adapting it.
This book rocked. I read it before I saw the movie. It was equally as good, in my opinion. I think Katniss is one of my favorite characters, and that's saying a lot. I have strong opinions about which guy she should end up with, but that's another story. I loved the action scenes too, during the actual "Hunger Games". I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a great story. It keeps you going right through to the end.
I wasn't  sure how I would like this book, I knew that I loved the movie but would I love the book, and my answer is YES! They might say it's a younger persons book but I'm 60 and I enjoyed every page,from beginng to end. I can't wait for the next!  I was lucky enough to have Amazon Prime, which I also highly recommend and I'm not a employee, so I got it and  next two for free and can't wait for the next two. Happy  Reading
This book,has given me alot to think about. The Hunger Games is offcially the most a-w-e-s-o-m-e book EVER!! Better than anything you can imagine. I love everything about it. Amazing plot, characters,drama, romance,excitement! I' cant wait to read the last book. It has to be shipped to be so it'll take a while for it to come sadly :( BUT! AWESOME*EST BOOK EVEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :D Buy it, read it and love it :D
I waited a long time to read this book thinking it was a book for teenagers.  Finally I put it on my "summer reading list".  All I can say is WOW!  I'm usually not a fan of science fiction of any kind but this book was like riding a roller coaster!  Yes it's an easy read and entertaining but if you look a little below the surface there are actually some rather profound concepts discussed.  I thoroughly enjoyed it!
Great read!  This book is a perfect example that a story does not need to have over a dozen very complex and intertwining story lines to be good. It has an plot that is easy to follow (I do realise that this is a novel for young adults) and the story really hold  your attention. It took a little while to get past the first person writing style but that is my only complaint. I loved it and can't wait to start the next one.
I read this book quickly. It kept me captivated from the start with all the adventure. The ending was a bit boring and the book is somewhat predictable as everything somehow seems to work out for the main character. Its not as enthralling as Twilight or True Blood but very close to it. Defnitely worth buying however I wont be buying the second book as this one didnt make me crave for more really. Nice for a weekend read.
I saw the movie first then decided to read the book. I could not put this book down once I started and it really filled in the gaps from the movie. Suzanne Collins is a fantastic writer! It only took me an hour to realise I had to get the second and third book and I finished them all in a week. I would highly recommend The Hunger Games but make sure you have a clear schedule as once you start you won't be able to stop!
So, I decided to grab this book beacuse well, hey why not? I thought it would be another one of those "eh" books that you just read because you have it. But Suzanne Collins really did something special with this book. Not just that but as well as my Kindle Reader also just gave my P.O.V. a much better expierence. Get this book please, it's just amazing to the point I shoud write a review! Thanks for your time.
This book was a definite must read! I couldn't put it down and you just fall in love with the characters! Also it gives you a weird perception of society and the rights and wrongs and what exactly a society should be able to do and how much you're willing to risk. The girl on fire was a character you can't help but empathize with and the details make all the characters come to life! It'll get your imagination working!
I'm late to the party but glad I came. Saw the film but never got around to reading the book, till now. An easy and engrossing read- so much so that I read 280 pages of the 370 in a few hours during my transcontinental flight to Ireland! I'm a grown woman probably well outside the age group for whom this is written for, but I loved it. I'm ready to start Catching Fire and see what happens to Katniss and Peeta next!
My teenage grandson suggested that I read this trilogy - and I was so pleasantly surprised to find that I really enjoyed the story as well as the writing style. The premise is horrifying - a world very changed from the one we know today - but we also thought Orwell's "1984" was a stretch of the imagination, and now we see parts of it in our daily lives. I am looking forward to seeing the movie version of this book.
Very good and I hate all the people who just watch the movies and say, "wow another teen love story," because it's not. It is so much more than that. So if you would get your act together and not judge a book by its movie or by things other people have said, that would be so much better. Honestly it's the thing I hate most in the world: people who make opinions with no information. So yeah, this book is fantastic.
Great book. The action drama and thought of Panem's existence was amazing. A real thought out story, when I saw the movie I wanted to read the book too. Can't wait to read and watch Catching Fire then Mockingjay, my favourite parts was whenever Cato broke from the trees and got the crap beaten out out of him or the ending of the book or beginning.  I rate 10 stars if you like this book read Catching Fire
The Hunger Games is a stunning tour de force that sweeps you away to another time and place. The author is an expert at creating such a fast pace that hours pass before you look up from the book. My only criticisms are her use of the first person present tense, of which I'm not a fan, and the strong similarity between this book and the famous Japanese movie, Battle Royale, which appeared years before this trilogy.
The movie moved me enough to read the books, I read all three before seeing the second movie, glad I did. The book so easily spelled out the trials of a suppressed society where life is not valued and anything goes. The victim brainwashed into accepting a fate and those that do what they have to in order to survive. War has horrible parts of struggle that the book brought you into.  Just to say the movie did too.
After starting a career, it's sometimes hard to find time to devote to a book, but I didn't feel this way when I started the Hunger Games. With every page, you need with such clarity and speed because you have to get to the next page.  Suzanne Collins wrote a wonderful book. I just started Catching Fire, and it is amazing as well.  If you haven't read this book, please do. You won't be sorry.
Amazing story..Very detailed..Very graphic. Just finished the 3rd in this trilogy.All three books were very hard to put down...This author keeps you wanting to read just a little more before you put it away..Many days, I would come back from break or lunch at work a little late...just wanted to read more...My bf is now reading the 2nd book. My daughter has read all three. Its Survivor with their lives. Amazing.
Once i picked this book up i couldn't put it down!! The whole story made me actually feel like i was there!! The action created vivid pictures in your head and the whole love affair made you want more. A awsome book that teaches you the true meaning of the word determination. You didn't want this to end and it leaves you craving for more. An action, romantic, and dramatic read that you won't want to miss out on.
This book got me on my feet and slapped me in the face(a good slap.)  I loved this book so much and how it caught my attention and made me want to read more. Katniss is a strong character and easy to relate to.  She knows how to think and act for herself.  No spoilers here, just read it for yourself.  I was sad to see it end, but happy that it soon continues.  I can't wait to see what happens in Catching Fire!!!
This series is *trying* to be in the same vein as 1984, Brave New World, Lord of the Flies, Battle Royale, and Jennifer Goverment. However, it flops as far as execution. It is obvious that the goal of Hunger games, like the previously mentioned books, is attempting to create a dystopian world that is based off of a flaw of currently existing government, and set to highlight this flaw.  There is a major defect though in the way the book pursues this....  It never shows any flaw with the original system.  With 1984, the problem is "A government that views it as okay to monitor it's citizens' loyalty above all else."  With Brave New world, the problem is "Government feels its okay to make decisions for you for your own good."  With Lord of the Flies, the problem is "We can't trust that *everyone* will have basic human goodness."  With Battle Royale, the problem is, "Blind loyalty to government leads to a government that doesn't feel responsible."  With Jennifer Government, the problem is, "Reducing regulation on corporations and government size eventually results in corporations ruling as if they were the government."  With Hunger games it's vauge and hazy at best, the best summary being that "Having a centralized government is bad except when you have tiered centralized governments, in which case only the top one is bad, and if you get rid of the top one somehow the 'more local' centralized government will somehow be okay and somehow always has been and will be free of corruption, even if it is a centralized government in and of itself" ... yea. Kinda screwed up. Basically, the author is trying to make a huge story-line based case in this book about how "Federal government is evil* (insert spooky 'oooooo" here) but somehow regional governments are completely fine and good, without ever addressing the fact that they're effectively the same thing with just a difference of scale, and without really pointing out any differences between the two.  There's no valuable message here. Not vital lesson for making our world a better place, no things you have to really watch out for, no useful cautionary tale...  It's just ... "ooooo, federal government is scary.... ooooo.... feel scared!".  Frankly, after encountering this piece of tripe, I'm more worried about this book and the fear-mongering it will cause than the federal government.  Also, one thing that REALLY, REALLY, irked me about this book... especially since its supposed to be based on our world.... corporations and big business just somehow magically disappeared. We have these huge bloated behemoth of organizations in our world before the events of the book, and in Hunger games.. they just... aren't.  There's no mention anywhere. No mention what happened to the corporations, no mention of who the big players sided with in the war (capitol or regions). There's not a single mention of who bribed who, where those corporations that exist outside of North America are doing today (or really, most other governments at all for the most part)... it's as if somehow some of the biggest players in socio-economics... in a story about socio-economics... just somehow... aren't. In a story and setting to where the positives and negatives of such organizations SHOULD have made a HUGE impact on the development of the story, and had an impact on the world getting to its present state..... nothing. Not even a whisper. Not even a nod of the head saying "yea, they're still doing their thing" or "government declared immenient domain on them"... not.. just... poof... gone. Never happened.  Even Battle Royale, which in almost identical to this book in many regards (except that it was written in Japan about China, Battle Royale came first, at least makes mention of this stuff, saying that the government closed its borders to all such things. Here.... it tries to pretend that such things never existed and somehow don't apply to the situation at hand.  These aspects change what was obviously meant to be a dystopian cautionary tale into just a piece of smelly steaming propaganda. And like all other piles of steaming s***, deserves to be scooped up and flushed down the toilet.
I chose a five star rating because this book keeps me on edge and I never wanna stop reading it. it makes me feel like I could've survive possibly with all of Katniss's tricks. I also can't stand that Peeta doesn't understand how Katniss feels. But I love this book I have read it many many times. I hope u guys keep reading the series because you won't be able to live without knowing what happens. HUNGER GAMES:)
I just finished it and with out a doubt it was the fastest book I have read. I had to know what was going to happen next every moment was thrilling and breath taking. I never knew what to expect next, somethings hit me like a ton of brick and others left me wanting to know why. I laughed, I cried, and I chewed off my finger nails. It was brutal and bloody and yet I never lost my sympathy for the main character.
Hunger Games is one of the best written books I have ever read.  Suzanne Collins truley knows how to grab you attention and put your mind into that "whats next" gear.  I could not put this book, Catching Fire and Mockingjay down until I had read them.  Wonderful plot, very engrossing and a stroy that makes you wonder....could this really happen??  One of the best trilogies I have ever had the privilage to read.
This book is told in the first person, which is so refreshing for an adventure.  I thought the author was a gifted story teller.  She makes you feel what Katniss was feeling and describes each scene as if she were really there.  The movie does not come close to capturing the emotion or characters of Katniss, Peeta, or Gale.  Collins developers the characters so well you know them, like old friends.  Well done!
This book draws you in right from the beginning.  It is a very quick read but full of action and adventure.  The Hunger games are a horrible game put on by the capitol (of what was once America), and Katniss must fight to survive.  I barely put it down and am now almost done with Catching Fire.  So if you are looking for something quick to read that will keep your interest peaked, I recommend this book/series.
This is one of the best books I have ever read! The writing is so captivating and every sentence left me clinging for more. The story itself is so different than a lot of books I've read and the suspense kept me going. The characters are great, they feel complete and you get just the right amount of information at just the right times. I would highly recommend this book, and I cannot wait for the second book!
I started reading this book when I saw the previews for the movies. My niece needed to read it for school, so we set off to read it together. Definitely a page turner, literally left hanging at ends of chapter forcing me to continue reading. Which at sometimes was difficult due to time. But that would NEVER stop me from recommending it. But I warn you, you will have to read book two due to the ending of one!
These books are one of the best series I have read ever. I could not put them down. I read all 3 and turned right around and read them again right away. I have never done that with any other books ever. Even Harry Potter which I love I read them about every 2 or 3 years again. I really don't think I can put into words how great this is. I suggest this to everyone to read or if they don't read see the movie.
Wow! What an amazing book. One of the best books I read in 2010. I look forward to the sequels.  This book was full of all the stuff I love, family and love, loss, survival, underdogs winning, a love connection, personal/individual growth and most of all, lucky breaks.  There are so many reviews on this book that I don't want to rehash everything, but I look forward to the next chapter of Katniss's journey.
From the first page, I was drawn into this story. I couldn't put it down, so thank goodness it wasn't too long or I would have missed out on a lot of sleep.  Suzanne Collins did an amazing job of telling the story through Katniss's eyes. It is not stop and full of energy. When I finally finished it, I was still up thinking about it for some time. I can't wait for book two to come out.  A must read for sure!
This is such an engaging, fun, and easy read.  I was captivated after the first page and couldn't put it down!  Collins did an amazing job balancing the brutality of what these Hunger Games entail and the interweaving of the human emotions involved in the main characters.  You instantly feel collected to Katniss and fall in love with Peeta.  I bought the 2nd and 3rd book a few chapters into this book!
Great book for the post-apocalyptic society fans out there! The plot is extremely thought out and the entire book works out like a puzzle. No endings or twist that make you feel like the author wrote herself into a corner and took a cheesy way out or anything. Also, does have a touch of love story but just enough to make it interesting and give the reader some relief from the books brutality. Great book!
I had seen the movies before I decided to read the books and they're amazingly similar but different at the same time. It is a great story, very original with little to no grammatical mistakes where most books have a few. Suzanne Collins deserves the attention and adoration her books have received from fans everywhere and now she can add one more person to that count. Can't wait to read the second book.
This series of books is amazing! I love the whole plot and there is rarely a dull moment. It's interesting to watch Katniss Everdeen change throughout the book, through her tragedies and her difficult love. It leaves you thinking, trying to guess what will happen next. Truth is, you'll probably be wrong; about almost everything you think will happen. Read this book, and prepare to expect the unexpected.
I watched the movie first then I borrowed the book because I didn't know if it was "my kind of book" after reading it I purchased it and the next two in the series because I wanted all three in my library so I could reread them again and again.  The book went along with the movie but with more detail and explaination as to the whys and what fors of the movie. "The Hunger Games" is well worth the price.
My husband and me both had heard about this book and saw the early previews for the movie. We thought the book was geared towards young adults so we did not think about reading it. Then my husband decided to just read it anyways and we were both pleasantly surprised. We both thought this book was little much for young adults. But either way this book was a great one along with 2 others in this trilogy.
I just couldn't stop flipping the pages of this book. It's a book that I truly enjoyed reading and of course had to run out to buy Catching Fire as soon as I finished reading The Hunger Games. Suzanne Collins does a terrific job of telling the story with just enough detail to make you feel as if you are right with Katniss, but not too much detail to bore you to tears.  I highly recommend this book.
My daughter recommended this book and the other 2 in the trilogy.  I wasn't too sure but I am so glad that I listened to her.  I thoroughly loved the writing style and the story of hope and tenacity.  Now I wish there were more books from Collins like these!  Just so you know--I am a retired teacher of 35 years and a grandmother so these books are appropriate for all types and ages of readers!  Enjoy!
Katniss is an unforgettable character, she won my heart from the very begining of the book.  She is both stubborn and carring and definately a fighter.  In this book she takes her sister's place (Prim) in the Hunger Games, basically saving her life, making the ultimate sacrifice.  She changes the history of Panem with her bravery and defiance, I loved this book and would recommend everyone to read it!
This was an outstanding book. The action was perfectly paced and heartstopping. The characters were well drawn, complicated, and very human. The world is sketched bit by bit in a way that doesn't seemed forced at all, and it is a horrifying world indeed. I've been hearing that this and the second in the trilogy are fantastic and the third drops off. If it's half as good, it'll still be a great novel.
I wanted to read this book because it was recommended by my favorite performer, Adam Lambert.  I didn't think it was my kind of story at first, but the writing was compelling and I didn't want to put it down for anything.  After I found out it was a trilogy, I ordered the other 2 books, Catching Fire and Mockinjay.  I'm 1/2 way through the second one and am enjoying it just as much as the 1st one.
I was skeptical of this book, after reading the back it sounded pretty morbid. But I quickly became obsessed. Haven't read a book that kept my attention like this in a long time. Definitely don't judge this book by it's back cover. You might as well buy the other 2 while you're at it because once you're done with this one you will need to start the second right away! So glad my book club picked this!
I wasn't sure what all the hype was about regarding Hunger Games... I watched the movie and thought it was awful and confusing. Then a friend explained the main points and I decided it was worth a read. And now I'm hooked. Phenomenally written and it keeps you wanting more! I finished this series in about 4 days and it soul  have taken less if I didn't have motherly duties to attend to. A must read!
Again and again, I am very impressed with Amazon. I ordered this book on a Sunday and it was waiting on my desk at work that next Tuesday morning. I selected the "Standard Shipping" option, too so I was quite pleasantly surprised by the arrival of my book only two days later. The product was also in great condition, which is always a plus. Thank you for another wonderful purchase experience, Amazon!
AFTER I read the book and purchased the other two books in the trilogy, I learned they were geared for adolescent readers.  While I had noted the book was an easy read, the plot was so dramatic that it really drew me in right from the beginning.  There's lots of action and a bit of innocent romance in addition to the drama.  I think even older readers will enjoy it; I know I did and I'm in my 60's!
My daughter had to read this for school.  I picked it up one afternoon because I was so bored, I would have read just about anything.  This is a can't-put-it-down, stay-up-until-your-done kind of book.  This book will have you bringing it to dinner, hiding it under the table cloth,  and reading it when someone isn't looking. The Hunger Games is fast- paced, exciting, and a great book for all ages.
A very intense book, while not a new concept in the genre it is told very well. Every book out there now is about vampires and people with special powers, Katniss the main character is just a normal person with skills anyone could learn. The characters are well developed, better than any shimmering vampire or hairy werewolf. The quality of this story is amazing, and the qualities displayed by its characters could teach us something.
Despite all the hype, I did not expect the like this novel since I don't usually read ya or dystopian novels. But I loved it! The characters are very well written, as is the plot and the setting. The story line is dynamic and keeps you turning the pages. I am not going to summarize the plot, as this has been done by other reviewers. Suffice it to say, if you haven't read Hunger Games yet, read it!
You have to read it. Good plot. Memorable characters. Twists and turns that are not predictable--like most teen lit.  Good to use with discussions of government, psychology, literary elements, and humanities.  I recommend that teens as well as adults read this book.  It is a series but it does end---which is also nice.  My daughter has reread it 5 times now, and I twice (and I don't reread books).
I loved this book! As far as young adult sci-fi goes, Suzanne Collins got it right!  This book was not only intriguing, romantic, suspenseful, witty, full of action...it is completely appropriate  for it's young adult audience, yet interesting enough for adults.  I read the three books one after another because I could not wait to find out what would happen next. Neither will you, check it out!
A "Young Adult" novel? I began this book only to see what all the fuss was about, especially coming from "Regular' adults. One chapter in I thought - WOW - forget genre, just let me keep reading. I'll never understand the mind of the writer, in terms of where concepts like The Hunger Games are formed, but I sure am glad Ms Collins has such a mind. Never disappointed in a single word.
This is such a great book. When you begin to read it, you feel sorry for the characters and their story.  But the more you read it, you become entranced and feel as though that the plot is a normal occurance.  It's very visual and captivating.  While I didn't want to put it down, I wanted to savor some of the chapters as a treat to read it later.  The final chapters had me trembling.  Good book!
I bought this book recently, mostly out of curiosity for what the hype was all about. I started reading it one night and wasn't able to stop until I finished the entire book. It was absolutely captivating and very well written. It touches on all of the themes at the heart of humanity. Definitely a must read, goes above and beyond all of my expectations and is well worth the hype it has created.
LOVED this book!  I am a very sporadic reader and every once in a while I stumble across a book that gets me back into reading again.  This book definitely did that for me.  It is an easy read and kept my interest going and going.  I am embarrassed to say that sometimes I 300 page book can take me a year to read (again, I am a very sporadic reader) but I polished this one of pretty quickly.
I really didn't know what to expect with this book. I heard all the talk over the movie and wanted to give the book a try. I cracked the first page and before I knew it, i was 2 hours into it and wasn't putting it down for nothing. One of the best books I can say I have honestly read. The series is amazing but of course the first book is the best in my opinion. Its def. a must read book.!!
This book is AMAZING. It is a page turner which makes you think, a lot. As someone who often thinks that best sellers are written in a "dumbed down" way, I cannot help but highly recommend this book to anyone. Also, while the book is gut-wrenching, the movie is much more so. The book is definitely a better choice for the squeamish, though the book and the movie complement each other well.
I have never read another novel like this, and I doubt I ever will. I held onto The Hunger Games from start to finish, unable to eat or sleep until I knew how it would end, and then I went on to the second book. Katniss is living and breathing, full of righteous fury and vulnerability. There is a reward and a cost for being inside her head. Absolutely nothing appears the same afterwards.
I never liked to read but then I saw this movie and liked that so much that I had to read the book. I ended up buy a kindle fire just to read this book and once I started I could not stop. The book I liked better than the movie. I liked the book so much I ended up reading all 3 of them. I have already pre-ordered the movie and plan on re-reading the book before I watch the movie again.
I have read the series and am having withdrawls.  Oh how I wish there were more books in the series, but I have to wait for the movie.  I hope it stands up to the first book.  I loved these characters like they were my children.  I know they were written for Young Adults, but they are just so entertaining, I couldn't put them down.  I have recommended them to all my friends and family.
I would recommend this book to high school kids and adults alike.  I greatly enjoyed it.  The outcome was a little surprising but not completely since the book was written in the first person.  Spoiler Alert - you can't really kill off your narrator can you?  Still a good book that makes you wonder how society might one day turn just as evil.  Think Lord of the Flies meets Armageddon.
Although this is not a genre I typically enjoy, I was immediately hooked on this book and the whole series. The story is very original and is a real page turner, which was hard to put down. The violence gets more intense with each book in the series, so parents should consider their child's age and personality when deciding whether or not their child is ready to read the book/series.
I was SO bummed out not to like this book! Everyone kept talking it up and I expected to be in heaven. Well, no! The story was interesting but frequently hard to believe and simplistic. No connection with any of the characters and the whole thing felt too forced, particularly the love triangle. The only reason I gave this more than one star is that at least there was a lot of action.
Suzanne Collins has one heck of an imagination. I was genuinely surprised and never thought I would be able to get past the idea of children being used as pawns, but I had to know what all the hype was about and I am glad that I did. The author is brilliant. However, be warned parents: this book can get very brutal and violent. I would recommend this book for older teenagers and up.
I've read these books so many times, that I've lost count. Katniss' unknowing courage and heart for Rue and Thresh, her compassion for even Cato.....move me every time. Katniss Everdeen is the heroine that she doesn't expect, doesn't even realize she is...... I love it, because that's what true courage is, being frightened to death and doing what has to be done. Great job, Suzanne!
I have to admit that I saw the movie first, and thought the book progressed at a slower pace. However, I chose to give it a chance and turns out that I am glad that I did. The characters were fully developed, the story progressed smoothly, and there were components included here that seemed imperative to the story but were missing from the film.  Sad story, but interesting concept.
I was persuaded to read this book by my cousin, and I'm glad I did.  This book has some very good scenes that will make you laugh, cry, and even some things in-between.  If you're a fan of novels about dystopian societies or the movie Battle Royale, you'll love this book here.  Although it has some "wtf" moments, I would suggest this book to anyone who needs a good book to read.
I read this book straight through- which hardly ever happens, since I usually read when I can't sleep. This one kept me up and turning the pages.  It's brilliantly written. The world and the plot and the characters are dead-on precisely drawn, and very coherent.  I've been late trying this series, but I am very eager to continue.  Highly recommended.
This was a terrifically exciting read.  Collins knows how to spin suspense into her unique and futuristic world.  The characters are a treat in their own and each chapter leaves you hanging on for more!  It is tough to put the book down once you have started.  Great for teens and grown-ups alike, I think anyone who picks up the book will find themselves engulfed in the Games.
While this book was written for the young adult market, any age will be hooked by the intelligent and absolutely riveting writing in this book. The main character, Katniss, is an unwilling participant in the gruesome "hunger games", in which youth are pulled from each district in the nation to fight each other to the death, all of which is shown on reality TV.  Fantastic book.
Great story line, but they should have put the whole story in one book instead of breaking it up into three seperate books. I intend to read some more of this author, maybe. Although this story wasn't what I consider to be hard scifi, it still held my intrest. I'm glad I read the books without seeing the film, I seem to get so much more from the printed page, for some reason.
This book was so great.  It was suspensful and exciting, with a little bit of romance. If I could sum it up in a few words I would say.. it is a heart renching 'gladiator' game, that challenges your ethics and morals all the while giving you a taste of pure romance-- the type of romance you dream of as a girl. I could not put this down.  My husband said I was like a zombie.
this is a really good book, its really different and thats what i liked most about it, although the actions does not really start until a couple of chapters into the book but once it does it get even better, the only thing that left me kinda  hanging was the end i wish there would have been more but then agian it seems like there is going to be a sequel so i can only hope.
After reading 20 pages I just couldn't put it down and read the rest of the book in 24 hours. I just couldn't stop reading!  The storyline is captivating, the language is simple but beautiful, and the characters are so lively that you feel them as if you were part of the story.  Bought books #2 and #3 right after finishing the first and can't wait to start reading.
I liked the idea of a Post USA - the way it began sucked you in and made you want to get more into the book. Excellent job of getting you to feel the main character even though she was far removed from anything we would relate to in real life. I wish we were as impelled to read happy books as we are to read this type of dark feeling but it is the real way we get intrigued.
The characters here really drew you in. I enjoyed how the book made you feel the story of Catnis, her family and all the others. Their struggle to survive the internal struggles they faced, The character depth was well developed as well I felt as though I knew the main characters in this book. I would recommend this to others, though reading the entire series is a must.
Great story , good mix of science fiction ,mystery and survival with a bit of romance,the story will hook you one from the first pages until the end.I would go as far as to say the ending is the icing on the cake. If you are into science fiction/mystery/survival/romance you cant go wrong with this book. I would not be surprised if i see a movie adaptation in the future.
I saw the movie on the airoplane to Aussie in Dec 2012 and had to buy the trilogy to see if they got the movie right and they did.  I found this a great read and it was the fastest I've read a book in a long time.  It should have a 16+ rating though as I wouldn't let my 9 year read this book as I know lots of her friends have which I find a little disturbing.
Don't avoid this series just because of the hype. Its still worth reading, especially if you like dystopian worlds or liked Battle Royale. The emphasis on outfits, looks and dressing up is a little on the excessive side, and the protagonist isn't exactly a likable character. But if you can get past those things, this is a great novel. Probably the best of the series.
My daughter loved this book and after seeing the movie I had to read this.  It was so well written well thought out. The idea the district's being our different geographical states one could easily into that and compare to our present governments treatment of certain states and populations.  Of course we fall big time for these characters!highly recommended!
A friend recommended THE HUNGER GAMES to me about a year ago, but I held off on reading it because the premise was kind of morbid. I finally decided to pick it up, and I read it in about a day and a half. I couldn't put it down! I really became attached to the characters, especially Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch. I couldn't wait to read Catching Fire when I was done!
The Hunger Games is an AMAZING, 5 star book. Anyone who likes survival, futuristic, or romance stories is sure to adore this book. I myself love futuristic survival stories. If you have not read this, you MUST because it is too wonderful a book to resist reading. Anything less than a 5 star rating must have an important reason to go with it because this is AMAZING.
A ripping yarn, well paced and thoughtfully put together.  Stories centered around a love triangle usually leave me cold but in this case Ms. Collins didn't allow the romantic complications to overwhelm her core story (looking at you, Laurell Hamilton).  Although clearly written for a younger audience, the book held my attention to the end and left me wanting more.
I saw the movie several months ago. Left me feeling a little strange, with what type of movie it was. But it left me with interesting thoughts. My daughter thought I might like the book so I have about 20 pages left to go and the book makes me want to see the movie again. Great book, great writer. Will have to go look and see what other books they have written....
I started reading this because I kept hearing how great it was. I typically do not like "sci-fi" types of books but I was able to borrow it from someone so I gave it a shot. It was slow going for the first 70 pages or so but then once I got past that, I couldn't set it down.  I stayed up all night to finish reading it and then couldn't wait to get the second book!
This book was way better than the movie ..  I actually fall in love with Peeta ... I love the way the book is written always wanting to not stop reading ...It start out in Katniss' point of view .. Everything she is feeeling the way she thinks like a normal human girl ...i can see how this book is a real big hit ...thanks for writting this book suzanne collins ..
My gosh, I tried hard to avoid the hype of the Hunger Games, but I got drawn into it. This book is so much more than expected! The author draws you into the story and makes you feel like you're actually there and watching this unfold live. I could not put this down. I finished the entire book overnight an  I'm really gonna read it again! Definitely a great book!
I normally wouldn't have picked this book up but my daughter insisted it was good and that I would like it.  I am a really slow reader but couldn't put this book down and read it in no time. Seems that it would be an enjoyable book for youth also.  Violent idea but not graphic, romance but no sex, strong characters.  I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
This was an amazing book! The characters are portrayed so well you come to love, or hate, them. They come to life in your imagination and you can't help, despite the unspeakable premise of the Games, cheer for your favorites,When I finished this book I went directly on to the second, It is that good you simply have to see what transpires in the following texts.
The last 10% of this book and other scenes where all those elaborate descriptions of dressing, make-up, food, etc. before the MC enters into the Hunger Games should have been cut, IMO. Otherwise, this book deserves 5 stars - Excellent story-telling. Also, am not sure if this is for kids, as categorized, but adults can definitely read it. Great Kindle pricing :)
Of course, the first book is always the best, and this one was excellent!  It was one of those books I just couldn't put down.  Although I have seen the movie a couple of times, I'll probably still go back and read the books again.  They fill in all the blanks that movies just can't do.  Loved it so much better than the Twilight Series, which I have also read.
I wanted to read this series before the movie came out because as we all know the book is usually better. Wow!! This book was more than good, it was amazing. The characters are believable, the writting is excellent, and it left me haunted for days thinking about my own kids in that situation. I'm always leary about Y/A books, but this one is good for all ages.
I'm a teacher and saw a student reading this book. I asked, "Is it good?" and he enthusiastically said, "YES!". That was enough for me to get the book the next day. I was immediately sucked in. I'm sure this review is not the predominately featured one so let me just tell you that it's a quick read and you won't want to put it down. Yes, it does meet the hype!
It is sci-fi / horror though.  Was somewhat amazed that my 7th grader was reading it in school last year, but I picked it up and started reading it, and could not put it down.  It is dystopian futuristic, PTSD, fiction, may be horrifying/depressing for some to read, but this could be believable in the future, if we are not careful, post catastrophe, post war.
This book took me by surprise. It had been on my shelf for a very long time and I kept picking it up and putting it down again. Then last week I read the first chapter with no real intention of reading it all but it had me hooked . It is truly original. Don't waste a moment more go and buy it. As soon as I finished it I had to buy the next two in the series.
This is not the kind of book I normally read, but my daughter INSISTED it was a must read.  I'm so glad she pushed me to read it.  It's nothing short of brilliant, everything an author aspires to and everything a reader looks for.  Innovative, unusual, unexpected twists.  Even if it doesn't look like "your cup of tea" read it anyway.  You'll be glad you did.
Hunger Games was a book that had been sitting on my bookshelf for the last few months unread. I finally decided to read it yesterday. It is a very easy book to finish in a few hours. I did enjoy the book but I just felt the whole time I was looking for more details and descriptions. However I will continue to read the series since it is an entertaining book.
The Hunger Games is an amazing dystopian post-apocalyptic science-fiction adventure where Tributes from each District in Panem have to compete and survive in the Hunger Games. It's a great risk everyone will have to take and never forget. It's a choice whether people can live or die in a post-apocalyptic future depending on their determination for survival.
I saw the movie first, and then went back and read the book and I am so glad I did. Really amazing! I couldn't put it down. Read it in one day. Even though I already knew what happened, it was a riveting read and I found my heart was racing during parts. Very intense and I love all the nuances and details that I got from the book that the movie didn't have.
Though not normally a fan of first-person narrative, I found this book well worth the time. Could be a true vision of a dystopian future for our world. The mystery of the other characters mindsets and motivations works well with the practicality and, sometimes, clueless view from the main character, Katniss.  Look forward to the next title from this author.
I have to say I loved this book. When I first started reading it, I knew nothing about it, I honestly thought it was going to be a zombie book.  I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the characters and the story.  Katniss and Peeta are true heroes. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  No wonder its been at the top of the best seller list for so long!
I read this book in one day. Could not put it down. So intriguing and Suzanne Collins made me feel I was a part of the games. I even stopped working on our bathroom remodel til I was finished. I was hesitant to read this at first because of the subject matter. Children killing one another. But so glad I did. I recommend this book. Looking forward to book 2
Now I understand the excitement behind this series!  I have not seen the movie but it did give me a reason to look into the books.  While I realize it was written for a younger audience I thoroughly enjoyed the story and am looking forward to reading the remaining books in the trilogy.  It also helped that it was available for free loan from Amazon Prime.
Overall I really liked this book. The middle was especially suspenseful and it became a real page turner. By the end of the book I was satisfied with how it ended but it didn't make me run out and buy the next book in the series. I was expecting the ending to be such a cliffhanger that I had to know what happened next right now! But that wasn't the case.
I loved The Hunger Games! It is now my favorite series! The book is also impossible to put down and the details were amazing! I would totally recommend the bokk to anyone and everybody. If you're looking for a book that keeps you on your toes, filled with action, and is a great series then read the Hunger Games and "may the odds be ever in your favor!"
I LOVE this book. I love it so much it only took me a week to finish it. My favorite character is Rue. I think it's so cool that she can jump around in the trees. I seriously thought Rue would try to kill Katniss, but I guess I was wrong. Rue really saved Katniss when she pointed out that tracker jacker nest. I hope you like the book as much as I did!
I struggled to get past the idea of this being a "kid's book" for most if the storyline. But while some of the major plot points do seem a little predictable for an adult reader, there is enough subtext to be satisfying. I'd heard that the book was brutally violent, but I didn't find it so. Looking forward to the movie and then the next book.
Being an older reader I thought the reading might appeal to the young.  However I could'nt wait to read all three books. It put my mind to work  imagining the scenery, the blood and guts, the characters good and bad.  Hope we don't experience this situation in the future. Looking forward  to reading more of the same by Suzanne Collins
This book is a great book. I really enjoyed it. It was a little scary but it was also very exciting. In some parts it made me feel tingly inside. In this book a girl named katness was forced to go to the Hunger Games. In the games kids 12-16 will fight till the death untill one kid is left. They are called victors. This is the best book I have read.
Great plot.  Good story telling. Enjoyed the "David vs Goliath" nature of the story.  It was great to finally have a book that I didn't want to put down!  Downloaded the 2nd book immediately after I had finished the first.  Have not seen the movie, but heard that the movie was not good at all (so dont compare it to that).
I didn't want to believe the hype. I thought the world had gone nuts over another brainless book. But then I decided to read The Hunger Games from the Kindle lender's library. Oh my goodness. What an amazing story! The tragedy, the drama, the betrayal, the love, the WHOLE thing. I am immediately going to read the next book in the series. I'm hooked.
I did not want to read these books, I usually do not enjoy books in a series, but this is an outstanding book. The plot line is an old one but the author weaves her characters into new twists and surprises on the good vs evil theme.  I would recommend this book, I was on a three week vacation and had it on my Ipad and had to order the other two.
I'd have easily read this all in one sitting if I had the time.  It maintains a good pace throughout.  It's not entirely predictable.  If you get into the first few chapters and decide you like it, you might consider ordering the next book right away.  This one finishes the immediate storyline but it leads right into the second book in the series.
This was a thrilling ride from start to finish, a trilogy that pokes at our own cultural foibles. While I've seen some criticise  the fact that young adults are exposed to battles to the death, it's not too outlandish considering what young people have been exposed to throughout the ages. Teenagers have been forced to work down mine shafts, get married, and even ruled countries. In most cultures, kids become adults at thirteen! I'm all for kids' rights, and legal ages, but found the criticism of this fictional masterpiece silly. And by the way, the books are better than the films, too.
Great book completely different from the movie.  Preferred the book instead of the movie.  Perfect as a Kindle download. Cheers
I was told by a friend to get this book  so glad she did  It was very interesting and different than anything I had read before
Didn't really think I would enjoy the story line of this series of books but ended up just loving it
Easy reading and quite entertaining. There are parts that would definitely suit a movie more than in a book. The ending was a little disappointing but I guess it leads on to the second book.
What a good read this was. Best book I have read in ages. Pretty hard to put down and I did not want it to end. On to the next one now.
Okay, so I've been avoiding this one for a long time as I'm not much of a hype follower.  But on a whim (stuck on a train and just finished a book on my Kindle) this popped up as suggested reading and I figured I'd give it a shot.  I'm really glad I did.  The narrative style took a bit of getting used to, but overall this was a highly enjoyable read.  I'm now reading the sequel, so that's saying a lot!
The hunger games brings you into a world you never want to see. And very quickly grabs a hold of you and won't let you go into you finish the book. You just have to know what's going to  Cat. At the end of the book you hope her world will be better. But you have the feeling that it won't.
These books were really excellent, however they really do need to be read as a trilogy.  I do not really understand why authors write it in the form of 3 books, when each was very short, and cannot really stand on their own.  Is it because they get paid to get something out quickly?  Having said that, it is a great read.
I thought this would be one of those books that couldn't live up to its own hype.. I was wrong. I couldn't stop reading&amp; will be starting book 2 straight away!
I bought this for my dad, as he loves a good story, but he is in his 70s now and his eyes don't let him read for as long as he would like to. Over the years I have always shared books with him that I love, and now I buy him the best ones as audio books. I love The Hunger Games series, and now I think he will too. He's really enjoyed listening to the first one, in fact, he's been flying through it. I highly recommend it, for those who can't or don't want to just sit down and read the book for whatever reason, or for those who enjoy having a story told to them.
I watched the movie when it came out in theatres without having read the book and thought the movie was ok.  Friends that did read the book told me the movie did not do the book justice.  So, after seeing a great deal on Amazon for the book, (less than 2 bucks, I think!), thought I'd check it out.  If you liked the movie AT ALL..you will LOVE the book.  Or, if you are like some of my friends and hated the movie (they were kind of right)...there is still a pretty good chance you will LOVE the book. :)
Excellent novel for all ages! I highly recommend this for a great read. Engaging, well written, and entertaining. Clean and appropriate for all audience. Even my husband enjoyed it! This book will suck you in and let you get lost in a great story!
I ordered and had this sent to my sister as a surprise.  She was thrilled!  It was shipped in a timely manner and was in very good shape, according to her.  She sat down and read it through that day!
I wasn't sure how I was going to like this book as I'm always a bit worried about YA books, but although the main character was a YA that is about where it stops being YA.  The book was well written and engaging and moved well from suspenseful to suspenseful moment.  The characters are liable if a bit transparent (they are teenagers after all) but the flow of the book is such that it's easy to get engrossed in the story.
This book is wonderful! I read the entire book (except for the last few pages) on a flight home from Hawaii and actually wanted to sit on the plane to finish it! It is that good! The movie is great too, but the book is always better!
With over 10,000 reviews and a hit movie, there is little left to be said about Suzanne Collins' "The Hunger Games".  I admit I'm a little late in coming to the game, but I'm glad I finally got a chance to read this book.  It is an incredibly hard to put down book that will leave readers gasping for more.  Everyone knows the basic plot.  In a dystopian world, two tributes from each district of Panem must compete in the Hunger Games.  Winning means becoming rich; losing means certain death.  When Katniss Everden hears her sister's name called at the annual selection process, she volunteers herself.  Unwittingly, she finds herself a favorite among the Gamemakers, especially after her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, declares his undying love for her.  Katniss has incredible prowess with a bow and arrow, but isn't looking forward to facing off against Peeta to win the games.  The longer she stays in the games the more she questions the rules that regulate their existence - the hardships that people face in the outer districts compared with the ease and frivolousness of life in the Capitol.  Can Katniss find a way to win the games but subvert the intentions of the Gamemakers who see nothing wrong with making children kill each other for sport?  Collins has crafted a unique dystopian story that will appeal to male and female readers alike.  So many young adult novels seem to be directed towards one or the other, but "The Hunger Games", even though narrated by Katniss, will certainly be enjoyed by male readers.  Collins keeps the action going, causing readers to push ahead at breakneck speed and thirsting for more when they reach the end of this first book.  I cannot wait to read the second in the trilogy to find out how  this disturbing dystopian world can change.
I'm often the reader that's late to the game when it comes to the books and series that blow up and cause a sort of pandemonium - for the most part at least. I didn't read HARRY POTTER until the first four books were in paperback. I didn't read TWILIGHT until the fourth book was just released. I only recently read THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF OZ a few years ago. I have yet to finish THE LORD OF THE RINGS or PERCY JACKSON or THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA. So despite the fact that THE HUNGER GAMES became the talk of the book world when it released in 2008, I brushed it aside and thought nothing of it. The recent emergence of a website devoted to the Games (due, in large part, to the the film release coming up) sparked my curiosity and so I read.  Though the beginning felt a bit slow, the tale of Katniss Everdeen quickly became thrilling and heart-stopping. In a post-apocalyptic world, a government known as the Capitol rules over 12 districts (formerly 13). As a reminder to those citizens who may want to rebel against them, the Capitol holds an annual "event" known as The Hunger Games, during which one boy and one girl from each district is forced to fight to survive in front of cameras that broadcast the games live to everyone. The goal of the Games? To be the last one standing. For the 74th annual games, 16-year-old Katniss is the girl sent from District 12 when she jumps in to take the place of her younger sister; with her goes Peeta Mallark. The two of them join the other tributes - some ruthless, some stealthy, and some secretive - in a fight to the death for survival.  One of the reasons I ended up liking this book were Suzanne Collins' characters. Katniss, while not perfect, is strong, smart, clever, and determined - traits that are often hard to find in novels for young adults, though they are becoming more popular. In a world (both before and during the games) where survival is key, she is willing to do anything to stay alive. Does it always translate well as a character? No, I don't believe so, but I do believe that her downfalls are merely due to her need to move forward. Peeta has many layers, not all of which are revealed from the beginning, though Collins manages to reveal this character's depth in a way that is not annoying and manages to keep readers interested. For me personally, there was a lot of flip-flopping between liking him and distrusting him, which makes me believe that he's as real as they come. After all, what girl isn't confused by boys? Supporting characters are briefly showcased but spotlighted well. Rae is a character that will make people sit up and take notice, Haymitch is confusing at his best, Madge is somewhat forgettable but leaves a lasting impression for her gift to Katniss.  Though the dystopian setting is popular right now (especially since it's been more than a few years since THE HUNGER GAMES released), Collins' story is riveting and full of twists and turns that left me breathless and wondering about who was good, who was bad, and what was true. The premise is reminiscent of THE LOTTERY by Shirley Jackson but Collins weaves such intricate moments from Katniss' perspective that I can almost forgive the writing style. Collins writes in choppy sentences, no doubt a mimic of a teenager's racing mind and thoughts that jump from one topic to the next; I wasn't a fan but the story was intriguing enough that I continued reading.  The ending is a clear introduction to the following book, CATCHING FIRE, which is, in a way, unnecessary. With the majority of the trials and tribulations coming to a close by the book's end, I believe Collins could have written an ending that was more concise and closed. While I enjoy trilogies, I like books that can stand alone in its own way. That is, I don't mind having to read more but I like to have a clear beginning, middle, and end. I look forward to reading the 2nd book in this trilogy but I wish I didn't have to, if that makes any sense.  THE HUNGER GAMES is a great and entertaining book but it's also a look into the psyche of humans and an opening of questions regarding governments and reality television, of all things. If you haven't picked this book up (for whatever reason), do yourself a favor - put it on your "to read" list.  -- originally reviewed for Ordinary People, Extraordinary Works --
As I type this, I've already started in on the second book in this series via audiobook. It's a pretty entertaining series and I can see where Collins's work has had a particularly large influence on the dystopian genre as a whole. You can argue that there's better out there or more well known works, but this was exactly what such an under-noticed genre needed to fully push itself into mainstream notice, just as Twilight was what YA PNR/UF needed to gain traction.  The basic premise here is actually pretty horrific for a teen/children's novel. You have a society that is constantly kept on the brink of starvation due to the seemingly selfish actions of an Orwellian government that is always watching for signs of rebellion. Despite there having been a potential mass extinction event, the world outside of the Districts is relatively full of life sustaining wild foods and game- which suggests that starvation could potentially be avoided if not for the Capitol's mandate that nobody stray outside of the walls. There was a rebellion, but it was squashed and in retaliation the Capitol essentially requires that every District send two children to the Hunger Games to fight each other semi-gladiator style for their amusement. The wealthier districts, the ones who can afford to train their children from birth and always seem to have enough to eat, don't mind this as much as the poorer districts who live day to day and enter the games emaciated- ensuring their defeat and deaths.  It's into this type of world that we see Katniss, a girl who can't afford to be sentimental but is devoted to her family. She enters the games due to her love for her sister and ends up getting caught up in the various games the Capitol has to offer both in and out of the arena. Katniss is forced to agree to a rather twisted ploy for survival: to fake love with Peeta to gain support from various benefactors. This is actually fairly interesting, as many novels of this like would have her instantly falling for Peeta at first sight and there being obvious protestations of love from the get go. This might be spoilerish, but as there's tons of reviews of the book and movie commenting on their relationship I think that most will already be aware of the basic spoilers. Katniss takes a lot of convincing to even acknowledge what basic emotions she does feel, which I liked. The story in this first book isn't really about romance, it's about survival and personal freedoms first and foremost. It's obvious that romance will eventually become a main thrust of the series, but right here and now it's just having the groundwork laid for future love triangles and developments. I respect this, as most times you have the romance between the various characters be the central focus of the series, with anything else being there just to highlight how in "wub" the two main characters are. It's nice to have something that has the romance as something to accent a more major and more pressing plot point.  This book isn't entirely perfect, mind you. There are points where the plot does seem to be a little overly extended and some readers will undoubtedly be frustrated with a general lack of detail about a lot of elements in the novel. As the book's focus is survival, we're given only what is most pertinent to the moment as far as back story goes for Panem in general. It makes sense that there wouldn't be gobs of info drops, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating at times. Having a little more description about how rough life is would make it more understanding to have someone around Katniss's age or the wonderfully tragic Rue's age act so mature. Their maturity is sometimes at odds with how they act, which both helps and hurts things. It reminds us that they're still kids but it'd also be good to show that these characters never had time to be kids.  Ultimately though, this is a great book and the narration here is very well done. If you have a chance to listen to this as opposed to reading it, I highly recommend it. McCormick is pretty talented and I loved how she voiced Haymitch.
I didn't know what to expect when I first picked up this book. I had heard a very brief description of it, and it didn't sound like my thing. But so many people recommended it, that I went ahead and read it. I'm so glad that I did. It's exceptionally written, thought provoking, and intense. It's really a must read. I've read it over and over again.
About:  In The Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins has created a gritty dystopian world that is ruled by the Capital of Panem.  The Capital is surrounded by twelve districts and most people are starving to death.  The Hunger Games is a televised fight to the death that takes place each year. During an event called 'The Reaping', one boy and one girl from each district are chosen for the games. There are twenty four 'tributes' total that will compete in the Hunger Games.  Talk about reality tv in the extreme!  Our protagonist, young Katniss Everdeen, hunts with her bow and arrow to feed her family. Her father died in a mine blast. Katniss Everdeen's best friend and hunting partner is a boy named Dale.  Now that The Reaping is coming around again, her twelve year old sister, Prim, is old enough to have her name put in. To Katnisses horror, Prim is the first name drawn from Disctrict 12. Katniss volunteers to take her place. The boy chosen from Katnisses district is the baker's son, Peeta Mellark. As Katniss participates in the Hunger Games, she finds unexpected friends and even a love interest.  At first she thought she had no chance of winning, but as the games progress her survival instincts kick in.  My thoughts:  When I first began reading The Hunger Games I had no idea I would be sucked into this gritty dystopian world.  I must say, I found the first sixty pages or so to be slow going. However, once the games began I could not put the book down, especially the last hundred pages or so.  Author Suzanne Collins writes multi dimensional characters and an action packed storyline. Those Hunger Games are tough! The final battle scene turned my stomach.  I really enjoy dystopian fiction, I like these gritty, desperate types of stories. The Capital is harsh and cruel, using these kids fight to the death as entertainment and as a reminder of the power they hold over everyone. There's plenty of mind games and manipulation involved here.  I liked Katniss from the start, for being just sixteen, she holds her own and survives as best she can. She takes care of her mom and sister after her father dies and her mom goes into a deep depression. Katniss resents her mom for this. Once she is in the arena, she really thinks things through as she plays the game.  I liked Peeta as well. As the book progresses, his character is really sweet.  Then of course, there is Gale, Katnisses best friend back home. We don't get to see much from Dale in this book, but I have a feeling a love triangle is just getting started.  The cast of supporting characters is well written as well and the world building was great, so as the story progressed, I was easily swept up.
I resisted the Hunger Games for quite a while just because it was so insanely popular.  Finally, I broke down and bought an audiobook copy.  Now I understand why it is so popular!  The story is unusual, character-driven, action-packed, and written in a style so direct and clear it comes across as intense as the characters and circumstances it describes.  The storyline is often grim but interspersed with flashes of humor.  My 12 year old son loved this book and the rest of the trilogy, even though the main character is a girl.  Finally, I enjoyed the voice of the actress who read the book aloud.  When looking to buy the audiobooks for the next two stories, I ran across a number of reviews that criticized the reader of those books - said she was unsuitable, too old for Katness, didn't make her voice masculine enough for the male characters, etc.  I rushed to see if the publishers had changed the reading voice - and it was the same actress!  I think she does a great job, her voice is compelling and not quite smooth, gets across the occasional harshness of the characters and the story.  I think some people not familiar with being read aloud to, were perhaps expecting an audiobook to sound more like a play?  That's the only reason I can come up with for understanding the point of view of those reviews.  Since then I have listened to both Catching Fire and Mockingjay on audiobook, loved the stories and how they were read aloud.  The books are great, and particularly suited to listening to, in the car or otherwise.  I highly recommend the audiobooks, and these books in any media, for kids maybe 11 and up, and for adults as well.
I have the complete trilogy purchased as separate books, but, only the first book-The Hunger Games-is available as a hardbound 'collector's edition.' So, I bought this more expensive hard cover version as a long term investment.  The story across the 3 books is remarkable, surely one of the best in the 'war and peace' genre since Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series.  I recommended on my fb page that The Hunger Games trilogy should be required reading in social studies or political science classes at the sophomore or junior level in high school.  My niece relayed that her husband's high school is teaching The Hunger Games in a 9th grade civics class.  Excellent.  Now, I would recommend that you buy each of these books, if buying as hardbacks, in the dust-cover, not the so-called collector's edition.  This edition has a lovely, well-constructed slip cover, but, the book itself has no additional dust cover with the lovely art (as do books 2 and 3 not yet out in the "collector's" version.)  The Hunger Games collector's edition book binding is cheaper quality material in terms of both cover and the paper used for the pages, which are also crudely cut anyway compared to the hardcover books 2 and 3.  Not acceptable.  Buy all 3 hardcover books The Hunger Games - Collector's Edition separately only in the dust cover version!
The Hunger Games seems to be very similar to Battle Royale. Both are set in the future, and involve children fighting to the death. Collin's book is not a rip of Battle Royale, but much rather a book with a similar plot idea. I do not want to give away too many spoilers, but how Collin's presents the characters of district 12, and how they are living in poverty, makes you really feel for the people and their struggle for living. The moment you pick it up you do not want to put it down until it is finished. The way Katniss's thoughts are presented throughout the story helps you better connect to her and the overall story/history of the games. You would think that there would be a large of amount of confusion with all the different roles of the characters, districts, and how Panem is setup, but enough information is given to give you the sense of what is going on (nothing is worse then a poor introduction of a plot). Overall, The Hunger Games is a well-written book, and i highly recommend reading. Oh, and go watch the movie when you are done!
From my wife Sarah: Others have written about the story line so I'll just get right to it. I had read that this was a book designed for teens so I stayed away from it until I saw the movie. I was curious and got the first book. It was amazing, so I got the other two. This is definitely a book for adults too.  I can't remember when I've been so moved by a fiction book. The writing in the series was genius, making the characters so alive, real, honest and easy to relate to. The story lines in all three books were absolutely unpredictable and so compelling that I read the trilogy in 4 days, and I'm not a particularly fast reader.  As a Scifi fan, I found that the Scifi element was totally satisfying to me. It was so imaginative and new. The author created an entire new earth, designing everything from various cultures to politics, medicine, technology, fashion and more.  And ultimately I'd say there was a very deep message that was being communicated. I'll let you experience it for yourself, but it was so well done.  The books were exciting though violent and deeply sad at times. It wasn't your typical story where everyone you care about ends up happily ever after. But that's part of what makes it so powerful and worth reading.  I would say that parents who have a say in what their kids read should read it first and then decide if it's okay for them.  Late teens and adults, these are the best fiction books I've read in a long time, and I highly recommend them.
Yes I usually give in to the hoopla and read what's got the most hype.  When I read this though I couldn't help but compare to Twilight series. Mostly because people keep saying with the movies coming out it going to be the new phenom.  So I feel compared to Twilight the writing is much better and just feels powerful.  The detailed description of the characters, the district and the capitol was stunning.  It is a world that was created almost like Harry Potter series.  Like Twilight this has a love story thrown in , very creatively I must say, but disengaged with the love story.  In fact I found my self skimming when it became mushy.  I thought the writing to be excellent but did not feel the hype.  The first book really felt like a intro to the characters.  Which makes me wonder how the two other books in the series fare.  Saying all that I had fun reading it because it brought me back to enjoy reading as I was on a break.
I was SO thrilled when a Hunger Games fansite shared on Facebook that Amazon had listed the Hunger Games Collectors Edition as available (Origionally it was to be released in November) and ordered myself a copy immediately.  I love so many things about this special edition, I know there have been a lot of reviews that weren't 100% pleased with this item.  So it's not luxorious.  THIS IS the Hunger Games we're talking about here...  I love the new Mockingjay on the box cover and page edges on the book!
Im not here to write a review based on other books/products or even the story itself( which is awesome if you havent read it by the way), but to comment on this item listing.  The package came well sealed with no damage from shipping at all, which is always a plus. The book comes with a case that can be stored in with what appears to be new mockingjay artwork. The hardcover cloth binding seems durable, and is pretty cool too. As a fan of the book, and only owning the kindle edition until now, personally I feel like it was a great buy. If you are new to the series, I would suggest maybe getting the standard edition, but if you are already a fan of this great series, you should definitely check this out.
I just finished reading this tonight and it was a fantastic book.  Finished in about a week.  Between school and work I didn't have time to finish it faster.  But I really fell for Katniss and her dilemma(s).  It was a fantastic story that was funny, scary (not bad scary) and sad.  I look forward to reading Catching Fire which I will start tonight.
If you combined Alexanders Dumas, père, with a dose of George Orwell, you would get Suzanne Collins. That's how good she is. I'm thankful she's so unabashed about using her amazing talents to tell ripping yarns -- this is what can save reading books in the modern world, the willingness to engage with story at such high velocity. Thank you, Suzanne.
I really enjoyed this book. I read it because my daughter was reading it for school and wanted to be able to discuss it with her along the way. I probably would not have read it otherwise. I couldn't put it down and finished it long before she did. I watched the movie after, but loves the book more. Looking forward to reading 'catching fire' next'
The first book of the Suzanne Collins series about how each district must give up a male and female to fight for the right to win to the death to reign as the years winners to commemorate the insurrection against the systems government (Panem). The beginning where Katniss volunteers for the first time in the Hunger Games to take her sisters place.
The premise is not terribly original  - It reminded me of any number of post-apocolypse movies (or even a really bad reality TV show!  That said, the book grabs you by the collar from page one and won't let go.  I had a hard time putting this down.  The characters were engaging and believable.  Very much looking forward to the rest of the trilogy.
I was hesitant to read this book because of the cult following it seemed to develop.  I'm very glad I finally gave in and read it. While some of the events were a bit predictable, they were set off by many other imaginative and thought provoking scenes.  I admit that I am eagerly looking forward to indulging in the remaining books of the trilogy.
My sister gave me this book at 10 pm. I couldn't stop reading it until I finished at at 3am on a work night! That's how addictive it is. This is the first book in years that had that effect on me. This story was well written with lovable character and a theme that relevant in this age of reality tv programming. If I could I would give it 10 stars
I was told about this book by a friend and so I thought I'd read it.  It was engaging from the start.  I enjoyed the story line.  The development of characters really draws you in and you love and loath each of them as if you were there yourself.  I ended up getting the rest of the trilogy because I had to know how it ended!  Entertaining read.
I purchased Th Hunger Games @ my nieces suggestion for my son to read. He promptly turned his nose up (no vampires!). However the school reading log beckoned and he had to get some reading done. 2 hours later I was was happily signing off on 50 pages read and planning on getting the next book on the series! I love it when a plan comes together.
As mistress of dystopian fiction, Suzanne Collins weaves an action-packed science fiction thriller based on Theseus and gladiators, all thrust into a novel with adventure, dystopia, politics, technology, combat and romance, making this one of the greatest young adult novels ever and by far with the greatest conceptualization of any novel ever.
The movie followed the book relativity well however, the depth that Suzanne Collins takes her characters is incredible. When I saw the movie, I wasn't really left with that feeling of "I need to see more" and was content with the ending just being the end. When reading the book I was longing for more... I will be buying the other two books =).
I confess my daughter recommended this book and at first I thought I wasn't going to like it but I was quickly proven wrong.  While it is somewhat twisted the storyline is easy to follow.  I was disappointed at the end to find that you really don't know what the end is - can't wait to read the second book.  There are three books in the series.
An interesting read. I enjoyed the book. I haven't seen the movie. I was a bit disappointed in the wind down after the climax. I think it would have been better just ending without setting it up for the sequel. This is a young adult book that I as a mature adult found an interesting light read. A recommended summer read and you will enjoy it.
I couldn't put this book down! I had a few sleepless nights because "one more chapter and then i'll go to bed" turned into "one more page" and then "One more chapter" LOL Loved this book. Definitely pulled at my heart strings and I felt for Katniss. The movie doesn't even compare to the greatness of this book!!!!!!!!!
I was completely drawn in by the post-apocalyptical time setting for this story.  I felt that I could really relate to Katniss in her struggle to take care of her family by gathering/hunting for food once her father was gone.  She was also so self sacrificing and noble.  I couldn't put the book down and needed to read the sequel immediately!
I loved The Hunger Games: it was the best book I've ever read.  It may not sound like "your type of book". Believe me, it wasn't mine either until I started reading it and I couldn't put it down. My advice is to just try it and you won't be able to put it down.  Its adventurous, suspenseful and will have you dying to know what happens next!
This book was so well constructed, from the location, background, and characters that I couldn't put it down once I started, and also was compelled to read the next two books in the trilogy.  I especially loved the strength and determination of the main character, and how she related to the others; a marvelous example of female empowerment!
I have never written a book review before, but I just feel compelled to tell people about this book and the two that follow.  It was truly amazing!  I was there every step of the way, I was a character in the book somehow!  I didn't feel like I was reading, I felt like I was there and witnessing.  What a ride.  I cannot believe it is over.
The writing was good, but the story itself could have been condensed.  Nothing and mean nothing speaks to me that this book was this huge success.  Perhaps I built up expectations because of all the hype, but I knew where this story was heading by the end of chapter 2.  I am willing to read the second book, to see if it improves.
This book was absolutely amazing. Beautifully written. The book was extremely suspenseful, and I just couldn't stop reading it. Anyone who likes a thrilling, futuristic book will fall in love with this book. The characters seemed so real, as if I actually knew them. You just can't help but be envious of Katniss's determination and bravery.
Many times we read books and a short time later we cannot recall the content of the book.  Not this one!  I will never forget the Hunger Game series.  (3 books). There are many lessons to be learned about politics and about what could be the future of this country and how easily it could happen.  The books are much better than the movies.
I love love love love police this book!!! This is my second time reading it and I basically read it in a day. You can not put it down it has that perfect touch of action and excitement with a touch of romance! I highly recommend it and most people who liked the movie or not thought the hunger games was truly amazing. It's worth the buy!!!
This story tells of how one struggles with poverty, loss and love.  The story follows a young girl who has had to take the head of the house after her father passes away.  She makes the ultimate sacrifice for little sister, and faces death only to end up questioning love and living with guilt.  Not a bad story, a little dark, but not bad.
The Hunger Games trilogy was extremely entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoysa good story.  It was written with the teenager in mind as the target audience but I found that any audience would be throughly satisfied.  I completed the three books in one weekend and I am now looking forward to watching the film versions.
I bought it about a year ago and when I started reading it I thought this isn't  a good book for me. I kept hearing people talking about the book and the movie, so I thought that I would try it again. I became so engaged in the story that I hated to see it end but now I'm reading the second book. It is a book that will stay in my memory.
This was a Great read! The suspense will keep you itching to find out what happens next. Great twist of events through ought the story, really puts you in another place and time. The romance was well initiated and clearly will continue to develop in the next two books. I'd suggest this book to anyone who enjoys suspense, action, romance.
What a talented storyteller Ms. collins is! I am such an avid reader and this book will go into my favorites collection. I was grabbed in the first chapter and the way you get to know the main character is phenomenal. I couldn't put it down. Thanks for such a unique story. I am telling everyone about the book and their NEED to READ IT!!!
Love this book - that a female lead character could be so intelligent, cunning, &amp; brave...not surprising that it is written by a female author.  The characters are rich and sympathetic; and the country Panem is so obviously a vision of what the U.S. may look like in a hundred years or so when energy sources &amp; resources have been drained.
Hunger Games is not the type of book or story line I generally read. However, Was talked into trying it. Got hooked almost immediately. Very different but extremely interesting to the point I didn't want to put it down. Well written and very imaginative. Wanted to read more so was given hard cover books 2 and 3 to read. Equally as good.
This was one of the best books I have read in months. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. My husband,  who is a "sometimes" reader, read them first and couldn't wait to start each of the next two books! That's when I knew I had to read them too! It is sometimes violent and sometimes touching. You won't be able to put it down!
I bought this book (and the additional two others) simply because I saw the trailer for the movie. I usually prefer books to movies, and this was no disappointment! The Hunger Games was riveting, emotional, and perfectly written. I will write a separate review for the other three, but overall this book was the very best in the Trilogy.
This (and the series) are awesome. The narrative speed is such it does not seem rushed yet keeps you glued to it til the very end. THEN you'll find yourself immediately purchasing the next in the series. Katniss will end up as much your hero as District 12's hero and mine. READ THIS BOOK, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! -Michelle Murray
This is definitely not recommended as a young adult book. It is such a violent sci-fi story, and so unlike anything I have ever read. I don't even watch this type of movie. I was horrified at what I was reading, yet felt like I couldn't put the book down. As soon as I finished the Hunger Games, I purchased the next book in the series.
You know, I had heard a lot about this book because of the movie(s).  I really was skeptical when I borrowed this book from the lending library, but I was hooked immediately.  This book kept me interested the entire time.  It was hard to put down.  The story is captivating and really makes you think.  I recommend this book to anyone.
I chose this rating because it's one of the best books I've ever read...... I was not able to put this book down until I finished it........I love to read but I was so intrigued with this book that it only took me an hour and a half to read...... I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone that loves to read as much as I do :)
Out of all the books in the past I have read, this is by far one of the best. Why I chose a 5 star? I chose such a high rating, because this was such an amazing book, so well written, and many more reasons. I personally would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventurous and intense books. All in all, this is an amazing book.
This book is one of the greatest books I have read in a long time. I read the other reviews and thought I would give it a try and I am so glad I did. All I can say is you have to read it to understand how truly awesome it is. It was so good I couldnt put it down I read it in one day. My advice is to read it you wont be disappointed.
I knew that this was a wildly popular book series,but somehow what I heard about it I didn't think that I'd like it. I decided to borrow it as it was a free choice. It took about three chapters to hook me,but once  it did I couldn't put it down. When I finished I promptly got the next book in the series. I'm a Hunger Games convert!
When someone told me they thought I might like this book, I was skeptical at first. I normally don't read books like this, or that's what I thought. I couldn't put it down. It was loaned to me and now I MUST read the next on. Without going into details that will give away the book, I just want to say.....this was an excellent read!
Collins explores the theme of a violence-craving society expertly, and the characters that have to go through various trials react realistically. The effects of a ruthless authoritarian government are crystal clear. This has made the novel an instant classic that will surely be taught in high school English a half century from now.
All in all I must say that I truly enjoyed reading this book. I am 29 years old and was skeptical of reading a book seemingly geared towards teens. Gotta say I was pleasantly surprised. There was just enough action and romance to keep me going. I enjoyed the characters but would have liked to see them developed a little bit better.
I kept hearing about this book, which made me not want to read it. My friend got it for my birthday so I decided to read it before seeing the movie. I must've finished it in 6 hours total. Wanted to find out what happened so I got the other two books. Can't wait to finish them!  Good read if you like man vs. society plot.
When I first heard about The Hunger Games, I was weary of reading a book that people have made such a hype about. I decided to read it anyway and was amazed at the book. I couldn't stop reading it! The trilogy is amazing. Buy it asap! The characters are well developed and quite relatable to. Its a great read for both young and old.
This book series is awesome! I ended up reading all 3 books in 4 days! I also gave them to my 13 year old stepdaughter who loved them as well! A must read! Also once you read the first one you will be hooked and want to read all 3. I would just buy all three to begin with if you can so your not waiting for them to come in the mail!
I bought this book used from the seller. When receiving the book I had low expectations on the condition of the book. Upon receiving the book it was in almost PERFECT CONDITION. With the exception of a little shelf wear, I would never had known that this book was used at all!!!! Very happy with the overall outcome of the purchase.
Again all I can say is wow!  I love this book it is wonderfully writen. It has action, adventure, polical intrigue, and yes romance.  I could not put this book and never have I been this excited about a book since Harry Potter and Twilight.  I can't wait for the next book to find out what will happen to Katniss "The Girl on Fire."
No matter what age you are, no matter what gender you are, no matter if it normally takes you a year to finish a book, I promise you will not be able to put this book down. Action, romance, political corruption, all with a frightening realism underlying it all, clash together in an edge-of-your-seat story that demands to be read.
This book is like no other book made. The book is the best book I have ever read. I could not even put the book down it was so good. You have to read this book. If I can have my sister read the Hunger Games I can make you read it. The pages will hook you from the start it happend to me it can happen to you. Read The Hunger Games!
My teenage daughter insisted I read this and, I admit, it had me engrossed from start to finish. This is the first person account of a young girl in a post-Apocalyptic world who volunteers as "tribute" from her district to participate in what is essentially a reality TV show, The Hunger Games. Twenty-four kids, ranging in age from 12-18, representing 12 districts in what was once North America, are primped and prepared to fight to the death in a wilderness arena. They must find their own food and water, shelter, weaponry and companionship. Only one will survive and return home a hero.  Reading The Hunger Games was like watching a gorier version of the television show Survivor. It included both loathsome and likeable players, alliances, back-stabbing, solid friendships and even a love story.  Katniss and Peeta are the girl and boy from District 12, who their mentors and stylists present to the viewing audience as star-crossed lovers. Peeta is actually in love with Katniss; however, she is a hard-nosed, focused hunter and only believes she's playing a role through the Games. For example, she has been instructed that every kiss she gives Peeta may result in a reward, or some kind of treat or necessity from her mentor/sponsors. That the reader is aware of Peeta's true feelings and Katniss is not, is part of what makes it a simplistic and even silly love story. But I think that's testimony to the genius of the author. It magnifies how reality TV can be both inane and riveting at the same time.  I believe it was the good writing and the author's technique/story-telling ability that made me turn the pages non-stop until I finished. As for the subject matter? File this one under "guilty pleasure."
I heard of these books from my co-workers before the movie came out.  They all were so engrossed that I thought I had to see for myself.  Loved the book and was able to read it in just a few days.  Found myself reading it whenever I had a spare moment.  Great book and I was very eager to continue reading the rest of the trilogy.
Loved this book!!! I completely devoured this action packed, post-distruction-of-the-world, love story. Suzanne Collins is a wonderful writer and gives each of her characters such defined personalities which hold true till the end. As soon as I flipped the last page I jumped on Amazon and pre-ordered the sequel, Catching Fire.
Suzanne Collins wrote a fantastic work in her Hunger Games series.  While the book started out targeted to a young adult audience, the dystopian aspects will appal to the adult reader as well. The series is particularly good for reluctant readers since the readability and pacing encourages the reader to continue with the story.
This book was amazing.  It had me hooked from the second I picked it up.  Maybe because I didn't expect to like it as much as I did (I read it because my bookclub was reading it) -- but I was truely wow'd.  The storyline is great, the character development is rich, and the writing was superb. I can't wait to read the other two.
This book far outweighed my expectations. I ecpected it to be more geared toward teens and younger children but it suprised in that the story was very well written and kept you invested in the characters the entire time. I wasnted to read it before I saw any of the movies to get the background first and I was not disappointed.
I'm really into dystopian novels like 1984, brave new world, the road, etc. Although this is geared toward a younger audience, I found it was a lot more grown up than i expected. I was worried I wouldn't get into it after the first chapter, but after that I couldn't put it down. The story surges ahead with nail biting action.
I had heard that this was about kids dying so I didn't have any interest in it or go and see the movie. A friend at work convinced me that I should read it so I gave it a go. I could not put it down. It was great! I really want to read the next 2 books but they are not available on Kindle yet! Have to get them some other way.
This had an excellent, unique premise and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout. The setting is dark and dreary, which gets depressing if read for too long, but the suspense is second to none and there's little "predictability" in this one. Post-Apocalyptic America is not a pleasant place to be, especially for a teenager.
Loved Loved Loved The Hunger Games!  Definitely one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I finished the book in a weekend which is very rare for me...all I wanted to do was sit and read...I could not put it down.  I started the book and was immediately sucked in to the life of Katniss and the world of Panem.  Read it.
Have to say, the best book I`ve read in ages, I`m 65years old and really thought I would not like it, how wrong was I, took hold of me right from the start, could not put it down, beautifully written, easy to read, and a very compelling and believable storyline. Am about to start book 2 now, can`t wait, will keep you posted
I never liked this sort of story before, but saw it on Stephanie Meyer's website, so i thought i'd give it a try. It was amazing until the very last page. I couldn't put it down. The only thing that was wrong with it was that it turned out to be part of a series. So now i have to wait who knows how long to see what happens.
I really don't like reading books. I am 24 and before I read this I didn't complete a book since I was 15. So many people were talking about this series that I decided to give it a try. This book is awesome!!! As good as Harry potter for sure. I highly recomend this book to anyone who is interested in it. Good for any age.
This book is one of the best I have ever read. I have read it more than once now and still can't get over how much I still completely adore it. It left me wondering how the author could do such a good job on a story like that. I recommend reading this if you have read the Divergent books, they are similar in a lot of ways.
I enjoyed the Hunger Games  as much as possible for a retired person in his 60s.  A few too many deus ex machina twists to merit a higher rating from me.  I mainly wanted to see what the fuss was about in the younger set.  The fact I made it to the end is a positive for this book--it just wasn't written for my demographic.
My grandson started reading this book. Of course I thought it was just for teenagers. My 30 something daughter-in-law told me she read it and found it to be an interesting read for her. I thought what the heck I'll at least give it a try. I actually found it rather entertaining. I'm now looking forward to seeing the movie.
I loved the plot, specially that it wasn't like anything I've read before. Some things didn't go as you expected (or wanted) them to, but that was one of the beauties of it.  The descriptions of everything, from the garments to the hair and make-up or the scenery... was amazing!  I didn't expect to love it so much.
The Hunger Games is about a girl names Katniss who volunteers for her sister Prim at the 74th annual Hunger Games (where a boy and a girl from each district will be selected/forced to particpate in Hunger Games and fight till one person is standing alive). The Hunger Games is filled with action,romance and some friendship.
This book kept me reading and reading. I could not stop. The premise is new and refreshing. Having children fight to survive, even kill. This is something new that most people don't even want to think about, but the author does a splendid job with it. By adding humor and love to the story. Who will Katniss love in the end?
I don't have much to contribute since I'm not in the mood to write a detailed book review. I will just say that I am a sci-fi/fantasy nerd who enjoys things like Buffy, Joss Whedon, Twilight, Sookie Stackhouse series, LOTR, Eureka, Vampire Diaries, etc. and I plowed through this whole trilogy. And can't wait for the movie!
i luv this book at first it was confusing but i kept on reading and got it. i am goingto buy catching fire and mocking jay too. i felt bad for katniess because of her burns during the games and her pants and jacket caught on fire. that would be scary. i luv this book. sad though too. go hunger games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
The Hunger Games is a gripping read. It's a story fueled by morally gray decisions based on survial. Primal instinct is brought to the forefront but not without the heartbreaking sacrifices characters must make in the end. The plot remains simple throughout yet tightens towards the fantastic climax leaving you riveted.
A phenomenal adventure that will both bring you to tears and bring you joy. So much heart, friendship, and strength that will show you to never give up and to carry your self through all of the hardship of life, or The Hunger Games. This is my favorite book and I have suggested it to all of my friends and family. Enjoy!
This book certainly deserves a five star rating. Typically I am not quite as enthusiastic when I read a book after having seen the movie. This book is so well written I was unable to put it down. I Would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys an action-filled adventure that will have your heart racing.  Kim
I was not sure about these books, but once i started reading I could not put them down! so interesting, and good plot and characters!! if you need a good read the hunger games are a good book for you, and even though they are considered  for younger  target, it is still for all ages and genders!!   Love these books!!!
I seriously have to say that the hunger games trilogy is hands down the best series ever!!! im sorry for all you haters who dont understand the meaning of these series. Collins captured Romance, comedy, action, and fiction into her books. The movie was great as well. So yay and go hunger games cheerers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My co-worker told me to read this book a year ago and I was not really interested. Not until I saw the previews for the movie and heard the hype did I read it. I read it in three days. Very hard to put down. I'm on the second book now and just as exciting! You can't go wrong with this one. So glad I decided to read it!
This is a riveting story from the very first page. You fall in love with the characters and really feel their emotions translated through the writing. The story is original, fast paced and action filled. I really enjoyed the first book in this series. Read my other two reviews for my thoughts as the series progresses.
Friends told me that I should read this book but I put it off because I don't usually read the 'trendy' books.  However, it was available at the Kindle Lending Library so I checked it out.  The book was so well written and had such a great story line that I finished the book in one evening.  Now to finish the others...
A really enjoyable read.  Great characters, exciting action and well thought out.  If a book entertains me, keeps me wanting to turn the pages and wipes my mind of my daily grind then I am a happy customer!  I found myself cheering for the success of the characters and look forward to reading the others in the series.
I loved this book so much. The premise has me thinking and intrigued and I want to read more. I can understand completely why this book is so popular now. Dystopian novels are by far my favorite and this category fits into it perfectly. I cannot wait to see how the second book starts because of the way this book ended
I read this a while ago, before the movies started coming out, and it was just one of those books that made you lie awake at night thinking about the characters and the world. It was a super quick read, which I usually like, I only wished there were a little more details on the world, but overall it was a solid read.
this book has you hooked after the first fifty pages it starts off with katniss little sister prim getting selcted into the seventy forth hunger games. then the fun begins and all i can say read with your mouth ready to be opened and have your jaw drop because this story will make you cry and or leave you in amazment
I caved and decided to read the books when news of the first movie came out.  I was surprised at how twisted the book is.  If you've seen the movies, the first book is better than the movie.  There is too much inner dialogue that the movie couldn't include.  The second book was on par with the movie; both were good.
I never intended to read these books but my daughter talked me into it and I am so glad she did! I was Hooked almost right away and have now read all 3! The book was captivating and held me spellbound thru the whole thing! I was torn in who Katniss should choose to love! You have to read these books, young or old!!!
A literary masterpiece  Definitely one of the greats  The only thing I recommend is that you only read the first book, because the end of the second book will make you want to read the third book, and at the end of the third book... Well, no spoilers  The Hunger Games is absolutely in a class of its own
These books were so amazing. I am a huge fan of both the movies and books and I am proud to say these were possibly the best books I have read. Once you begin you can never stop. I have read the books so many times I have lost track. If you haven't read these or are in need of a book I highly recommend them. Enjoy.
YA novels aren't normally my thing but I finally broke down and read the first book on my niece's recommendation. I have to say that I was completely surprised by how captivating each main character was portrayed especially trying to understand or predict their motivations. I would definitely recommend this book :)
That was surely the best book I have ever read in my life I am about to read the second book, Catching Fire. I will be epic!!! Even my friend is reading this book for real I love it it's a lot of fun and adventures in it,I think everyone likes it. Go katniss and peeta!!!read this book unless you are not allowed to.
If you haven't seen the movie, then the book isn't spoiled for you.  The book is way better than the movie, and well written.  That is often the case, though not always, as some books are not good, but the movie about them is good.  Read the book, there is so much more information in the telling and not the seeing.
I have read this book after the movie which sort of helped me situate the action and characters. But that is about all what the movie did for me. There is so much more in the book, so many details that make the story much more interesting than I was actually expecting.  So, it is time to get to the next one...
This is a well written adventure tale for young adults. It is set in a post apocalyptic America where the population is virtually enslaved. It features the adventures of the contestants in a reality show which pits twenty four children against each other in a fight to the death. A refreshing change from vampires!
the movie made it more worthy to finish all three books, but team Peeta reigns! the movie made me anxious to see or read what would happen next..and me and my friends wont stop talking about it...this may be the only book i will never forget..and i will always have it memorized..line by line and scene by scene ..
Some of the best books about children, some that qualify as "juvenile literature," are the ones that aren't just for children. With Suzanne Collins' dark, delicious book THE HUNGER GAMES, I found another great read, one that reminded me of Orson Scott Card's ENDER'S GAME or Robert Cormier's AFTER THE FIRST DEATH.
I expected blood and gore and violent fighting.  Instead there is thoughtfulness, affection, violence mostly at a distance, and humor.  I generally enjoy more conversation, but sharing  her thoughts is more interesting than talk.  I will recommend this book to friends who would not usually read anything like it.
I didn't expect this book to be a as good as it was. I didn't even see the movie until a few days ago.  The Hunger Games is very well written and from the first page, I could not put it down.  Only took me about a day to read the whole book.  I would recommend it to anyone and I think that any age will enjoy it.
I. LOVED. IT!!!  Mind you, I am not the "target audience" of this book, or perhaps the original target bc it has really taken off. In any event, I could not get enough of it and it was hard to out down when I had to go to sleep to wake up in time for work!! A great read and a wonderful story !
I'm not a big reader, but this book was so intriguing I read it in two sittings, never wanting to put it down. A savage, yet almost plausible, story line with a twist of romance is sure to keep your attention. The only reason I'm writing this review is because I'm waiting for book two to download to my android.
Buyer Beware--You probably won't be able to put this book down once you start it.  I've never read a book quite like this with twists and turns, despair and happiness throughout.  Highly recommend!  As soon as I finished I really wanted to know what would happen to Katniss, Peeta, and the rest of the characters
I was not in a mental place to read this when it came out. I was happy, getting married, etc. now that life calmed down, I picked up these books to read. Omg. I am totally in love with Peeta for Katniss. And the survival, shell shocked feeling was so overwhelming. This is an amazing book. I highly recommend it
This is not a book I would usually read.  However, I so thoroughly enjoyed this one that I am looking forward to reading the rest of this trilogy.  It was a definite five for me.  The only problem I had was that this is a trilogy.  As this was a stand-alone book, I can't complain about this, though.  Loved it!
When asked I say it was a love story.  But the story surrounding our hero's is a cruel one and one you can't wait for a rebellion to happen to free the people from their tomentors.  I no sooner finished than bought the sequel.  Now I am stuck waiting for the finale.  I may get the DVDs to compare to the books.
I picked up this book when I saw that it was recommended by the author of the Host (and Twilight series) at the time I was not reading a lot of this genre and was not sure about it. I was made a believer this book ROCKS! I love Katniss an her ability to keep trying because people she loves are counting on her.
Loved it, but thought it wasn't really a childrens book with all the sytlized violence, but as an adult I thought it was very involved and it sucked me right into the story until the very end.  I thought the end wasn't very clean, for me it still left things up in the air as if there was another book to come.
I couldn't put it down!! This is the first book in a long time that I've devoured in a day! I fell in love with the characters and I was immersed in the suspense and terror and action of the Games. I just finished the third book and I'm about to re-read them! I wish there were more books out there like this!
I am an avid reader - a book a week - and I enjoyed this book more than many others I have read. It was a well-conceived story that was unpredictable with characters that are loveable and detestable. What more can you ask for than to be entertained with a book you can't put down that leaves you wanting more.
I picked this book up on a whim and was not disappointed. The evening I began reading, I could not put it down. I had to find out what would happen to Kat and her star crossed lover story. Finally finishing at 2:30 am, I was fulfilled with the stoy and look forward to reading it again. I can't wait for more!
If you weren't too sure about the movie then I say give the book a chance. It's almost like a woman rewrote Orwell's 1984, throwing the characters into a Gladiator arena and decided to make three books. The Hunger Games stands alone as a great novel but as a trilogy it makes for a haunting dystopian series.
The Hunger Games is the only book that has ever been able to fill the void that Harry Potter's ending has created in my life. Such a fantastic series. I couldn't take my co-workers seriously after reading this; all i wanted to say was "you think you've got problems? KATNISS has got some problems"...
A gripping story with a female protagonist's character carved out beautifully. The love angle is interesting. I will never forget he characters of the novel, such is the beauty of the writer. It leaves you asking for more. The details, the logics used to explain the situations are realistic and convincing.
It was amazing. I loved how Katniss is not a person who is all about the romance, but she cares about her family. I was impressed by how well the book was written. Because it took the reader back to when the character was a little kid, so that really helped explain the story. Five stars it was magnificent!
So being the 8,908th person to review this book does feel slightly pointless, but here goes anyway... This is one of the best genre books (any genre) that I've read in a long while; the writing is terrific, the ideas fabulous, the characters always engaging and it thoroughly deserves it's success. Read it.
I have a high respect for the way the writer built the story's concept and flaw. However, I expected better exploration of the themes included in the book, better complexity of the plot and of course a greater attachment to the main characters. I bought the second book but I'm not in that hurry to read it.
Once the far-fetched dystopia is accepted, this can be appreciated as a complex grow-up-fast-and-deal-with-it tale. Though it's told from the perspective of a teenage girl, this story touches feelings and perspectives that any reader can relate to.  It was hard to put down and will remain hard to forget.
Shocking and sad...I was so sad when little Rue died and glad that Katmiss didn't have to face her in a fight..I felt bad about all the deaths Kat.miss . was so clever and strong and Peers so open and sensitive . A horrible thing to do to children...I can't wait until the Capital is destroyed...good read
I loved the Hunger Games series. Twisted, disturbing plots, but Collins keeps the readers' interest from start to finish. I believe it's supposed to be a Young Adult or Young Readers series, this adult still found the books to be a good read. Much better than the movies (and the movies were pretty good)!
When I heard about the premise of this series,I was very skeptical...a story about 10-17 year olds fighting to the death? But a friend convinced me to try it....I read all three books in 4 days! They are completely addicting hey pull you into the story,and don't let you go.I highly recommend these books!
I read this book so fast the first time I missed a lot if details.  It's a bizzare read b/c it's about something so horrific, but the book allows the reader to move beyond what's happening and get sucked up into Katniss and her life, emotions, thinking,  and justification for her every move.  Great read!
This was a great read. Could not put the book down for a second. My husband read it after me and read it in one night :) I''m a historical Fiction buff so this was not my normal style of book but I really really enjoyed it. The second one not as much and the 3rd even less but this one was a winner for me
Took me awhile to want to read the Hunger Games, due to it being about children fighting to the death. But thought I would give it one try and I was completely surprised that I could not stop reading. Now I'm reading the 2nd book Catching Fire. Then I will read the last one and finally watch the movies.
This was an interesting first person style story.  The balance of action and introspection was good with nicely developed characters.  With the current jobs situation where Washington DC keeps getting richer and the heartland loses more and more jobs, this book gets more politically interesting.
This  book is a page turner and is so amazing by the time  I finished  this book I had to  read the others. They were definitley worth reading. you have to uncover the adventures you will take with Katniss. I just can't sum it up in one word. this book is good  i wsh suzane collins would make a fourth!!
You can read the other reviews that are much more captivating, but I just wanted to say that this was an amazing book that kept the reader engaged from start to finish. Part of it is ruined given that you can figure out there are two more books, but it's how it happens that keeps you reading.  Yay book
I'd been having a hard time finding a book that captured my attention. I'd read a few chapters and then never go back to it. This book had me hooked from page one, I couldn't put it down!! The book is perfectly paced and action-packed. I can't wait to read the second book and so on. Highly recommend!!
It's been a while since I was so wrapped up in a book.  I quickly purchased the 2nd and 3rd books after finishing the hunger games.  I knew that if I couldin't put that book down, I surely wasn't going to put the others down either. I found myself sneaking away from others to read! :)  great trilogy!
This series was so much fun to read!  Book 1 lays the foundation for my favorite of the series, book 2.  It is action packed and I found my self finishing it in less than a day.  I saw the movie as well, and the book and movie are very close; of course the book provides a bit more insight and detail.
I had resisted reading this book until a friend who knows my taste in reading recommended it.  I think I read it in 2 sittings!  I thought it was well-written and certainly held my interest.  I've just started #2 and expect to like it as well... and I am not a teenager - I have teenage grandchildren.
I admit to having seen the movie before I ever read the book. Even knowing the story line and having seen the movie multiple times, I couldn't put this book down. It is well written, the characters have so much life and detail to them. And as it should be - the book is so much better than the movie!
Not a fan of fantasy novels, I decided to read THE HUNGER GAMES only because it was so popular, and so talked about. I was hooked.  The plot moved along at a rapid pace, and I found myself totally engrossed with the character Katniss. The novel surprised me and I surprised myself.  A wonderful read.
A client of mine recommended this book. I am not usually interested in science fiction or fantasy but I decided to give it a shot. I was captivated from the very first page. Never have I read a book that just sucked me in to its depths and made me search so deeply within myself. It changed my world.
I love the imagery Suzanne collins evokes in the hunger games. This book takes me away to panem and I got so engrossed in the story and involved with the characters I couldn't put it down.  An incredible futuristic tale that made me think and take a good look at myself. This is a definate must read.
This book is popular for a reason! I read the series right before the movies came out and I am glad I did. The end of each chapter makes you want to read what is next, the book pulls you in and you have to force yourself to put it down. I really enjoyed this book even though it was a crazy concept.
I gave this book 5 stars because you NEVER get tired of it, you just don't get bored in any moment and by analyzing the story, you can compare how similar Panem and the real world are; both separeted grups: the rich in the Capitol, and those who depend totally on them: the people from the districts
Gripping - I could not stop reading.  Didn't plan to read it because I was bored with all the hype about the movie; so glad I decided to ignore that and get the book finally.  Such a detailed, amazing plot, with amazing characters - and the characters all have good and bad points (like all people).
I love this movie, so I decided to pick up the book. It's an easy read, and I'm totally wrapped up in the story from beginning to end. Having seen the movie beforehand, the scenery in my head as I move from one page to the next is just as it was presented in the movie - not a bad problem to have!!
I cannot describe how much I enjoyed this book.  I can't even begin to tell you what it's about.  I ask that you try and read it and if after 20 pages you have absolutely no interest, it's not for you.  But let me tell you that everyone who followed my advice has read and loved the entire trilogy.
I've read all three books before, and loved them. Now I am reading them all over again. This time to my husband who will not pick up a book to save his life. I think I am beginning to open his eyes to the joy and excitement books can bring to your life...... Only time will tell. Fingers crossed.
I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK/KINDLE READING DOWN.  IT GRABBED FROM THE GET GO AND I DID NOT THINK  I WOULD LIKE THIS BOOK.  MY GRANDSON TOLD ME I  WOULD LIKE IT....I HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE TRAILERS  AND THOUGHT 'NO WAY'  BUT IT IS A VERY GOOD AND  THRILLING READ....RECOMMEND IT!!!!
This is a really good book. There is alot of action and I never put it down! I loved it. The action in it is so descriptive, I saw it through the book. I can`t wait for the movie to come out. I like the unique setting of the future, and suggest it to any reader that likes action, and suspense!
Everyone is raving about this novel, and for good reason. It's worth raving about. Kudos to this author for bringing this world to life, for better or for worse. Sometimes "hype" has a way of back-firing and tarnishing a work of substance. Very glad to see that Hunger Games is worth the praise.
I just finished the series for a second time and I am so in love with all of Suzanne's books! The Hunger Games gives a sense of sisterly love and protection, which is then extremely heartfelt in the arena with Katniss and Peeta. I cant wait to see the movies and decide which I like best!!!!!!!
Ok I love this book, the violence and the action. But Suzanne Collins You are a copier. You copied off of Battle Royale. So you watched the movie or read the book. Then you took the idea changed it a little bit then CALLED THE IDEA YOU'RE OWN! That's not cool!But I still love your book series!
This movie shows what can happen when we give up our rights for "safety and security" to the government. The government way oversteps their bounds and the people become prisoners. Excellent teaching tool for use with a younger generation in teaching about freedom, rights, and slavery.
I started reading this because you can't be critical of what you don't know.  Once I got started it was hard to put down. I didn't like that children are the subject of national punishment, but it was well played. Now I am trying to decide if I will continue to the next book. It seems a must.
This story is riveting and I just couldn't put it down. Each page left me wanting more. I recommend it to absolutely everyone and I can't wait to read the sequel. Both my daughters told me it was an excellent read even though they both know it is not my normal genera. Bot it is truly orbiting
This is not a genre I usually read, so I was a little reluctant to give The Hunger Games a try, even though it got so many 5 star reviews, but it was totally deserving of every one of them!  This book was so good, I couldn't put it down! I totally got lost in the story. Definitely recommend!
I love this  book. One night I was up till midnight reading it. It is the best book ever. I love how it makes you think Katniss loves Peeta but then you think not.  This book would be suitable for people who are aged between 13 and 30 who like action adventure books and a bit of romance.
I was not interested on the theme of "Hunger Games"; however, I had to read this book for a class. I never thought that I would get so captured for the story. It got my attentin right away and I could stop reading it. After that I had to watch the movie because I changed my opinion.
So easy to read and get into, you won't want to put it down for a minute. I'm always keeping an eye out for books my husband will like and this is one for sure. This is a great book for readers that love action and don't want to feel bored when reading. I can't wait to read the second book!
This was a very intriguing story of a young girl who braves a brutal adventure. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for sure and I have the second book ready to go! I loved the characters and the imagery-you could really see the landscape and feel what she was feeling thruoghout the book.
I didn't like the first few chapters of "Hunger Games" - the premise being too barbaric for me and the thought of young kids reading this and enjoying it bothers me. I can't get past other "popular" novels like the Stephen King one.  Where oh where is a really well written, good story book?
I thought this book was amazing. It's one of the few to be able to capture my attention after the Twilight series. Most every book i've read after Twilight has been stuck in its shadow, but this book holds it's own. I definitely reccomend it to anyone who is interested in adventure stories.
Although I do not like the premise of children fighting to the death for food, this story is actually about the effects of was on children,  I found it difficult to put it down. The descriptions are exquisite. Now, I'm on book two because I want to find out how the government continues their torture..
This book took hold of me right from the start. Katniss is a character you want to get behind and that you want to WIN. Collins does an amazing job of making her believable and sympathetic and totally relateable to both girls and guys. It's a great job of crossing the gender barrier in YA!
I LOVED IT!! it was the most sentimental, beautiful and upsetting book i have ever read. I finishef within a course of a week. Some parts weren't as sad or creepy to me as other people would find it. I especially hated the part where Katness had to fake being in love with Peeta. So, yeah.
I really enjoyed this book. It's certainly an easy read but it's good for any age (preteen to adult)! The main character is a strong female character amidst a very sad and controlled world. It's full of action and drama. Plus it has a lot more to it than the movie has! Highly recommended.
My granddaughters asked me to read this book.  Now I know they love me, this is one wonderful book, whether you are an adult or a teenager.  The book has heart, angst, and enough action to keep anyone happy.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, the reason I'm giving this book 5 stars.
My daughter loves these books and begged me to read them so we could talk about them.  I truly wish she had never read them in the first place!  Yes, the other reviewers are correct, the books are bloody and barbaric and wholly inappropriate.  But the main problem is that this is a poorly written rehashing of a million other stories, some of them not very good in the first place.  **SPOILERS**  Katniss is a worse heroine than Bella Swan, entirely unlikable and irritating as a narrator.  The love triangle is not set up properly, Gale is a completely static character throughout the first and second books, leaving the reader to wonder why on earth she would consider him over Peeta.  Peeta is unbelievable as a character because his devotion to Katniss is so sorely misplaced.  Collins' idea is compelling at first, but ultimately goes nowhere.  With no growth or maturity on the part of the narrator the reader's view of this alien world is stunted and shallow.  She mistrusts and thinks poorly of everyone else, so naturally we come to not believe her instincts as they are proven wrong time and time again, thus rendering plot twists mundane and expected.  The conclusion is the lowest blow of all.  It is perhaps the worst ending since, "and then I woke up".  This is, unfortunately, a recurring theme throughout the books; Katniss is rendered unconscious for hours or days and afterward is told of the important and world changing events that happened while she was sleeping or hiding or drugged.  Go find something else worthy of reading-Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, Brandon Sanderson, Anne McCaffrey, Ray Bradbury.  Even James Patterson is better than this!
I enjoyed reading the book more than having already seen the movie. I must admit that reading the book after the movie helped me to visualize the characters and the situations in which they were involved. The book and movie fairly closely. both very entertaining with a message for today.
I don't typically read books unless there is a movie component to compare them to. The Hunger Games (Book 1) was the most fully immersed I'd gotten in a book ever in my life.  This isn't just for kids and can be read at any age and enjoyed! I simply couldn't put this book down.
Suzanne Collins sucked me in from the first page creating a world full of real characters and thoughtful situations. It was also nice to see such a strong female protagonist. I've read it more than once and purchased the other two books one after the other. Some of the best YA I've read.
I feel everyone has fantasized about this scenario one time or another. It did a very good job in keeping the audience entertained.  The pace was spot on and just an all around good book... I highly recommend this to anyone.  High five stars and hoped the last two books were just as good
This book was just amazing. The movie can not be compared to the description, and beautiful pictures painted in you head. It explains things so clearly, and you just can't set this book down.  AMAZING  FANTASTIC  BEAUTIFUL  READ THE SERIES, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!
I wasn't so sure I would like this.  Not really into Sci-FI.  Once you get past the first couple of chapters, you are hooked.  Very clever and creatively written.  Good story for a young adult - not too young tough, as some of the storylines are tough to take in.  Definitely recommend!
Hunger Games is such a great story.  It is hard to imagine living in a world such as portrayed in Hunger Games but the author does a good job of making it seem a reality! The reader is engaged, thrilled, and curious to see what the ending will bring. Highly recommend this book to read!
The Hunger games was literally the best book I have ever read. The romance and the fighting was amazing I had no idea that someone could write a book the good. It made me sad at night and happy this is the best book ever I'm going to read every single book. You should read HungerGames.
I found this book very original, interesting, entertaining, and thought-provoking. The second it ended, I tried to look up the sequel and was very disappointed to learn it won't come out for months :( I reserve 5-star ratings for books I don't want to put down and this was one of them.
Gear book if you like the hunger games movies. The books provide more details and substance the the movies. You understand Katniss and her relationship with her parents more (which they don't mention so much in the movies). I love the movies too though. So far I've read all the books.
I keep seeing this book being rated 2 or 3 stars! WHAT THE HECK! I think this is a AWSOME BOOK! I have read a lot of good books. But this was the BEST I have ever read! Suzanne Collins has done a great job! I wish I could give this book 100 stars! I will always be a Hunger Games fan!
I loved reading this story through the lead characters perspective.  Even though I had seen the movie twice, the book is so rich with detail and the main character's voice that I found myself incapable of putting it down.  I highly recommend this book even if you have seen the movie.
I don't normally read the book because I don't want it to ruin the movie...  I felt the book added to what I remember of the movie and developed the characters more fully.  I'm not one to get sucked into a book, but I couldn't seem to put this one down. Fantastic.
I feel like the last person in the world to read this book. I saw the movie for the first time a few days ago and thought the book might be worth a perusal. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it (as much as one can, given the subject  matter). Looking forward to the next installment.
I avoided getting involved with the Hunger Games books for almost a year, fearing that it was another fad book like Twilight that was just going to be silly. I really like this series. It actually becomes a bit political, which I found interesting. Suzanne Collins is a great author.
Why this is a teenage series is beyond me. I started reading the series when i saw the announcement that movie was being made. It is a very interesting postapocalyptic series with a violence and the characters go through a lot of trauma. Very well written, definitely worth the read.
Hunger Games is a futuristic survivor game with national TV coverage, Gamemakers, etc; however, these are teens fighting to the death. I read it as a book club choice. It is well-written and a good read. The two following books of the trilogy are a must read to get the whole story.
This book was awesome, read it way before the movie was in the thought of making.  The book is way better than the movie, of course more detail and so much the modern movie left out.  Read the rest of the series... and this review is coming from a person who barely reads any books.
Saw the movie first and loved it. Then I read the book, I think that's the way I'll do it from now on. If I read a book first then see the movie I'm always disappointed. This way I like them equally. Of course the book is better. More in depth but I'm not disappointed in the movie.
I gave this novel a 5 because it will undoubtedly be a novel that outlives the bestseller list and will be discussed, enjoyed and re-read for generations to come.  For anyone who loved 1984, Fahrenheit 451, etc., this may be a modern day classic that you can appreciate.
I heard about this book before ordering this.  To my surprise, this was excellent reading material.  Once I started, I couldn't put down this book.  The condition of this book was very good.  I am very pleased with the services this vendor provided to me.  thank you very much
I'm a mid-50's woman and found the series to be a terrific read. If your kids have them around, I highly suggest taking the time to read them... Excellent storyline and reminded me of morals alluded to in Lord of the Flies. Just what will people do for their families and society?
Hunger games was exciting, thrilling and suspenceful. Just when I thought had plot figured out was amazed that I  didn't...an awesome book...going to start second one soon. Can't wait to follow Katniss through here next challenge.  Great read...didn't want to put it down.
a very good book. i love the plot and the confused romance that goes on in the book. the way katniss and peeta are star-crossed lovers gets me more interested in the book to see how their relationship works out. the end of book 1 is sad though cuz peeta thinks katniss only acted.
'The Hunger Games' was, overall, a great book. For a post-apocalyptic story, Suzanne Collins captured the surreality of it quite well. But, no one can replicate the story and drama of George Orwell's '1984'. Either way, 'The Hunger Games' was a good read and I would recommend it.
What a horrible story told in the most human and compassionate of ways. The events of the book unfold leaving you stunned at this interpretation of the future. The more the story hints at and explains how this all came to be the more you start to believe it really could happen.
You will love this book. I'm a big reader, and if you ever read Eragon, Rangers Apprentice, Pendragon, The fire within, any of these book series will be right up your alley. I am severely in love with peeta, and have reread this series 3 times, because this is just amazing!!!!!
Suzanne Collins gives us a breathtaking sc-fi thriller that is hard to put down. She never exploits the violence. She gives us a futuristic dystopian novel that explores its totalitarianism's cruel society that joins classics like 1984, Fahrenheit 451 and Animal Farm. Brilliant
I loved the amount of detail in the book, enough to paint you a mental picture while still managing to let your imagination fill in the rest. The characters were heartfelt and true to life, young but not annoyingly so. This will be one of those books I compare future reads to.
This book is absolutley amazing. The characters are real and we care about them. The plot is hookimg and suepensful. And even though I've never been in love with present tense narration, I loved it here. Thamk you, Suzanne Collins, for making me fall in love with a new series.
For Young Adult eh?  Well I am 58 years old and absolutely loved the book, so I must be in my second childhood.  The writing and character development is amazing and it's the best book I've read in ages.  Have already begun book 2 and am loving that also.  Can't wait for the movie in March 2012
Several friends raved about this book for months, but I out off reading it until we went on vacation. I couldn't wait to pick it up every day! As gruesome and sickening as the story could be, the storytelling was great, and the love story sweet. Can't wait to read number two!
I watched the film several times before reading this, and the scenes parallel very well. The movie captured many parts well, and allows the imagination to expand the movie to fit the book's descriptions. Can't wait to compare Catching Fire to the movie coming out in 10 days!!
This book was one of the best books I've ever read. I had so many emotions that I wanted to scream laugh cry and wish Katniss would realize ovios things. Read this amazing book and go realize what Katniss Everdeen went through. I also recommend the other books in this seires.
I've always wanted to love reading, and up until this point it's just be a leisurely activity to me. Now though I am ready to dedicate a lot more time into reading. Thanks to this book for helping me find my inner passion. Great read start to finish. I recommend this to all.
I have to admit......this book is great.  I have heard all my friends and family saying "you have to read it" and I finally gave in.  Well......they were absolutely right!  It draws you in from the beginning and makes it hard to put the book down.  Very, VERY good!
Even after the 20+ times I have read this book, it's still as thrilling as ever. If you have seen the movie, but have not read the book you will fall in love with these characters all over again! Amazing work by a very talented and creative author. Kudos to Suzanne Collins!
This is a great summer read. The characters are compelling.  The action non-stop. Readers will be turning pages late into the night to see what happens next. I can't wait for the sequel!  While classified as a young adult book, this is a book that adults will enjoy as well.
I honestly can't see the why anyone would give this book a good review.  The book is about 320 pages long.  The first 150 pages were used to develop the main character who seemed even more unfamiliar as the story rolled along.  The author claims to have gotten her idea for the book from contemporary research.  This is a lie, whether she or her publisher admits it or not.  The book too closely resembles the premise of Battle Royale.  Actually, towards the end of Hunger Games I started wondering, why was the author including a love story plot to the book that, up to that point, was devoid of such an idea.  After reading Battle Royale, I saw why.  However, Collins was extremely less successful in developing her characters (which were a handful) then the Japanese author (which were many).  I know there are alot of Collin's fans that would like to hunt me down after this review but I have to be honest.  Her idea was stolen and if you don't believe me, read Battle Royale.  I guarantee you will come to the same conclusion.
This book was great, it was sad but it was something you couldn't put down. It kept you on the edge of your seat . I read it in 5 days. I was so caught up in it, I stayed up till 1:00am. I loved how detailed it was, and how it explained everything that Katniss was feeling.
The original story was refreshing. My favorite story has been Harry Potter for a quarter of my life. The Hunger Games has tied for my affection. After I finished this series the first time I couldn't help but want more. Another good series is the Gregor books from Collins.
Reading a book as popular as the reviews I had high hopes for the book. The beginning seemed slow but once the games were brought into view it picked up. Although set for young readers I'd recommend the book to anyone, and if you haven't seen the movie read the book first.
I've bought this book on Kindle because of the movie trailer and the rating it got here - it seemed like a fair book.  It didn't really prepare me for what was in the book. I couldn't stop reading it until it ended.  It was one of the best books I've read in the past year.
This book was very interesting. The action incredible, and the suspense in between makes you keep reading until the book's done. I found Katniss's concern with relationships a little strange, yet her aloofness to Peeta further confused me. Still though, very entertaining.
I had no idea what to expect. It seems that this series was being talked about everywhere and the second movie just came out. So I decided to see what the fuss was about. I absolutely love this series. The characters are so vivid. I could not wait to get to the next book.
Read this book shortly after watching the movie. Overall the movie did a great job, but reading the book gives you so much access to Katniss mind. The book is fast paced and relatively short. The story is very straightforward but it's always interesting. Its a great read.
Take "1984".  Take "The running man".  Take "Lord of the flies".  Add fast-paced action, first person present narration, remove some hope.  You'll get The Hunger Games. Can't wait to read more, although fearing an happy end that spoil the 1984 connection.
I found the lead up to the games very disturbing and intriguing. Once I got into the core of the story,I was consumed! Continually unnerved by  youth and innocence who were thrown into a fight for survival all in the name of entertainment, I could not put this book down!
This book kept me entertained from the beginning.  I wasn't sure what was going to happen. I am glad that the author is making another book b/c as I got nearer to the end it didn't look like there was enough pages to really resolve things.  I am anxiously awaiting the next book!
I didn't think I would like it, after all I hated the movie. I was given a new perspective though and find that not only did I have difficulty putting the book down, I am eager to begin the second one. I don't do reviews as a rule but felt it was necessary for this one.
WOW! please read this book and the following two. The three part series is so much more mature then the harry potter series, which makes its i believe a better book series. the author has really come up with an awesome idea which she has delivered on, unbelievable read!
I am 67 yrs old and this book and the trilogy was my best read in 40 years! The author is a master story teller and this is a creative masterpiece, sure to be a classic. War is hell, wouldn't is be wonderful if the world would depose of all dictators and live in peace.
I really enjoyed reading this. It was a real page turner and fun read.  I am a full grown adult reading this book so I had to keep in mind that the love story in it had to be a little.. unrealistic, I guess.  Overall its a great dystopian story involving young adults.
Don't hesitate to read the "Hunger Games" series....exciting and fast-moving! This series would make great movies.  The characters have a lot of dignity and have great human qualities.  Put in the element of survival and you have a great reading adventure ahead of you!
I couldn't put this book down.  Once I finished it I had to immediately start the second one.  The second one is even better. It keeps you in suspense.  Wanting to know more and more. I also immediately started the third one and I can't wait to find out what happens.
The Hunger Games is an easy read that is a unique idea.  I think Catniss is a good hero for young women.  It is kind of like a modern day, young adult version of 1984 in a way.  Good for the next generation to learn about the cautions of too powerful totalitarianism.
I found the book interesting for the first few pages, then it became quite boring. I only read about 50 pages before deleting it from my kindle. I'm really not sure what all the fuss is about. I think the book/film has a good publicity machine. Not good literature.
Having already seen the movie, I was not sure if I should read the book as well. But I am glad that I did. The book offers so much additional information about the characters and how they behave and why they do so.  Definitely worth a read for all fiction fans!
when I first started to read the series I was not sure I would like these book. I was so wrong once I finished the first book I had to buy the second and then the third. I hated to see it end. I feel so lost with out reading another book in the Hunger game series.
I enjoyed the book The Hunger Games.It was a page turner and would  extremely  recommend this book to a friend.Once you get to the part with the games there's no one who can stop you from not reading the rest of the book . I am definitely reading the other books.
I bought these books for my nine year old.  He loved this book so much that I decided to read it as well.  What happens in this book is unfathomable.  I think it helped give my son some perspective on how great a life he has.  I know it has made me more grateful.
Whew!!! this book is very interesting and intense at times. I LOVED the characters Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. The book reminds me of Bible time wars in the Colliseum. The battle is until someone dies. I am looking forward to the next book in the series.
This book is jam packed with action and emotions. It will have you mourning for people that don't even exists. You will be on the ends of your seats to find out what happens in this book. Caution not for the following, weak stomachs,faint of hearts and crybabies
I got this book because I watched the movie and really liked it. The book is so much better. You get a better sense of who Katniss is and why she does things. Also, I understood Peeta a lot better in the book than the movie. It's really good and I recommend it.
I borrowed this through Prime on a whim since I had just seen an ad for the movies and I have today that it is really fantastic. I couldn't put it down! Collins has a real talent for pacing and the social commentary is insightful as well. I highly recommend it.
Wow, I just finished the trilogy and sure wish there was more!  From clever and imaginative futuristic technology to the well developed characters, I thoroughly enjoyed the series.  I actually feel like I've made friends I'm now told I can't see anymore, darn!
I thought going into this book it would be a teenager's type novel. Surprisingly I read the first page and did not stop until the end! I'm not one of those pick apart a book person. I only know what is enjoyable to me , and this thoroughly was. On to book two!
I had already seen the movie but it was a while ago.  As per usual, the book develops characters so much better.  I felt like I really knew them an was experiencing what they were experiencing.  I can't wait for book 2!  I literally finished this one in a day!
I saw the movie before i read the book and I have to say the book blew me away. It really gave insight into Katniss' inner working and thought process. It made the book an amazing read that was hard to put down. If you are looking for a page turner this is it!
Loved reading this series.  Started with book 1 and couldn't stop reading until I was done with all 3.  Enjoyed the pace of this first book the best.  Left wondering many things, which I enjoyed.  Great book to read and compare to the movie that is coming out.
Engaging story.  Fast start.  This book is a readers dream.  I was mesmerized by it the whole way through.  The characters are interesting.  The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it ended too soon.  This is a must read if you like a good story.
It's obvious why everybody likes these books so much, the characters are beautifully described and very human, and they're put through an incredible ordeal.  It's about character in more ways than one - what would you do to save your family, your best friend?
This book is good and I'm about half way through now. It is very entertaining, but what I don't understand is how the author has yet to be sued. My favorite book of all time is Koushun Takami's "Battle Royale" This book follows a strangely similar plot line.
I can't believe I read this series and enjoyed it as much as I did.  It was a very good yet disturbing story line.  I would not recommend it for Tweens because of the violence and drama.  However, it's popularity speaks for itself with the teens and adults.
I love that these downloads are available - pretty much instantly!!  Was home sick in January &amp; needed a light read.  Within seconds it was downloaded and the story pulled me right in.  I read the book then watched the movie - of course the book was better!
Loved the whole series! Hope more great books are on the way! Major improvement on some YA books that are vapid and unrealistic. Katniss was a realistic character that reflected the normal confusion and issues expected to be dealt with in a difficult world.
It is a very good book. I picked it up every chance I could and read it in 5 days. I think it took me only 5 days because it is kinda short, in comparison to other books I've read. Had I known it would be such an easy read, I would have ordered the box set.
Absolutely loved this book!!! Suzanne Collins is a master story-teller. The character development is amazing, even for secondary characters such as Rue. At the end you feel like you know them all. I will be reading Catching Fire and Mockingjay immediately!
I love the Hunger Games. I thought it was going to be gory, because of children being killed, by its not. I borrowed from kindle library. I cannot wait until January, so I can borrow Catching Fire. This all came about because I went to see the Mockingjay.
If you liked the movie, this is going to fill the gaps and make of you a bigger fan. If you haven't seen te movies, well, this is a very entertaining story. The register is extremely easy to understand, both for English speakers and non-English speakers.
I didn't plan on reading a trilogy...  but this was that good. Yep, that good.  I immediately got the trilogy for myself, my fiance, and a friend...  who've all read it now and loved it!  Great story...sorry, no spoilers here.
I liked the attention given to Katniss. It's her story after all. I didn't like the glossing over of any other character. Peeta deserved more. The premise is interesting, the pacing was great. Enjoyed reading it and look forward to the rest of the story.
I often do not give in to "fad books", i.e. the Twilight Series, 50 Shades of Gray, but my mom recommended this book and I caved.  I am so glad I did!  I could not put this book down once I started, and never once was I bored reading it.  Excellent read!
This  book was unbelievable. I saw the movie before I read this, and  I think the movie is definitely missing some very important key features. For example, when thresh saved katniss for dying for rue. All in all, this book had me speechless throughout.
Loved this book but the ending made me mad lol.  Peeta should have know that katniss had to fake some of her feelings for the cameras, they didn't really know each other and how do you fall in love with someone while there s always cameras watching?
I'm used to reading books targeted for an older crowd and thought this one might be "too young" for my taste, but it proved me wrong. I couldn't stop reading once I started. I'm purchasing the second one through Kindle right now. Fantastic read!
Love these books!!! I can't even begin to tell you how awesome this book is. The tension, suspense, characters, action, plot...everything is so amazing. Suzanne Collins a great writer. Word of Caution: DO read the book before seeing the movie...just saying..
Don't know why I waited until all of my grandchildren read it to read it myself.  They loved it and I loved it.  Very thought provoking book. It is not just a very good adventure story but it also encourages you to think about World Order and politics.
I initially wasn't too interested in even reading this book!! Once I started it, I totally couldn't put it down. I read it in three days and now I can't wait to start the next one!! Now I HAVE to see the movie. So glad my husband recommended I read it.
Love this book!  This first installment is exciting and enchanting, making you fall headfirst into the world of Panem and in love with the characters.  After reading this I was dying for the next two to come out on Kindle and cheered when they arrived!
A little dark for a young adult novel, but I read each book in a day or two because you literally can't put it down. A dynamic page-turner that is a metaphor for our times, when the rich get richer and the poor decide to finally do something about it.
This book had me crying, laughing, angry, sad, and practically every other emotion. I couldn't put it down! I confirmed over it really badly and will for a long time to come. I'm extremely glad I read this book and recommend it to anyone and everyone.
Once I started this book I could not put it down. Then, when I finished it, I needed to read the second one right away....and then the third. It became my obsession for a while. Exciting, addictive and an "on the edge of your seat type story".
I like this book because it goes straight into the games unlike the second book.  Other then "the hunger games" I could go without reading. But because I couldnt put the book down! I have to give it five stars.  One of my favorite books by far
Devoured couldn't put down and had to tell everybody about this series. This world sucks you in and you find yourself lost in the passion and emotions of the characters. It's been over 2 yrs since I've read it and I still think about it all the time.
The Hunger Games is a riveting novel about a new world. It is ruled by the Capitol. Every other place, called a district, is forced to send a girl and boy to fight each other to the death. It is an amazingly descriptive story that I highly recommend.
Yes, I sure waited long enough to get around to reading this...  I wasn't interested in reading this book or its sequels when it first came out, and so I was left wondering what all the fuss was about when it became popular and gained a movie adaptation, fan following, and even a few parodies.  I even watched the movie adaptation of "Catching Fire," though I was left horribly confused given that I hadn't read any of the books or seen the first movie beforehand.  So I figured it was inevitable that I'd need to read the series for myself, and after friends and family members recommended the series to me I finally gave in and set about to reading the trilogy.  The verdict?  While not a masterpiece or the best series I've ever read, "The Hunger Games" is an enjoyable, fast-paced book, and I'm eager to complete the sequels.  The world of "The Hunger Games" is Panem, a nation built from the ruins of the North American continent after a series of unspecified disasters has obliterated society as we know it.  Panem is made up of twelve districts (formerly thirteen before a disastrous revolution destroyed District 13 and subjugated the rest) that lay under the tyrannical rule of the decadent Capitol, and the titular Hunger Games are part of their ongoing schemes to further quell the districts.  Every year on the "reaping," each district must send a boy and a girl to compete in the Games, where all the children and teens must hunt one another until only one is left standing.  When young poacher Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her sister's place in the Games, she knows she's going to her death, but is determined to do all she can to last as long in the Games as possible.  But as the deadly Games progress, opponents die, alliances are forged, and truths revealed, Katniss realizes that it's possible that she can survive and win... but will the cost be worth it?  The writing style of this book isn't exactly special -- it's competent, and does a good job of drawing us into the action and moving events along at a swift but not breakneck pace.  And Collins has built a world that makes logical sense, a world that draws on the Empire of ancient Rome, classic dystopian stories, and perhaps most frighteningly our own age of the ignorant excess and decadence of the upper classes and the tawdry entertainment of reality television.  Perhaps the story isn't terribly original -- "Battle Royale" is often cited as a source of plagiarism, though there are also shades of "Brave New World," "1984," and "The Most Dangerous Game" -- but it's told entertainingly, and the Games, with their glamorous and entertaining surface concealing the ugly reality, are a fascinating aspect of the futuristic culture.  Collins does a decent job with the characters as well, for the most part.  Katniss feels like a realistic heroine, one who has suffered loss and hardship as a citizen of the districts and is grimly determined to do what's necessary to survive even as she struggles to adapt to the life of ease and glamour that is the Capitol.  The supporting cast is made up of plenty of colorful characters, and I found myself enjoying many of them -- the cantankerous and liquor-loving former champion Haymitch, the brainless but efficient Effie Trinket, the calmly dignified fashionista Cinna, and the tiny but resourceful champion of District 11 Rue.  (I ended up liking that last character enough that I sort of wish SHE had won the Games...)  Of course, as is pretty much a prerequisite of YA novels anymore, Katniss is caught up in a love triangle -- her best friend Gale at home, and her fellow District 12 tribute Peeta.  Both boys are curiously bland, without much to give them characterization save their relationship with Katniss.  I wonder if future books will give them more in the way of actual personality, though that should have been established in this book.  One other problem I have with this book is the muttations (that's not a typo) -- hybrid animals created by the government for war purposes or to inflict on the players in the Games.  While I'm not against using these creatures in fiction (even if muttations is a rather stupid name), and actually liked the jabberjays, mockingjays, and tracker jackers, it was the final beast released in the arena that was ridiculous enough to jar me out of the story.  I won't spoil further, but it felt like a weird inclusion that shook me out of the world of the book and made me go "okay, that's stupid."  When I have this moment while reading a book, I know something's wrong with what I'm reading...  While not a masterpiece, "The Hunger Games" is a fun read, and if you're not yet burned out on the genre of YA dystopia, give it a try.  It's an exciting ride all the way through, and I'm diving right into the sequel.
Hunger Games - An Analysis   Power, Control and Forbidden Love are the central themes of the Dystopian Novel "Hunger Games".  Suzanne Collins has a unique style to 'grab' the audience's attention by drawing them in to her view of 'dystopian society'.   Dystopian societies are fictionalized versions of the author's view of futuristic societies when compared to societies as they exist today.  There is a great deal of interest in how societies will be in the future,  as witnessed by the incredible interest in the October 21, 2015 societal predictions found within the "Back To The Future" film of 1985, which predicted among other things, flying cars and hover boards.  There were many news stories comparing the presentation of '2015' society as imagined in 1985 to what actually exists in the 'real' 2015.  One of the most interesting being whether the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series.  Ironically, they came closer than they had been in years, making it to the playoffs this year.   The main target of these novels seems to be 'young adults' and studies have shown that recently 'millennials' are very dissatisfied with the 'status quo' economically and politically.  Younger teens aged 13 and older may also be attracted to this type of novel.  The reader may be attracted by a sense of curiosity and uncertainty about the future.  It's natural to want to have an optimistic view of our future.  No one wants to face a 'bleak' tomorrow.   The 'rules' of the games do not discriminate between the race of the opponents.  Each 'district' is represented by two people, one male and one female, aged 12-18 who fight to the death.  Each 'district' represents one 'industry' such as farming or coal mining.   The 'Capital' is wealthy,  while those living in the 'Districts' are impoverished due to their loss of an essential 'Civil War' where the "Districts' lost.  The people in the Capital are in 'control' of the games and convince the Districts that they have no choice but to participate.  Whether acknowledged or not, this is quintessential  socialism, while promising some aspect of 'equality', any dissent is met with oppression, while only those in control of the means of production, which has been 'Nationalized'  become wealthy and in control.   One doesn't have to 'imagine' this 'reality', it exists in Russia, North Korea and a dozen other different  modern day societies.  Slavery, which America fought a civil war to abolish, still exists throughout the world.  Women's rights including the right to vote, are still only a dream in oppressive societies, such as within the Middle East where women can't drive, let alone vote.  Same Sex marriage, recently affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, brings only discrimination in Russia and a death sentence in Saudi Arabia and Iran.   The 'Capital' convinces each District that the 'Hunger Games' are acceptable and 'exciting'.  The 'Capital' controls the means of production, access to resources and even nutrition, using fear, oppression and depression to control the 'weak' within the 'district' through force versus consent.   The old adage that "Ignorance of the past can cause you to repeat those mistakes"  is clearly on display, as the mistakes so clearly demonstrated by oppressive, totalitarian, socialistic/communistic societies are served up in these 'futuristic' interpretations of  so many 'Dystopian Societies'.
Well-written, well-paced, enjoyable, a page turner. Any book that I want to pick up and continue with is on to a good thing. I enjoyed the story, characters and twists.  I wasn't so keen on the use of the present tense - I'm so used to reading novels in past tense that this regularly grated. I was also a bit surprised at a few errors, considering the book will have been edited so many times and made so much money - publishers cutting back on polishing books? For example "I know one has found me and the others will be honing in". Should be "homing in" (though it is a common error). There's also some badly-planned sections that come across as unconvincing placeholders. For example, Katniss decides she wants to hunt alone because Peeta is noisy, then come back for him, but doesn't think he'll agree. She hasn't said anything about it aloud but immediately he states that's what she should do, for those reasons. It's the kind of thing an author writes because they have an omniscient view, but later editing should remove the too-obvious god hand.  I should also go and fuss the big grey thing stood in the corner. When I started reading The Hunger Games I knew little about it, having avoided mentions and spoilers and films. I just had a vague  thought that it was popular and was dystopian sci-fi, maybe like 1984  I switched off whenever Hunger Games was mentioned online to avoid knowing more. As such I was surprised as I read it that it seemed so familiar  and immediately connected it with Battle Royale. I kept thinking Wow, thats similar, surely it cant be an accident? Suzanne Collins says she never read Battle Royale or knew of it as she was writing Hunger Games. I can accept that, though it still seems strange to me. I knew about Battle Royale years before Suzanne Collins wrote Hunger Games. Battle Royale was widely talked about and praised - I bought it from a Waterstones display. It wasn't something obscure. Then they made a film of it and it became even more well-known due to the controversial violence. Still, this has been discussed elsewhere, I just wanted to mention it as someone who knew nothing of the controversy or what Hunger Games was about, but the resemblances immediately struck me  children forced to kill each other as a punitive lesson by a controlling, hi-tech Government; an arena with randomised weapons, areas altered to force victims together; a hero finding a way to outwit the controllers; technology to track and observe the children and so on.  As an editor I always critique things, but don't focus on that as my full view - my overall perception of the book is very positive, and I look forward to reading the sequels.
So I was suppose to have my review of this book up on Sunday when I finished it, but I have been super busy so I guess better late than never.  I don't know why I waited so long to read this book. I have seen the movie but I have to say the book is better. I got to really feel and understand Katniss in this story and I have to say she is a survivor through and through.  Katniss and her family live in District 12 where it is a poor district the main job there is to be a coal miner. You can tell Katniss is a different than those in the district she really tries to take care of her mother and little sister Prim. When her sister gets picked to be part of the annual Reaping which there is no way out of Katniss steps up. It is something that hasn't seemed to happen before so of course you know it is going to be good. We read on as Katniss and the bakers son who is madly in love with her even though she doesn't know it as of yet train, eat good food, learn what the capital likes and doesn't like.  When the games begin who will be left to survive as there can be only one winner or can there be?  The character development was perfect to me on this book. You really got a feel for all the characters not just the main ones. I think one thing that got me with Katniss is  how she seemed to stick it to the capital when she could and it wasn't in your face type of thing but subtle. There is plenty of action though out the story that leaves you turning the pages as fast as you can read it. For me it was hard to imagine that these characters were between the ages of 12 and 18 I guess being in a situation where it is life or death makes you seem more grown up than you really are. I can not wait to jump into book two and then book three. If you haven't read The Hunger Games book one I highly suggest you do. #PaperbackFriday
If you're looking for a gritty, brutal YA SciFi-Fantasy-Adventure novel, Hunger Games fits the bill. There have been over 20,000 reviews written for the book and over 12,000 for the movie, so what can I say that hasn't already been said? I'll say something about the main allegory the story represents.  Hunger Games is a Dystopian fantasy featuring a society that is very advanced scientifically and technically. In this world there is no reason that anyone has to struggle for a living or go hungry, and yet most of the people are barely getting by on a sustenance level. We are told that this world, called Panem, is a post-apocalyptic Earth. Apparently they were able to hold civilization together, because we are also told that District 13 rebelled against the post-apocalyptic order, for which they were destroyed, and in order to discourage further rebellion the Capitol keeps the remaining twelve districts on a primitive sustenance level, relatively powerless, and if that's not enough to keep a lid on things they hold an annual Hunger Games to remind everyone of just how powerless they are and how brutal the Capitol can be.  So what is the crude and clumsy allegory? Panem is supposed to represent a military dictatorship, such as North Korea, and that's fine as far as it goes, but the problem is that Panem is far more advanced than North Korea, or any nation on Earth. This novel seems to forget why military dictatorships exist. For the sake of brevity, I'll oversimplify: Military dictatorships exist because of scarce resources. Even in advanced democratic nations, such as the US, most of our problems exist because of scarce resources. In a world like Panem, the problem of scarce resources has been solved. I concede that humans can be irrational, but I find it implausible that a society reaching the state of development evident in this story would reduce itself to a military dictatorship, because those in power would lose so much more than they could possibly gain. Contrary to popular belief, it's just not that much fun to be a dictator when it's not based on scarce resources.  Sure, people desire power, sometimes madly. I'm reminded of the Kipling novel, also a movie, "The Man Who Would Be King," and Milton's "Paradise Lost" in which Lucifer exclaims "It is better to rule in Hell than serve in Heaven." But individuals are one thing and entire societies are another. Individuals are more susceptible to being driven by personal flaws, but large, complex, advanced societies are largely driven by scarce resources. It's been said that the US will go to war for oil but not for broccoli. In Hunger Games the Capitol is at war with the entire world over nothing, and I just can't buy that premise - it's just too cynical for my taste and it's based on a flawed perspective on human behavior.  That being said, I understand how this major flaw is necessary for the plot. All sorts of exciting things can happen in this story thanks to the advanced technology of the Capitol. With all the action, most people (I suspect) aren't going to notice or care about the gaping logical inconsistencies implied by such a society. But I noticed, and now that I've pointed it out I'm curious to know what some of you think. If you think that such a society is plausible, what evidence can you provide to support that view? If we solve the problem of scarce resources, how is any dictatorship desirable, possible or sustainable?
1. I bought a book on amazon about three months ago the quality of the book than almost all the rest of what I've read for a long time already. Basically it consists of a post-apocalyptic future, in which a "Capitol" dominates America. (USA no longer exists.) To control the 12 districts of the country of Panem, the Capitol makes them send (to force) 12 boys and 12 girls to a mini-Colosseum to fight each other. These young gladiators are participants in The Hunger Games.  A past of wars has left the 12 districts that divide Panem under the tyrannical power of the "Capitol". Without freedom and poverty, no one can leave the confines of his district. Only a 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, dares to challenge the rules for getting food. The principals will be tested with "The Hunger Games" televised spectacle that organizes Capitol Hill to humiliate the population. Each year, 2 representatives from each district will be required to survive in a hostile environment and fight to the death between them until a single survivor. When her little sister is chosen to participate, Katniss no doubt take its place, determined to demonstrate its firm and resolute attitude, that even in the most desperate situations is place for love and respect.  This first book in the trilogy is an excellent introduction to the world of taxes and panem in general. It's an interesting idea and very well told which presents Suzanne Collins; a world that at certain points could be compared with ours, which is taken to extremes by use of the "games" that only serve to remind people that have control over them panem government. It is written in first person, allowing us to unite more Katniss; understand their actions, their thoughts, accept the decisions you can make in the course of the games to stay alive and to some extent it can get to become; so personally, it made me part of the story at a higher level.
Every year in the country of Panem, an annual show called The Hunger Games is aired on T.V. This isn't your usual television show. Children between the ages of 12-18 are chosen as sacrifices to fight to the death. Yes, people do enjoy watching this. Only if you live in the Capitol. The Capitol is this place where the president of Panem lives. The president of Panem is President Snow. There are 12 districts in Panem. All the districts must give up a boy and girl for the fight, unless you live in the Capitol. The citizens of the Capitol love the show. They eagerly await for it to be that time of the year again. They enjoy watching the fight and they like to pick favorites and place bets.  We follow Katniss Everdeen, who is 16 years old. She lives in the Seam in district 12. She lives at home with her younger sister, Prim, and her mother. Her father died in a coal mining explosion. On the day of the reaping (the day that the tributes are chosen), Katniss goes out for a little hunt in the woods with her best friend Gale. Katniss and Gale hunt in the woods for food. This is illegal. What else is there to do when you're poor and you don't have food?  After their little snack, they head over to the reaping. At the reaping, Effie Trinket chooses a "winner". District 12 usually never wins. There have only been 2 winners in district 12, one of which is still alive. The living winner's name is Haymitch. He is usually always drunk.  The first name that Effie pulls out of the girl's bowl is none other than Katniss' little sister, Prim. Prim begins to walk up to the stage when suddenly Katniss takes her place. This is unusual, especially for district 12. Why would you sacrifice yourself?  Effie then pulls out a boy's name. She pulls out a slip with the name "Peeta Mellark" on it. Katniss doesn't like this. Peeta and Katniss have a past together, and she feels that she can't kill him after what he did for her. Throughout the rest of the novel, we follow Katniss and Peeta as they try to survive in the arena while other people are out to get them.  This book was amazing! It was everything that I love in a book. Amazing characters that you can easily connect to, adventure, and a little bit of romance on the side. I do enjoy how the romance wasn't the main point of the story. It was fast-paced and it was definitely a page-turner. Once you start this book, you don't want to put it down. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. Days after I finished the book, I was still thinking about it. There is also a huge cliffhanger that makes you want the next book immediately. I definitely suggest that everyone read it!
The Hunger Games.  Where do I even begin?  This book was so amazing I couldn't put it down!  I finished this book within 24 hours, which is like a record for me.  I will say that the first few chapters are a bit slow, but in hindsight they are necessary so stick with it.  Trust me, after you get past those first few chapters you will not be able to stop.  Your nose will indeed be stuck in this book everywhere you go.  You will not be able to get enough of it.  Okay, let's get serious for a bit.  I have heard a lot of crap said of "The Hunger Games."  Some people tend to focus on the fact that there are kids killing kids.  Yes, there are.  BUT, that is not the main or whole picture of this story.  It is not just a brutal tale of children being forced to fight to the death in some arena.  There is SO SO SO much more.  The people of The Hunger Games are ruled by a greedy, self-serving government.  They want full control of the Districts, basically keeping them as slaves.  One District acted out against The Capital years ago and was destroyed.  As a punishment for their actions, and to insure none of the other Districts tried the same thing, The Capital decided to make an example every year as a reminder.  (They also make it out to seem it is for the Districts' own protection.)  So, they choose one male and one female from each District every year.  They are thrown into an arena and must fight to the death with only one person surviving.  Katniss (and Peta) is thrown into this arena but instead of acting like this is normal, or good even, she stands against it.  She lets it be known that what The Capital is doing is wrong.  She decides to fight her oppressors and soon starts a revolution.  So, it isn't about kids killing kids.  It is about a these people living in a bad world, under a cruel leader and being forced into a horrid situation.  Katniss does what is necessary to live, but she does not take the killing lightly.  She lets it be know the wrong being down and fights to change it.  I have also heard some claim Suzanne Collins to be a horrible person for being able to write something so cruel.  I do not find this to be the case, for all the same reasons I do not think the storyline is simply about kids killing kids.  I'd like to not that a lot of writers base their stories on things they have read, witnessed, or experienced themselves.  I could easily see some of her inspiration for this coming from something like the holocaust.  Of course, I do not know this for certain, I am only giving an example to explain what I mean.  Bottom line.  Read the book for yourself.  Do not form your opinion of it from others.  Everyone's opinions are different and only you can decide what you like.
The Hunger Games trilogy is currently one of the most famous book and movie series amongst readers and moviegoers of all ages. I would be very surprised if anyone in America hasnt heard of the series. The Hunger Games trilogy is personally my favorite book and movie series. The vast amount of action and adventure mixed with drama and emotion is astounding. The novel is so incredibly interesting that I could not put it down. The dystopian society Suzanne Collins creates is simply amazing. The plot of the novel is that adolescents have to battle to the death in order for the government to maintain control over citizens is just absolutely outrageous, which is probably one of the largest allurements to the novel.  The basic premise of the first novel is that two adolescents from each of the twelve districts are chosen at random to fight to the death in the hunger games for all to watch on television. Somehow this act of violence keeps the districts in check for the government to have total control. The first work in the series opens on Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist, in the squalor that is her home in district 12. Collins sets the novel by explaining the relationship Katniss has to each of her family members. The way Katniss must care for her own mother and sister shows the depth of her love for her family. Collinss use of imagery lets the reader take an in depth look into the desolation of district 12. It is a cold, dirty place, yet Katniss still manages to find her contentment, which happens to be outside the walls in the woods where she can hunt. During the reaping, Primrose is selected to enter the games, but Katniss, knowing her twelve year old sister would have a great chance of dying, so instead Katniss chooses to volunteer in her place. The male tribute is Peeta Melark. Citizens are allowed to pay the capitol to send aids into the arena to help the tributes survive. Therefore, in order to drum up some interest, the two tributes pretend to be star-crossed lovers who must now fight each other to the death.  Later in the novel Katniss befriends a little girl named Rue. Katniss and Rue stick together for a while trying to keep each other alive. The two plan to take lead an elite group of killer tributes away from them, but Rue is killed in the process. Katniss immediately takes action by killing Rues murderer. Katniss then lays Rue to rest by singing to her and by placing flowers all around her as a tribute to her memory. Later in the games Katniss plays her part in showing affection towards Peeta and they even make it all the way to the end of the games. Katniss with her amazing accuracy with the bow and arrow and Peetas genius idea of camouflage help the two to the end. They have done the impossible by surviving the brutal warfare and now they must fight each other, but they have other ideas about that. Katniss and Peeta stuff a hand full of poison berries into their mouths and right before they can bite down, there is an announcement that they have both won the games. Katniss defies the government by not going along with their plans and almost killing herself and Peeta. Katniss does not know it, but through her actions she has started the revolution.
*Warning: This review may contain spoilers. Read at your own risk.  Review courtesy of The Tattered Page:  Before I start my rant about The Hunger Games, I have to admit that I was reluctant to read it -- as you can see I waited until now to do so. And to be honest, I cannot give you a good reason why. Perhaps it was a number of things that prevented me from reading the book. Maybe I was afraid the book would let me down since the film was so good? or maybe I was afraid that the film strayed to far from the novel and I would be pissed?  Well, that does not matter now. I finally give in and read The Hunger Games. And loved it!  The characters were real and came off the pages. Katniss, the girl on fire, and Peeta, the boy with the bread = . The pace off the story was steady. There was just the right balance of thrill, unrequited love humor (yes!) and relative material. I mean, I fell into the story. I felt a part of it. The whole while I was reading The Hunger Games, I felt as if I were beside Katniss. Absolutely mind-altering work of literature that gets under your skin.  "Without thinking, I pull an arrow from my quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers' table. I hear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. the arrow skewers the apple in the pigs' mouth and pins it to the wall behind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief.  'Thank you for your consideration,' I say. then I give a slight bow and walk straight toward he exit without being dismissed" [page 102].  What I found most interesting, was how Katniss always assume she would be the one to kill Peeta during the games, although she never outright stated or even admitted it (Pages 33, 72, etc.). Yet, in the end, Katniss was the one to save Peeta.  But let us get back to Peeta Mellark. Oh, Peeta, Peeta, Peeta. He is such a sweetheart but not to the point of weakness. Maybe that is why I love his character?  Not to mention, how much better does it get then when you find out the cute, kind boy with the beard secretly pined Katniss since they were 5 years old! Can I get a "book boyfriend material!"? Amen.  "'And right when your song ended, I knew -- just like your mother -- I was a goner,' Peeta says. 'Then for the next eleven years, I tried to work up the nerve to talk to you'" [pages 300-301].  Now, I am patiently (sike!) waiting for my copies of Catching Fire and Mockingjay to arrive in the mail. Cannot wait to read them -- although I think I am going to wait to read Mockingjay after the movies since that will be the case for the first two books in the trilogy.  Happy Reading!

Imagine a future America where a central government rules all with an iron fist, fed by the tribute of 12 subjugated colonies. Those in the capital city live lives of ease, abundance and entertainment at the expense of the colonists, who struggle against nature every day to survive. This is the life of the teenage Katniss, a girl who risks punishment for excursions beyond the electric fence to find food for her widowed mother and young sister.  Her slow trudge toward a bleak future is suddenly interrupted when her sister's name is drawn to compete in the annual Hunger Games, and Katniss volunteers in her sibling's place. The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. Twenty-four teens from the 12 colonies are chosen to fight to the death in an arena of diabolical design, their every word and action televised to a riveted nation. Because the colony of the winning contestant receives extra food allotments for an entire year, the full attention of the colonies focuses on the outcome.  The story follows Katniss through her preparation and competition. Although she wishes only to survive, Katniss' ingenuity, selflessness, and defiance soon earn the admiration of viewers across the nation. She slowly becomes that which the Capital fears the most: a symbol of rebellious hope to the oppressed colonies. Even if she survives the games, she may not survive the wrath of the central government.  Much has been said about the Hunger Games trilogy - that it is a knock-off of previous works, that it is simplistic in its view of humanity, that it is little more than a moral parable. The critics, however, have missed the bigger picture. Ms. Collins has painted a portrait of an America not far removed from our own - one where the oppression of race has been replaced by the oppression of class, and where the divide between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' has grown deep. She achieves what every author should - to have the reader care deeply for the main character, and to have the reader think deeply about the circumstances and actions of that character. This novel is a tremendous mixture of action and relationships, and should not be missed by any teen reader.
After being disturbed by the violence in the first movie, I waited a long time before reading this book.  And I only read it because of all the hype around it (I like to see what all the fuss is about).  Despite my trepidation over the movie, I found this to be a very good read...and that is saying something for a book about a dystopian society.  I feel Suzanne Collins fictional world, Panem, could easily be compared to any of the classics of a like genre (e.g. A Brave New World, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Animal Farm, The Giver, and even Lord of the Flies).  There is still the unusual violence in the book that is disturbing, and possibly even more disturbing is the reaction to the booki.e. readers and movie viewers saying things like It is awesome!  Respectfully, there is nothing awesome about a little kid getting killed in an arena.  A reaction of this sorts puts the reader in league with the evil Capitol in this bookentertained by violence.  A book about a dystopian society should evoke warning and perhaps even rage at the injustice, but not excitement.  And yet, the source of the problem is that Suzanne Collins writes in such a way that the books ARE quite entertaining.  Her staccato style of writing lends itself well to action, and action is the strength of her book (along with her development of an environment of oppression).  Violent death is expected and accepted in The Hunger Games, but its done so in arena of entertainment.  This arena is horrifyingly entertaining to her fictional Capitol viewers, but also, the reader of the book cannot help but be captivated by it.  You simply dont have time to come up for breath because you have to know how it ends.  That is quite an achievement.  One knock on this style of writing is that she rarely stops to savor good moments.  Some conversations that could be cherished more fully are cut short by this clipped tone in the book.  Its almost as if the story were a race and there is no time to stop, not even for important moments, and that very well might be what Collins has in mind.  Experiencing the story in first person present, the reader walks through the world of Panem inside of Katniss head AS events playout.  Good moments are so fleeting in Katniss Everdeens life that it is very realistic to cut short these good momentsbut realism is bought at the expense of the reader being able to cherish those good moments.  While I wont call it awesome (in the name of decency), it is a very good read, not only keeping the reader glued to the pages, but also serving as a poignant reminder that sometimes oppression must be faced, and sometimes there are things worth dying for.
I read this book mainly because I'm in a kick of reading teen lit these days (the Earthsea books, the Tripods series, and the Giver Quartet), and also because my 13-year-old wanted to read it or see the movie so badly that I though tI should preview the material for age-appropriateness.  As such, the book isn't as gruesome as I feared (hello, Battle Royale), and there's plenty of humanity in the characters, sometimes in very surprising ways - after all, who would think that someone with a nickname like Foxface would actually become a highly endearing character? As for the violence, that's also toned down as there are a lot of off-screen or non-murder killings so that we really only experience a few, far less than the maximum of 22 that we could have endured. I've okayed it for my 13-year-old, who is generally less squeamish than other kids these days, and I'm looking forward to reading the next books.  What surprised me as an adult reader was how well-written the book is, and how fully Collins develops the characters as mature individuals. A whole gamut of cliches were expected, but I found myself getting into this very compelling tale with delicious plot twists. If only writers like George RR Martin could learn from someone like Collins, who is not only a gifted storyteller, but who probably has a great editor too.  Unfortunately, and it may be a bit of a spoiler to talk about this, I can see the next books being set up to deal more with relationship issues and emotional insecurity (does he love me, or not? do I love him or not? I I don't know... it's all so confusing!!); I highly doubt that the next two books will be as interesting as this one is, but let's see. Collins has come through and surprised me before - I was initially a bit prejudiced against the book, given that the ideas are so clearly lifted from other tales like Battle Royale, Logan's Run, The Running Man, Death Race 2000, even The Giver), but this book has a great spin on things and I'm happy to give it five stars, and to recommend it to other readers
It is probably written originally for teenager readers, because of the age of its main characters, but considering its content and many gory details it is more suited for adult readers. I have read several books of a dire future of mankind, based on the BIG BROTHER dictatorships, which control everything, written by such great writers as George Orwell (1984), Aldous Huxley (Brave new world) and Ira Levin (This perfect day) and although this book has a similar topic, it has a substantially different approach. The world is divided into a central, dominating, Capitol, where people live in abundance and comfort, and 12 districts, where the inhabitants live in poverty, totally controlled by the Capitol and in fear of heavy punishments for any transgression. Each district is specialized in one kind of production. District 12 is the worst, the only jobs are in coal mining, a very heavy work, with a short life expectancy. Each year 2 young people per district are extracted by a lottery number to represent it in a terrible game, transmitted by TV to all districts and for the entertainment of the elite living in the Capitol. The game is a struggle till death, where only one of the 24 unlucky chosen survives. Most part of the book is the description of this terrible persecution of each one against the other 23, viewed by a District 12 contestant of this deadly game, where some temporary alliances are woven. It is better not to divulge the winner, in order not to reveal for possible readers the most interesting end result. In my KIndle version the first three chapters of the sequel of this novel are included, (there exist three consecutive novels) certainly in order to awaken the interest of the readers in the future fate of the protagonists, a clever selling trick of the following book.
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live poor and barely have enough money to put food on the table? If you want to learn what it feels like and more, read this book. This book is about a headstrong, 16 year old girl who lives in a place called the 12th District. Her name is Katniss Everdeen. This district is very poor, like most of the others.  She feeds her mom and sister, Prim, by illegally hunting in the woods outside their district. In this way, she becomes a very good archer.  There is an annual event called the Hunger Games, which is a televised reality show. From each District, one female and one male is sent to participate in the Hunger Games. In this event all of the selected kids must fight to the death for the Capitol's amusement. The Capitol is the capitol of the districts. The citizens of the Capitol are rich, shallow, selfish people who are more obsessed with their beauty than the thousands dying of starvation in the districts. Prim is chosen to take place in the games and Katniss volunteers to go in her place. The male who is chosen for District 12 is Peeta, a shy 15 year old boy who loves Katniss. Katniss manages to survive three weeks in the arena. Read the book to find out how.   I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and to be on the edge the whole time while reading a well written book. The message of the story is that if you have lots of money and never have to work hard for anything, you are less likely to care about people, and forget the truly important things in life. On the other hand, when you don't have much and you must sacrifice for others it can make you a better person. Thank you for reading my essay and I hope you enjoy reading this book.
As we grow and old in this civilization we pick up few things. Some of us do at least. For instance, sooner or later we learn not to take any heed to what PR-guys are saying. After all, what kind of marketing would that be if it were to say things like: We suck, dont buy our product. Unfortunately, though we may know things like that only saints stay vigilant all the time. So, when some PR-guy, on account of publishing firm, screams something along the lines of: Look, we have new Twilight coming out. Pay attention. Buy! we tend to say  pfft!  and go on with our businesses. Seriously, who in their right mind would want to read another Twilight? When The Hunger Games came out, official PR did exactly that. Since I couldnt escape that hype back then, I did what looked relatively sane at the time. Totally ignored both Collins and her book. Couple of years later, I remembered the lesson I should have known all this time. Never trust PR. The Hunger Games, apart from female lead character, has nothing in common with Twilight. The Hunger Games is, actually, a very good book. It isnt the best of what that elusive genre of YA can offer, but its far from the worst.   At this point Im inclined to go at length about movie adaptation with Jennifer Lawrence (there is a lot of interesting tidbits to talk about here, especially if you take note of what is omitted in the movies), but saner part of me keeps saying no so I must concur. After all, movie-verse is (and should be) different from the book-verse. Thats another thing LoTR fans will never understand. Lets focus on the text instead. Suzanne Collins writes compelling narrative about a young girl forced to fight for her own life and survival. Taken on its own, the topic itself is nothing to write home about. Weve seen it countless times, especially in genre-writing and if we would compare The Hunger Games with other prolific titles or authors which write about similar things, Collins would stay far behind. Her world-building is much too weak, her treatment of politics is naïve at best and too many parts of the book behave like a script instead of a novel (which makes sense considering that Collins made her career in television before she managed to pull a global hit). What is to write home about, especially if youre, I dont know, sixteen and still couldnt possibly have read all these things old farts like me tend to glorify, is Collins treatment of Katniss, fluidity of narration, careful avoidance of any sort of teenage-melodrama or love-pathos and skillful, logical and sensible i.e. gradual change of Katniss from life-hardened pragmatic to something resembling engaged political citizen.    The Hunger Games, PR will tell you, promise some sort of blood and gore spectacle in a dystopian futuristic society filled with drama and boys kissing girls. On the other hand, Collins writes about everything but. Sure, there is blood and there is gore (much more than in movies which have to play it carefully to keep PG-13 rating), there is even some kissing. But there are far more important things as well, talked about with appealing cynical pragmatism from which you can learn few things about ways of the world. In other words The Hunger Games offer what every good YA literature should -  (relatively) interesting premise, intelligent structure, logical and compelling storytelling, something resembling political realism and relatable, humane characters which are in no way perfect yet they strive to be, as we all do. The Hunger Games is a nice introduction to more serious writing about dystopias and if it does its job (and somehow I think it will, or that it already did), some of the fans of the series will migrate to other things and will stay forever entranced with this analogue magic of literature. Thats a win for itself right there. We shouldnt take these things lightly.
Most people will know the story by now; I had seen the film first, which may have lessened the tension of the book.  Any reader is going to be distressed by the situation; each district of a separated nation - a future America - has got to produce two young people as tributes each year. These two are put in an arena covering a large area with the other tributes and expected to fight to the death. The winner is rich and famous; their district is prosperous that year.  When most districts are poor this is a sure way to divide the population's allegiances and keep the central rulers in the capital safe from rebellion.  Katniss, our guide, is a young woman used to hunting in the woods, as her coal-miner father was killed in a mine accident and his family was likely to starve.  She volunteers in the place of her little sister who is chosen as a tribute. We then follow her and the baker's son as they face cameras, travel to the capital, meet the drunk, worn-out survivor of a previous Hunger Game who is their best support.  The games are as expected brutal and miserable as exposure and starvation will kill the tributes if they hide too well in the woods, while the rulers find ways to force them together to get some action. Already unusual, Katniss becomes a rebel. The film showed outside effects of her actions, but cutting away during the book would have been wrong, so we do not see what is happening outside the arena, just learn the tributes' best guess.  I did find that the idea of twelve-year-olds being expected to compete against eighteen-year-olds was unlikely.  The first-person present tense narrative has been written extremely well and reads easily. Background fill-in comes smoothly and no more than is needed; Katniss is not an overly learned person nor a dull one. She has known little love and never expected to do more than survive, making her oddly prepared for the event. While the trend in YA books is depressing at present, with dystopian tales and overall distrust of adults and society, I believe that The Hunger Games says something important about entertainment and welfare. The tense and information-filled tale has been well realised, making an addictive read.
Decided to read this because a friend who was lukewarm on the book still wanted to see the movie, and I hate seeing movies I haven't read the book of. Plus it's nice to see what the hype is about and have my own opinion.  I didn't like the writing as much as I liked some of the concepts. What's with all the comma splices? It's just a little clumsy sometimes, but not often enough that you get used to it and adapt, so when something's weird or wrong it really sticks out. Katniss's narration talked to the faceless audience a lot, especially in the beginning, to explain stuff to us, and I was wondering who she was talking to. Sometimes it was okay because it bounced right off of what she was thinking or doing. Other times it was a history/culture lesson and that I didn't like, but I dealt with it. And there were a lot of flashbacks, which sometimes worked well and sometimes felt shoehorned in. Beyond that, the actual writing style was sometimes awkward, but the present tense narration was unusually invisible, and I thought Katniss's tone was established early and established well.  She was firm and independent and seriously a nice breath of fresh air after so many YA novels featuring drippy heroines who melt over guys and focus on getting a guy as the center of their lives. Nope, not this girl. Stepping away from the book itself for a moment, I should say that she's kind of important from a feminist standpoint when it comes to literature, and I don't mean that in a silly girl-power way. I mean that the big book-to-movie blockbusters in this era don't have good messages for women at all.  If the protagonist is a girl or a woman in these megahits, her purpose usually focuses primarily or exclusively on a boy or man. And "getting" him means she "wins," and gets "happily ever after." Katniss is important because she shows that a female lead can exist without being dependent on a boy to give her purpose. The only person she truly loves is her sister, so you believe it when she puts it all on the line to protect her, even though she clearly feels that caring makes her vulnerable. When Katniss volunteers for the Games, you can immediately see that she is already being practical about the future, because the wheels are already turning on how not to look weak by crying. And she's all business while saying goodbye to her family. She's prepared for this. She's sixteen, but she's a grown-up, and throughout the rest of the story she thinks about everything she's doing in terms of how it will affect her family, especially her sister Prim. And she doesn't carry the "I'm doing this FOR MY FAMILY" banner for show. It is part of her in the arena, and consistently works as a motivating factor in her thoughts. It isn't a ruse and it's written very well.  I wondered what happened to the other countries outside of Panem, since it's supposed to be only North America. Still, I liked the cultures that were touched on. I liked that the districts were allowed only tiny rebellions like refusing to clap for things they don't agree with. I liked that some of the districts had cultures that encouraged kids to think it was an honor to be chosen for the Games. The whole "blended animals and plants" thing kinda bugged me--how these half-and-half engineered things kept popping up, like "nightlock" (nightshade plus hemlock?) and "mockingjay" (mockingbird plus the invented "jabberjay," though that's intentional). And I didn't completely grok why the Hunger Games are the way they are--there were some halfhearted justifications for why reaping children reminds the districts of the Capitol's power, but I'm hoping this gets fleshed out in later books. As for the Games themselves, it seemed a bit contradictory that the spectators love and reward violence, but then also love and reward emotional attachment. I couldn't quite tell if both were being rewarded because different sponsors like different things, or whether it was just inconsistent for plot purposes.  I like that Katniss doesn't like "owing anyone" and feels like she owes Peeta a thank-you for helping her when she was a kid, and I unexpectedly chuckled when she was thinking about how it'd sound insincere if she thanked him while trying to slit his throat in the Games. She recognizes Peeta's kindness and sees it as a possible ploy right from the beginning, and throws it right back at him--which works to her advantage. This is choreographed to some degree--the organizers of the Games like shaking it up and making a love story happen in the arena--but Katniss plays it all as a game and that's probably one of the most interesting things about her. She actually had layers, and wasn't perfect all the time--the fact that she broke down and cried after losing her temper during her evaluation was particularly telling of the stress that's gotten under her skin--and she's not always self-aware about how she's coming across, like when she denied that she was perceived as "sullen and hostile" while figuring out how to present herself in the interviews. I love that she has so much fire and great points--that she resists giving the Capitol what they want in terms of answers at the interviews because she perceives that they're taking her future already, so what right do they have to suck on her past?  Katniss's emotional roller coaster is well told . . . she's angry about being put in this terrible position and indignant about being expected to go along with the dog and pony show before the Games, but beyond that she has connections and feelings about everyone she comes into contact with--sizing them up, pulling them in, pushing them away. I especially liked how she dealt with the voiceless servant in her room. I was actually more intrigued during the lead-up to the Games than I was during the Games themselves, but I liked how Katniss used what she knew to survive, didn't do absolutely everything right, sometimes got hurt, sometimes had weaknesses, and sometimes had to be saved (but usually by luck or correctly deducing how to manipulate her rescuer, not in the usual "boy saves damsel in distress" way). Her feelings for Peeta were really well handled too; a lot of what she did was for show, because of the situation she was in, but she was not one-dimensional and some of her feelings were conflicting. Even if you're not romantically attracted to someone, it's good to have another person on your side in a scary and desperate situation, and nearly anyone would develop strong feelings of at least protectiveness and appreciation. I loved that the story explored types of caring, intimacy, and love that do not have to be romantic. I don't think she was completely surprised that Peeta's feelings were different from her own, though she did seem sort of a little confused and disappointed to know that he wasn't faking anything he did for the cameras.  I'd say it annoyed me how there were so many indirect deaths--because that happens a lot in violent books when the main character is to be kept pristine, so the enemies die by accident, by each other's hand, or by natural causes--but this thing overall annoyed me less because Katniss did kill one person completely fairly and another person straightforwardly when the opponent couldn't fight back, so she didn't come through the Games with no blood on her hands. But for a plot so vicious and bloody, there really were a lot of indirect deaths--Katniss was directly involved with someone dying from insect bites, dying from poison, etc. I won't go into detail (so I can avoid spoilers), but I thought the ending was a great mini-rebellion. I actually saw the twist coming (and hoped it wasn't going to happen, even though it seemed inevitable), but I liked how they twisted the twist, which sets the scene for . . . future books. (You can tell more were planned by certain little aspects of how particular characters acted.) And I really appreciated that they did NOT just cut off at the end with a victory; they actually showed some aftermath and some reacting and some of the reward that the tributes had fought so hard for--and some of the consequences.
I quite enjoyed this book. I wasn't entirely sure what I was getting myself into, as I hate ruining things for myself by listening to other peoples critiques of things, but I'm really glad I gave this book a chance.  You should be aware that this is a review based on my having not seen the movie yet, just reading the book itself.  I was originally told the book was a mix of a dystopian world with "Battle Royale" mixed in. I've seen Battle Royale (have not read the book), and I have to say this book is a lot more like BR than I anticipated. BR is the epitome of a dystopian world, and Hunger Games follows directly in its tracks. I was rather surprised to find out that Suzanne Collins had neither read, watched nor even heard of BR when she wrote The Hunger Games. I'm not entirely sure if I believe that, seeing the extreme similarity between the two.  Onto the book itself! The further into the book I got, the more I felt the need to read the book. It's honestly like an addiction - the author gives you a little taste of the world for free in the first couple of chapters and once you're hooked, you're up at 3am trying to find out what happens next. Not that that...you know...happened. Or anything.  I loved the little tidbits of introduction to the world of Panem - the history of the world they now live in and how they got to the way they are now. I was grasping for more information on this history, but the author certainly knows what she's doing...slow release - keeps us coming back for more!  The character development is pretty damned good. The sense of adventure, dire need to survive...I don't know that I would actually change anything about the book.  Read it, jump on the bandwagon - it's really just "one of those books".
I read the The Hunger Games almost accidentally - it happened to be at the top of the list of Kindle books I could borrow while trying out Amazon Prime, and I remember seeing an entertainment news personality excitedly discussing the upcoming movie, so I figured why not. And one bleary-eyed all-nighter later, I'd finished it. The action is compelling, the vision of this dystopian future is fascinating, and the concept of the Hunger Games - kids fighting to the death in a combination of gladiatorial and MacGyver combat - is original and twisted. So I was pretty surprised later to hear that this is a "teen" novel (but I'm glad to see some teens are reading this instead of Twilight - after two pages of that I thought my brain would explode, just like when two teenage girls sat near me at the local pizza parlor and talked about boys and texting for half an hour. Substitute vampires for texting). I suppose I should have been tipped off by the oh-no-two-boys-love-me-what-shall-I-do handwringing, which was getting on getting on my nerves, but I do like the Katniss's attitude of I-don't-have-time-for-this-I'm-on-a-mission. Literally, she's trying to be the breadwinner. Now that's a modern (or really, postmodern) woman. And I'll admit it, I was getting into the romantic aspects, to the point where I was wondering about the chasteness of the whole book (another tip that it's targeted to the teen demographic). But I'm not embarrassed to be a fan of this story. I'm really not. Especially after I just read in the sporting news that LeBron James has been reading Mockingjay (the third in this trilogy) in the locker room before each game of the Heat-Celtics series, including his 45-point high-percentage Game Six. I wonder when he was raining down all those shots if he felt like Katniss letting fly an arrow.
A lot of hype surrounds Suzanne Collinss The Hunger Games trilogy. The novels have been international best-sellers and have spawned a successful movie franchise. The premise for the trilogy certainly isnt new, however, and it can be argued that it was a case of Collinss manuscript being in the right place at the right time. In 1999 Japanese author Koushan Takami had his novel, Battle Royale, published, and it follows a similar theme  teens in a dystopian future battling it out to the death, their efforts televised.  In Collinss vision, the region once known as the US has been reduced to 12 districts subservient to a decadent Capitol. Each year, each district has to send tributes  a boy and a girl  to compete in the annual Hunger Games, the ultimate in reality TV. The winner not only gets to live, but will have enough food to eat for the rest of their life, in addition to being a celebrity.  Indeed, there is little that is more chilling than the individuals objectification and loss of sovereignty. The novels apt nod towards ancient Rome is a not-so-subtle dig at the socioeconomic disparities of those times.  Our protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, steps into the arena when she volunteers to take her younger sisters place as tribute. Her hunting skills also makes her an ideal contender. She is well aware that the stakes are high, but her emotions become conflicted when she gets to know the other candidate from her district  Peeta.  Herein lies the rub  and the almost ubiquitous young adult love triangle. Katniss is in denial about her feelings towards her best friend back in the district, but Peeta has apparently held a torch for Katniss for ages. She just never knew about it until now. While they play out a supposedly sham romance for the benefit of their viewers, Katniss questions her own loyalties. At some point she might have to kill Peeta.  Some might find the casual violence in the novel shocking, but it pales in comparison to the gladiators in the popular television series Spartacus, where main characters kill their opponents without compunction.  The Hunger Games presents an ideal vehicle in which to examine how being in the arena would affect young Katniss. Her kills are mostly by accident rather than design. Katniss faces challenge after challenge, yet one does not step away with the sense that she has grown much as a character. Indeed, in that respect, the ending goes off like the proverbial damp squib.  While The Hunger Games is an adequate dystopian read, by the same measure I feel the hype surrounding it has hugely inflated its popularity. Dont expect literary fireworks.
I don't know how to start reviewing this book at all!  I have been putting off reading this book since - well, forever and I regret it!  It was a few years ago when I started reading this book but did not finish it and last Christmas, I actually bought a hardbound set of the Trilogy.  It wasn't until last week (YES LAST WEEK!) that I decided to try it in audiobook format.  I wasn't disappointed.  Although I had seen the movie before, it hadn't ruined my reading Hunger Games.  The book feels more raw than the movie ever did (movie review soon).  I love Suzanne Collins' writing.  The first person narration was not annoying to read and I love reading Katniss' thoughts.  Katniss Everdeen is a very unique heroine.  I absolutely love her.  And since I have read all three books, I love her all the more.  Her multidimensional character is very unique, especially in the saturated YA genre with female heroines.  In fact, I have never read about any YA heroine that can match her.  I struggled with her and rooted for her throughout the Games.  Collins' world building is exceptional.  She describes everything with great detail where I can imagine what everything looks like despite of seeing the movie first.  All her characters are multidimensional, unique in their own way and very very different.  The Hunger Games is a masterpiece.  5 FREAKING hearts!  I also want to add that I do not like the cover.  In fact, when I saw this at the bookstore, it did not make me want to pick it up!  Maybe the book cover influenced my decision for not finishing it?  THE AUDIOBOOK  Narrated by Carolyn McCormick, I had a problem with the audiobook.  For the first few chapters, I felt her narration was a little bit stiff and monotone which felt a little bit like she was reading to a child.  Well, granting that this is a YA book, but still!  The voices that she used for Prim and Effie where very annoying.  I was able to tune out on the voices that she used after that and I was very glad that her narration did not turn me off from finishing the book!
I was surprised that a book about the gladiatory style of murdering adolescents wasn't that violent of a story at all. Which was good. I don't want to read about how Tiny Tim got his throat slit with heavy detail. The Hunger Games is a cleverly written novel that the movie has captured perfectly. Suzanne Collins takes an interesting approach about the government ruling over its people in a new and sinister way.  After a massive uprising against the government, the rebellion was crushed miserably. As penance for the revolution, the government has created the Hunger Games, which is a fight to the death of chosen children from the remaining Districts.  2 children are taken from each District and thrown into the games every year. This is to remind the people of the world "Don't @#$% with the government".  The story follows the point of view of Katniss Everdeen, a girl who volunteers to be put into the Hunger Games after her younger sister is picked. She puts on a brave face throughout her times before the game, but the first person view lets you know what exactly is going through her mind. The movie cannot portray those feelings.  The only problem I had with the book, but still makes sense as I write this in the grant scheme of the story, is that one child survives at the end of the Games. I thought it would make sense to have the "pair" of chosen children get to survive the games. But that could just be the makers of the Games creating an even more sinister games.  Imagine killing your neighbor, or your neighbors child? Makes the Games take on a worse look to them.  This was a great novel which sets a solid tone for the rest of the series. Hope you check it out as well. 4/5  Joe Reyes  Check out my blog for more reviews http://wellthatsdifferent.wordpress.com/
I was very curious to read this book, since I finally watched the entirety of the movie. I'm well aware that when book are turned into movies, the movie always loses something in the transaction. While the movie wasn't a huge deal for me, I was interested to see how far the movie strayed from the book and what the book had to offer that the movie lacked. As it turns out, I think the book is better than the movie, although the movie does do a pretty good job of portraying the main story.  Probably what I loved most about the book was Katniss' point of view and thinking process. Since it was exclusively from her point, the reader could only know facts which Katniss herself knew. While it at times it was possible to understand other characters' ulterior motives and plans, it was interesting to see how Katniss put the pieces together herself. I liked the reality that while the "romance" between her and Peeta is what ultimately saves both of them, she had a hard time separating what was her own true feelings and setting them aside from the act. Her confusion over her own thoughts and feelings were easy to relate to and made her a stronger character in the long run.  I know there are some pretty strong viewpoints on this book--some people things its over the top great, while others are crazy against it due to the violence. I think Collins did a good job of using the scenario in order to portray her real point--we, as humans, are quickly becoming desensitized the the violence in the world, and to some degree and turning to a point where it's used for enjoyment (ex., violence based movies). The point of the book was to bring awareness to this fact through an extremely exaggerated scenario--and I think it worked. I would recommend this book to an audience who will understand the agenda of the book and keep it in mind. I bought this book, and therefore was not asked nor required to write a review. These opinions are my own; I was not required to write a positive review, nor was I compensated for this review.
I was really wary of this book because it sounded a lot like the story of Battle Royale, and I didn't want to read another story like that. I was also wary of a reality TV show type of game, and the bloody, deadliness of it. When I finally read this book I was so hooked into it that I quickly got through all three of the books. This is the best collection of books I have read in years and my absolute favorite books of all time. I fell in love with these elements:  -Katniss Everdeen just sprung off the pages for me, what amazing character development and what a sweet and very honest and real depiction of a teenage girl's nature. I love that she grows up with us through the series, and she is incredible in how she handles her war torn situation. When I was creating my main character Mya Brand, for my book 'In Ark: A Promise of Survival', I looked to Collins creation of Katniss Everdeen to understand how to build out a character. My Mya and Katniss are very different, but I hope my storytelling is similarly engaging to what Collins has achieved.  -It is incredible what this series of books does for the topic of war. Suzanne Collins skillfully portrays the horror of war, but in a way that also gives you insight to how and why it can come about, and just how complicated it all is. What Collins did for war is what I have tried to do in my first book 'In Ark: A Promise of Survival' for climate change.  -The pace and the unbelieveable "page turner" and "can't put it down" factors of this book just blew me away. Chapter after chapter left me wanting more of this story. I really tried to keep a similar pace in my 'In Ark: A Promise of Survival' and so far the feedback I'm getting is that I achieved this!  -I love, love, love the futuristic dystopian world Collins has created and especially the fashions and styles. This layer of visual presentation really gives the book a rich dimension where you can picture what the people of this future world look like. And I love that Katniss gets a stylist -- I want a stylist!!!  I know it is weird to try to tell you about my own book here. But 'The Hunger Games' was so important to me and, in part, compelled me to sit down for many hours at my computer, over two years, and try so hard to write a book for the first time. I plan a trilogy of my 'Mya and Ark' series that I dream will be as engaging and entertaining -- and enlightening as 'The Hunger Games.'
In Panam which use to be North America, there are 12 districts that all surround a single capital. Years ago there was an outbreak, a rebellion if you will, and the capital struck back hard by completely destroying and leveling district 13. Ever since then they made the other 12 districts hand over one boy and one girl as tributes for this thing called the Hunger Games, which is pretty much a battle royal to the death with kids ages 12-18. The point is to intimidate the districts that they are inferior to the capital and that they can do what they want. Katniss Everdeen who is the main character in this book was pushed to willingly volunteer to save her 12 year old sisters life from being thrown away in the hunger games. She later partners up with a girl from district 11 as well as begins to develope feelings for her fellow contender from her district even though she fully knows that only one can live. She does her best to stay out of combat to leave each other to kill themselves off. Along with several twists the Capital throws at them for the viewing pleasure of all of panam to watch. After reading this book i was disappointed. Disappointed that the book was over, this book had me on the edge of my seat at times, laughing and even close to making me cry. This is a really enjoyable book that you can easily get into and connect with the characters and feel for them. Dont be surprised if you find yourself rooting for a character in the book to win. The auther used teenages as all the main characters which i believe makes it easier to get wrapped up into it and to connect.  The book was amazing and easily 20 times better than the movie and more detailed and you can almost imagine yourself spectating the games. I would suggest this book to any teen or young adult, it definitely gives you a different look on how life could be.
I read The Hunger Games on the recommendation of a friend, and while I enjoyed reading it, I wouldnt necessarily rank it among my all-time favorites. The story definitely sucks the reader in, and I enjoyed reading about the futuristic world Collins created, but some parts were so skimmed over that it made me wonder if Collins had really fleshed them out, even in her own mind. For example, the history of Panem and the Dark Days that led to the inception of the Hunger Games. How did one city manage to overpower the rest of the nation? What was the crime of the red-headed girl who had her tongue cut out as punishment? Fleshing out some of these details would have made the world of Panem more real to me. And I couldnt help envisioning the Capitol as the Emerald City of Oz, due to Collins descriptions of people with vibrantly colored hair, crazy outfits, and skin dyed pea green.  ** spoiler alert **  Other details about the Games themselves bothered me - like the sponsored gifts delivered via silver parachutes. Wouldnt items falling from the sky tip off other contestants as to the whereabouts of their opponents? Why doesn't Katniss ever see any of the omnipresent cameras? How do the cameras penetrate the barrier of the cozy little cave she builds for her and Peeta?  Probably the biggest problem with the book is that Collins allows our heroes to emerge victorious from the games without really coming face to face with any real moral dilemma. Most of the other tributes' deaths are taken care of for them. When she does finally kill Cato, it's more to put him out of his misery at the hands of the mutated wolves. She doesn't have to kill Thresh, who spared her. Nor do we ever hear how Cato overpowered Thresh, which surely would have been featured in the three-hour highlight presentation.  Collins also spends a lot of time on potential plot points that never go anywhere. A lot of time is spent on Madge's gold pin -- so much that I expected it to turn into some sort of weapon or otherwise assist Katniss. But no. There's also a lot of mystery about the drop-off on the other side of the cornucopia, but it only turns out to be a field of tall grass where Thresh is hiding. It seems like there was a lot of wasted opportunity to throw some really interesting twists into the narrative. And given the high levels of praise heaped on The Hunger Games, I was really expecting some sort of amazing revelations towards the end, but none came. Everything moved along fairly predictably, and given the first-person narration of the book, its always a safe bet that our heroine will make it out alive. The only real question is if Peeta will survive as well. But moments of tension that the author tries to introduce towards the end are wrapped up rather quickly, leading to a somewhat abrupt ending.
This book is excellent for both genders and of any age. Get off your butt and go read it. You are probably saying, "I already watched this movie in a theater or on Netflix." Even if that is so, go buy this novel because the movie is not on par with the amazingness of the book. The Hunger Games is a fast-paced, easy read, so you won't have a lazy excuse to skip this great book. It is actually likely that you will find that this book finishes way too quickly and you will instantly reach for the next book in the series. In the book you will discover information that the movie fails to show. For example, there is a story of an Avox girl in the book that you will not see in the movie. This story is an important development in Katniss's (main character) mental conflicts. She is conflicted by the memory of the Avox girl and wishes to help the girl but cant. She almost breaks down, but is able to pull together by the comforting of the Avox girl. Another scene not as developed in the movie is the time spent in the arena. In the book that time feels like weeks and seem more desperate for Katniss than shown in the movie. This is simply because a movie is not able to include every bit of information, otherwise the movie would last for hours (cough, cough the Hobbit, the Desolation of Smaug). The book, in many ways, also has better version of events. For example, remember the scary dogs in the arena. In the book the dogs are not even dogs, they are mutant creatures that have a combination of body parts from fallen tributes. This frightens the heck out of Katniss because she sees the resemblance of a fallen tributes eyes in the mutant creature. This is much scarier than those silly dogs. Another detail that you will notice is the better description of other districts and their tributes. In the movie it was not said as much about the different districts, but the book will clarify them and their tributes. The more details of the characters enhances the story because you are going be more mesmerized and invested in the story. I rated this book four out of five because even though it was exciting, there were some  breaks in the suspension of disbelief. At times, I would question the society and reasoning behind events. For example, I am confused of why they use train when they have gigantic hovercrafts that is able to transport people great distances over a short amount of time. It would make sense if they just used the hovercraft. I guess thats just me. I also dont like the fact that the game makers are able to easily change the rules of the game. I seems as a easy way for the author to add suspension at the end the story. There are couple little things I question, like the aide being sent to Katniss. It those aides were parachuted, wouldn't the other tributes be able to track her by following the parachutes. Those are the little things that bug me, other than that the book is fun to read. When you finish reading this book, you will thank me because you will be better fulfilled with the Hunger Games experience. You wont be able to wait to read the next book, Catching Fire.
This book was awesome. I saw the movie before I read the book, and usually when I read the book after I see the movie, it is hard to imagine the characters being anything different than the movie. I tend to skip parts in the book because I know what will happen. The author Suzanne Collins has a great imagination and great attention to detail, and after reading this book I have a better understanding of the characters and the story. The book has quite a bit of violence, but the violence is pretty unrealistic. The Hunger Games is classified as a young adult book. I think this is true because of the love story between Katniss and Peeta, as well as Katniss coming of age, and the violence. The young adult classification might deter the older audience that might enjoy it as much as I did.    The Capitol is a highly advanced society comprised of untouchables. These untouchables are not subjected to the annual Hunger Games. The sponsors are highly affluential and influential with regards to the games. They literally have the tributes lives in their hands. Each district has a purpose to serve the Capitol with goods and services. The people of The Capitol have a snobbish disregard for the welfare and humanity of the districts citizens. Which angers the citizens of the districts. I like how Collins has Katniss volunteer as tribute to protect her sister. Katniss knows she can survive whereas her sister cannot. I can relate to Katniss wanting to protect her family, and would do anything to accomplish that. I also understand Katniss being misunderstood by The Capitol. They see Katniss as being rebellious. When really she just wants to be left alone to take care of her family, and not to conform to societies celebrity status, which shes ironically obtained by taking care of her sister.    While the movies are great the book is better. I cannot wait to finish the other two books. The characters are well written and the plot will be interesting to see where it goes. Whether you are a young adult or an old adult you will enjoy this book as well as the whole series.
What if you were one of twenty-four kids that got chosen to fight for you life, what would you do? The Hunger Games is a Science Fiction book by Suzanne Collins.   This books is about the story of a Sixteen-year-old girl named Katniss Everdeen. Katniss takes her sister, Prim's place in annual televised event called, "The Hunger Games." Katniss goes into the, "Hunger Games," with her fellow tribute Peeta. But, will Peeta and Katniss work together in the Games? The Hunger Games takes place during the Games. The Games are in an arena trying to look like a forest.  Katniss has a hard time without her family around her during the games. During the Games Katniss finds a tribute that reminds her of her younger sister Prim. Katniss and that tribute become close. Another conflict that Katniss had, was surviving. The Games are a very harsh televised event that goes on every year. During the Games Katniss fights for her life and always tries her hardest.   I thought that this book was one of the best books I have ever read! I really thought that Suzanne did an excellent job writing this book. While reading this book I was never able to put it down. This book was definitely intense because of the killing that was going on in the Games. I thought that it was hard sometimes to see a character you love die. This book was definitely one of my all time favorites.   I think that everyone should eventually read this The Hunger Games. I think that kids from the age ten up should at least try to read The Hunger Games.  I think that ten should be the youngest to read this book because there is violence in this book. If I read this before I was ten, I would definitely have nightmares. Overall, I think that this was an excellent book in every way.
How would you feel if you were one of 24 teenagers chose to fight for your life in a battle where only one person wins? The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is an emotional and inspiring Science Fiction Novel.  16 year old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to represent her district in the Hunger Games so her sister Prim, who was randomly chosen doesn't have to. The Hunger Games is a televised competition in an arena which is programmed by computers to feel and look like a forest.  Each of the  twelve districts randomly select a male and a female tribute to fight each other to death in an arena where only one tribute wins. Katniss is determined to survive and make it back to her district to, her mother, her sister Prim and her best-friend and hunting partner Gale. As you could imagine, it's not an easy task. She's a human being, with feelings and realizes that killing a human is different than killing an animal, which she's done for most of her life. Her fellow tribute from her district (the male), Peeta Mellark is a sweet and loveable boy. But, Katniss seems to not be able to trust him or figure out how she feels about him.  I really enjoyed reading  The Hunger Games. I think that Collins did a very good job giving Katniss a believable and unique voice. I also think the way the structure of the book works really well. Though, at times it was really hard to read-- I think that the hard topics the book deals with are necessary to convey what the Hunger Games were really about for young Katniss Everdeen.  People in 6th grade and up should read this book for a story that will keep you turning pages like there's no tomorrow. I don't think anyone younger than 6th Grade should not read this book because it is very graphic and intense at times.  Also, people should read this because it teaches the reader to stand up for what they believe in and never back down. But, all readers of The Hunger Games should be warned to have a box of tissues on hand while reading.
Action, suspense, drama, conspiracy, love, friendship, trust, and life or death are all major themes present in Suzanne Collinss incredible novel, The Hunger Games. It is without a doubt the best book I have ever read and deserves a five out of five star rating from all its readers. The plot is fantastic, and the character development is phenomenal. Katniss Everdeen, the main character, lives in a post-apocalytpic society divided into twelve districts. Wealth is the greatest in the first district, and decreases as the district number gets higher. The capitol keeps the districts united by force. Katniss belongs to the poorest twelfth district. A former thirteenth district rebelled against the capitol and was destroyed. As a result, every year, the capitol holds the Hunger Games. In the games, a boy a girl between the ages of twelve and sixteen are chosen to compete in a battle to the death. The victor to be awarded with the highest honor and live in riches for the rest of their life. Katnisss sister, Primrose, in her first year as part of the raffle, is chosen to compete for district twelve in the games. Then, Katniss cries, I volunteer as tribute! Moreover, Katniss ends up competing in the games for district twelve with Peeta Mellark, a classmate. The story gets juicy when they get to the capitol and arrive the games, so Ill let you find that out yourself. Whats also great about the story are the fragments of underlying themes in the story. Obviously a battle to the death is action-packed, but the horror and suspense is unbearable. In the movie jaws, the shark does not need to be seen to be frightening. Its more terrifying as an unknown beast. This book is scary in a very similar way. Also, there is plenty of love and drama between Katniss, Peeta, Primrose, as well as Cinna and Rue, who youll have to read about. Overall this story is a great read for all peoples over the age of about twelve. It is a clear five star novel by Suzanne Collins.
*contains spoilers*  I really loved this book.  However, since I'm sure a million trillion people have written reviews about it, I'm not going to bother with that.  However, there is one really unique thing about this book for me, and that is that I think it is the only book I have EVER read that I cannot decide whether or not I liked it better than the movie.  It's not that I liked the movie better than the book.  And it's not that I liked the book better than the movie.  It is that I HONESTLY can't decide which I liked better.  So, instead of an actual review, that is what I'm going to talk about here.  :-D  There were things in both the book and the movie that I really loved that weren't in the other.  For instance, the movie has all of the insight into what is going on in the minds of the gamemasters and President Snow and even Haymitch.  The viewer really gets a sense of how all those people think and operate and what the politics are like in Panem.  Since the book is written solely from Katniss' point of view, the reader misses out on a lot of that simply because Katniss can't be everywhere at once.  While she is in the arena, she has no idea that there is rioting going on in Rue's district or that President Snow is getting angrier and more impatient each time she doesn't die.  There was so much in the movie that wasn't in the books, and for once, I think Hollywood actually got something right by adding these things.  As a gigantic book nerd, I'm usually a stickler for keeping as close to the books as possible when a movie is made, but the additions made in the Hunger Games movie were actually really great and enjoyable.  However, there were also several, several, SEVERAL things in the book that a reader gets to experience that a movie-goer doesn't.  For instance, the movie barely even scratches the surface of the real motivation behind the budding relationship between Katniss and Peeta, and all of the inner turmoil and confusion Katniss feels about her feelings for Gale and Peeta.... that is COMPLETELY absent from the flick.  Furthermore, there is so much more detail about Katniss' life, family, and district that really enriches the novel.  I would have liked to have seen more of that in the movie.  Furthermore, I loved the recap of the games at the end that Peeta and Katniss are forced to watch near the end of the book.  The movie-goer assumes that Peeta had only ganged up with the Careers in order to both stay alive AND protect Katniss, but honestly, there is no proof ever given in the show.  However, in the book, Katniss and Peeta must watch the recap of the highlights of the games.  This point is when Katniss finds out FOR SURE that Peeta NEVER intended to hurt her.  She had suspected it before then, but seeing the way he behaved when he was not around her via the recap is the definitive proof that she -- and the reader (or viewer) -- has so far lacked.  So yes.  In conclusion, GREAT FREAKING BOOK... and a great movie as well.  Even after breaking them both down a bit, I still am not sure which one I like best.
Reviewed on FicCentral.com:  Life isnt easy in District 12, but sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen does what little she can to keep her mother and sister fed and safe, including poaching outside the district fence, and then adding her name to the Hunger Games lottery multiple times in exchange for food when her meager hunting spoils arent enough.  So when young Primrose Everdeens name is called out the very first time shes in the drawing, Katniss does the only thing she can.  She volunteers, taking her sisters place in a deadly arena with two tributes from each district.  Only one is allowed to return alive.  Leaving the only home shes ever known with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark, Katniss travels to the glittering, colorful Capital, so different from her own dreary district.  While those in District 12 toil in the coal mines, want for even the most basic necessities like food, and shuffle along through days blanketed in gray and despair, the Capital shines, its citizen decked out in wild fashions, feasting on delicacies, and gleefully looking forward to a group of teenagers being forced to kill or be killed in an arena filled with unimaginable hazards  and cameras to broadcast the fun.  But shes up against people whove trained their whole lives to win the Games, not to mention a few who are far too young to be subjected to this kind of violence.  And Peeta they dont really know each other, but he gave her food once when she had nothing, and hes as much of a friend as anyone can be in a situation where youre supposed to kill everyone else.  How is she supposed to survive physically, much less emotionally, when the only way she can walk out with her life is to kill even him?  But...  Theres an incredible sense of despair throughout the book, which while purposely there, can really drag a reader down.  Its not reason enough to avoid the story, but make sure you wait until youre in the mood for angst and drama before picking this one up.  But really the only thing I didnt like about the story was Katnisss distance from any positive emotions.  Shes alternately angry and sad and depressed and resolved, but never is she truly happy.  Again, it is absolutely necessary due to the nature of the story (not to mention the dystopian world in which she lives), but its a tough emotional read when everything is fear and loss and fighting for survival.  Still, Katniss fights on in the face of almost certain death, so perhaps its that personal strength that I should be respecting instead.  The Verdict...  Truly an incredible story.  Dystopian isnt my usual fare, though I dip in every now and then, but Ive never read anything like this. Veronica Roth has created a world so different from our own, yet where inherent human flaws are brightly paralleled in both the Games and the people.  The disparities in wealth, the shallowness of those living in the capital, the exploitation of the underprivileged, and the extreme lengths to which those in power will go to remain in control.  Its altogether fascinating and frightening, with a little love triangle thrown in for good measure.  Because post apocalyptic or not, teenagers will always find someone to crush on.
I had heard good things about this book/series from many people - heck, it's even being made into a movie.  I figured it must be something spectacular, right?  I felt The Hunger Games was a good story overall, but there were a few small things which took away from it for me.  I felt that there were several instances of poor grammar being used.  I'm a bit confused as to if this is something the author just does not know the correct way to write, or if the author does this on purpose - as the book is written in first person, and the sporadic instances of such grammar could be explained away as a character quirk.  Either way, it did not make the story or book any less pleasant overall, but I did find myself stumbling over the words and having to re-read a sentence here and there to understand what the author was trying to say.  Thankfully this is not an overly common complaint I have with the book.  The author did a good job in sucking me into the characters far enough that while I wasn't going to yell or cry about them, I did feel a little for them, and wanted to know what was going to happen to them.  But, at the same time, it was obvious the book was written with a female touch: I (as a guy) felt myself shaking my head in disbelief at many of the thoughts the main character (a girl) had, and how she interpreted the other (male) characters actions and thoughts.  Once or twice I caught my self wanting to proclaim that she was an idiot for her perception - and the reader does not get any insider information about what else is going on, as the book is first person as I mentioned - so, if I was able to pick up on these things, why is the main character oblivious?  Well, we all see things differently, I know.  But these are just in-your-face things that she just doesn't "get".  It made me question her social and interpretive skills - again, explained away as 'character'.  On that note, I felt that perhaps the book would be a much more exciting read for a girl, as the author chooses to provide quite vague descriptions of the female characters, but goes into almost romance-novel depth of details with the male characters physiques.  It felt odd to me how disproportionate it was.  Females could be the intended audience, though - I have no idea of the author's intent.  I was excited to see how the book ended, but I did not feel encouraged to read the second book in the series.  There was nothing left to be told in the tale at the end, in my opinion.  I do think I will read the next book, because I do like to complete series, but I did not have the urge to go out and get it immediately after finishing The Hunger Games.
The book is very well written and beautifully structured tale of survival in a world gone mad.  The former United States of America was hit with some kind of apocalypse and only those living in the Capitol have any kind of comfortable living.  Every year one member of each of the poorer sections of the country - nicknamed Districts - is selected to enter a tournament where all those selected fight for their own survial.  This is where we meet the stars of the show.  First and foremost is Katniss Everdeen, whose father was killed in a mining accident when she was a little  girl.  Since that point she has been the rock her family depends on as her mother is but a shadow of her former self since the loss of her husband.  She is from District 12 and is remarkably talented with a bow and arrow and of course she is not stupid, either.  Other members of the cast are introduced to the reader as you progress through the story.  Some are friends to Kat, some are not and some are not at all obvious.  The book itself is very hard to put down, and not just due to the cliffhangers that are used at the end of every chapter, which will make you keep reading until the battery in your kindle wears out.  The story is tense and terrific and the fight scenes are perfectly drawn in your mind.  Elements are there to define the tale as science fiction but it certainly could not be described as such.  The emotional attachment to Kat is strong due to the sacrifices she has made already in her young life.  Of course the reader is scared something dreadful will happen to our young hero so that is one more reason to turn each page with trepidation.  I give this book four stars.  It may be worth more but as it is book one of a trilogy one has to leave room for improvement.  But this is a modern day classic that should be read by everyone.  A truly fantastic and original idea that has been brilliantly executed.  BFN Greggorio!
The first sentence alone is enough to make me throw up and chuck the book out the window. Two problems, I read from a Kindle Paperweight (which I love), and the movie was actually pretty good. Obviously the Author did something right . . . so I pressed on.  Everyone knows that Hunger Games is a pretty neat story by now. Maybe you've seen the movies and now your ready to give it a read. I urge you not to read the book not because it is bad, but because the movies were better and it isn't worth killing your brain cells trying to figure out how the book was written. So - Since we already know that the story is great, hence the 4-Star review, let's talk about why the book could have been better.  It is all a matter of perspective. The use of First-Person, in the present perspective, has never been done correctly. No one has found a way to make it work. Veronica Roth, Suzanne Collins, Tim Lebbon - All of them have failed to make this perspective work. In my opinion, Present tense only works in short bits to call emphasis on fast running emotions, and character confusion. Using this for an entire novel drowns the reader in narrow minded, limited voice of the main character. The creativity put into the movie to show what was happening beyond Katniss' perspective will not be found in the book. Some of the scenes in the movie were better than how they played out in the book as well.  To make matters worse, Katniss as a character (in the book) is not the tough chick introduced to us in the movie. Katniss is whiny, narrow minded, ignorant, and too much of a 14 year-old as opposed to the 17 year-old she is supposed to be. She is written as immature, scared, and confused. This never changes throughout the entire novel. The movie shows character growth and progression; the book does not.  Now - the second reason why "The Hunger Games" falls short. SPOILER ALERT! If you don't like spoilers, stop reading. I'm assuming you've already seen the movie. The Author took the easy way out. In a book about an arena death match between kids; Katniss was never faced with the situation in which she had to kill someone she liked. Rue was the perfect candidate - but instead she was murdered as part of the game and it forced Katniss to defend herself.  At no point, not even the climatic end - did Katniss actually take a life without the act being done in self-defense. Instead, the area let loose a bunch of hounds and the beasts did the job for her. The way the movie ended was better - but still left Katniss out of a situation of becoming a murderer. This robs the reader of an incredibly powerful, and emotional event that's assumed to be included in the book's premise. The author, in my opinion, cheated the reader from the cruel reality of her book. Because of this, "The Hunger Games" *almost* glamorizes the idea of this type of death match. Just take a look at the Hunger Games themed camps and events cropping up throughout the nation.  In short - The story is good. The writing is bad. The Author is afraid of her own premise. But, somehow . . . through it all - She wrote a book worth turning into a movie. Take my advice, watch the movie and leave it at that. Reading this trilogy will leave you feeling upset, disappointed, and utterly confused as to how the movies could be created on such a loosely, and poorly written book.
I loved The Hunger Games because it is so cleverly written. So what if it's written in the past tense! It is written from her perspective anyway! To those who say The Hunger Games was depressing, either read it again and keep in mind that in Catching Fire and Mockingjay things change (you have no idea what your are missing out on), or read it when you get older.  Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl from the Seam( the poor parts of District 12 ) is chosen as one of the tributes for district 12 to compete in The 75th Hunger Games. Her sister, Primrose Everdeen, was originally chosen to go but Katniss volunteered to take Prim's place. She goes with Peeta Mellark to The Games. The big problem is he has had a crush on her ever since he laid eyes on her.  That is a problem because the Hunger Games works like this: 24 tributes are sent to the Capitol ( the main city of Panem, which was once know as North America ) to train and gain.   They will need training because the tributes will fight for survival until one victor remains. The reason there even is a Hunger Games is because their was an uprising in the districts ( there was 13 districts but now only 12 remain due to the fact that district 13 was burned down and the other districts are now under control of the Capitol ). After the uprising was contained, the Capitol decided to make the districts pay for what they had done. So every year a girl and a boy tribute from each district will be chosen to go to the Hunger Games. The tributes must be between ages 12 and 18 to go.   The tributes will have to gain by making an appearance and be liked by their mentors so they can get sponsors. Sponsors mean medicine,food, water and many other supplies to help keep the liked tribute alive. If you are not liked then the odds are not in your favor. ;)  I would recommend this book for people who enjoy action and are older than 10. It is an awesome book! A definite must read!
The Hunger Games takes place in the nation of Panem, which is in the ruins of North America.  Each year, Panem sends two tributes from twelve districts to fight to the death in an arena.  Only one tribute can survive, and they get fame and riches when they return to their district.  The districts are scattered across the nation surrounding the Capitol.  The author makes District 12 seem dark and neglected, but when Katniss, the main character, becomes a tribute from there and goes to the Capitol, her eyes are opened to a new, brighter world.  All of the tributes are hauled away to fight to the death for the entertainment of the Capitol.  Katniss, who is also the protagonist, knows that the Hunger Games are wrong.  Peeta, the male tribute from District 12, understands that the Hunger Games are wrong, but is more focused on staying alive and not letting the Hunger Games change him.  He even states, I dont want them to change me in there.  Turn me into some kind of monster that Im not. He thinks that people should stay true to themselves even if the majority is telling them different.  The story starts with Katniss telling of one of her hunting stories with Gale, who is one of Katnisss friends.  It is the day of the reaping which is when the capitol picks the tributes.  Katniss volunteers after her sister is called and takes her place as a tribute.  Shortly after, Peeta is picked and peacefully takes his place as the second tribute for District 12.  After being swept off to the Capitol and into the arena, Katniss knows she must try to stay alive.  Katniss knows that she is not a killer, but the Hunger Games start to change her as she realizes that she must to survive.  She realizes that if she doesnt win, someone will kill her because there can only be one winner of the Hunger Games.  The story drags on as Katniss is just focusing on running away from the other tributes and trying not to starve.  She encounters other tributes as she sees them or hears them from a tree, and sees alliances that have formed for the games.  One thing that was hard to understand was why everyone in the Capitol is nice to the new tributes, if they are about to watch them die.  The people of the capitol almost seem happy to see the new tributes, so it makes me wonder why they still want to see them die.  Another thing that I wondered about is how the Gamemakers, who are the people who control the Hunger Games, can have cameras everywhere in the arena.  In one part of the book, Katniss is in a cave and there is a camera in there with her.  This would mean that there would have to have been cameras there when they started the games so, they could have known that she would have been in there, or there are cameras every couple feet in the arena.  I think that the author could have been more clear about that.   People should stay true to themselves even if the majority is telling them different.  I think thats the message that Suzanne Collins is trying to get through to the reader in The Hunger Games.  I think that The Hunger Games was well written and had a great concept.  There were a lot of details and I would definitely recommend it to someone.  There are also two other books in the series that come after The Hunger Games.
The best books stay with you a while.  I would like to write this review both as a heads up to Christians and to writers. It took me a while to climb aboard the Hunger Games phenom. I was not sure, as a Christian, if these were books I should even read, given the theme. It took a lot of listening and learning before I felt I should give them a chance.  I admit I watched the movie first, only recently. I was so impressed with how the subject matter was handled that I knew I would have to read the series. I think a lot of the discussion among the Christian community, is that since they are books for young adults, should you allow your teen to read the books or watch the movies? Since I have only elementary children in my household, I would have a hard time judging that, though I think i would probably make mine wait until late high school/college age (which is what I would consider young adulthood anyway, but often this segment does mix in with the teen demo as well). There is little or no language in the books, and no sexual references, though (SPOILER ALERT) in the second book, there is a lot of them sleeping in the same bed together, to ward off nightmares. However, the violence is pretty intense in all three. As to writers, I think every writer should read these books. To me, they are a perfect template on how to create plot, characters, and inner and outer conflict. Let me also say, that this is not a genre I normally gravitate to. It seems to me that the dystopian society storyline has been done to death, but Collins gives such a fresh spin that it feels brand new.  It was obvious to me that this author planned very carefully, not on just the character arc in this novel, but the overall arc in the next two.  The universal themes are what I believe will make these books timeless, and future classics. This is the reason they have been so successful, because you root for the characters despite overwhelming odds, because the characters can't stay the same after horrifying circumstances and so you learn and grow and ache with and for them. Isn't that the whole reason we read anyway? They are fast-paced, and I could not put them down. Though I thought the movie was very well done, and followed the plot closely, the books are better. I understood a lot more after reading this one, things that were not as clear to me in the movie, though I think the film makers probably guessed that many of its moviegoers had read the books. Yes, the theme is disturbing, but it has to be to make a point, and yet the author never deliberately makes one. She allows the character's turmoil (inner and outer) to make it. And that is writing at its best.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a great read not only for teenagers but also for adults. On the surface, the book tells the story of Katniss Everdeen, a nature enthusiast teenager residing in the poverty stricken twelfth district of Panem. Each year in Panem, the repressive government located in the Capitol organizes the Hunger Games in order to remind all of the districts of the uprising caused by the former thirteenth district. In celebration of the Hunger Games, the Capitol randomly selects one male and one female tribute from each of the twelve districts to fight it out to the death, with the winner being treated to riches and fame. At the Reaping, Prim, Katniss' younger sister, is chosen to serve as tribute. Without hesitation, Katniss instinctively volunteers as tribute and sacrifices her life for Prim's. Collins follows Katniss' journey to the Capitol in her mission to survive the Hunger Games.  Collins' plot twists throughout the story keep the book interesting and the reader on edge. Additionally, she uses the perfect combination of realism and fantasy to keep the story exciting but relatable. As thrilling as the story is, the content may not be suitable for children of all ages. There are some scenes with vivid description of violence. While this adds to the effect the story has on the reader, it may be upsetting for younger children.  Young adults aren't the only ones who can enjoy reading this book. Collins cleverly laces deeper meanings within each action that makes it an interesting read for adults as well. With each action packed scene of tributes slaughtering each other or actions of self-sacrifice comes an overarching message of altruism, repressive government, socioeconomic inequality, self-survival, and feminism. Collins does a brilliant job crafting each scene to invoke reflection and analysis, making it an enjoyable read for all.
A gripping, grim, and excellent read. It's a terrible bedtime book - it was so suspenseful I had trouble putting it down and turning out the light, then once I had the tension kept me awake.  Although not entirely unpredictable - I foresaw some version of the climactic scene at the end of the Hunger Games way in advance - the plot certainly took turns I did not expect.  I put off reading this book for quite awhile despite recommendations from colleagues because of the subject matter, but the book is written in such a way that the Games were more palatable than I expected.  I would have liked a little more meat to the main male character Peeta - perhaps that will come in the next book - but the main female character Katniss is admirable and interesting. I will be starting the second book as soon as I can get my hands on it!  ***  ADDED AFTER I FINISHED THE TRILOGY:  As a librarian, I like to read books that readers are talking about. As the leader of the librarys Movie of the Book club, I also keep an eye on books being made into movies. The Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins falls into both of these categories  a movie based on the first book is scheduled to be released in 2012  and I finally made it a priority to read it.  The Hunger Games has a horrific premise. A future version of the United States, Panem, damaged by war and climate change, hosts a yearly event called the Hunger Games. To punish its twelve Districts for rising up against the Capitol (and losing) decades earlier, two young adults from each District are chosen by lottery every year and sent to the Capitol to fight to the death in an arena while the whole country watches on television. One victor emerges.  Because of the depressing plot, I dragged my feet on reading the series. However, once I started I found it hard to stop. The three books in the trilogy are difficult to take. They are grim, violent, and disturbing. However, they are also exciting, full of unexpected plot twists, and told by a flawed and compelling narrator.  The first book in the series is The Hunger Games. It is the strongest book in the series. It grips your imagination and wont let go. It begins with an introduction to Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen-year-old who lives in District 12 with her mother, her little sister, and her sisters pet Buttercup, the worlds ugliest cat. Katnisss life is a hard one: never having enough to eat, hunting illegally to get food, scrambling to survive. Still, she has family and good friends.  But its reaping day, the day two youths in each District are chosen as tributes and sent to the Capitol to entertain its citizens by fighting to the death in punishment for rebellion. When her sisters name is chosen, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Then the boy for District 12 is chosen. He is Peeta Mellark, a boy in her class at school, a boy she is not friends with but owes a debt to all the same. And from that point on, their fates are intertwined as they head to the Capitol and the Hunger Games.  The similarity to our own reality television shows is obvious and no doubt intentional. The 24 contestants are polished and prepped, then presented to the viewers to choose favorites. While the cameras roll there are breathless interviews, the revealing of secrets, and prurient interest in the lives of the contestants. And then the Games begin.  Most of the first book takes place during the Games. The author makes you feel the narrators desperate desire to live. She also makes you feel the moral dilemma Katniss faces in knowing that to survive, every other contestant, including her fellow tribute from District 12, must die. The book made my heart race and gave me nightmares, but it also made me desperate to know what happened next. Although it concludes in a satisfactory manner, it is clearly a Book One that urges you to continue on to Book Two, Catching Fire.  As so often happens with a series, Catching Fire is not as good as the first book in the series. The novelty of the plot has worn off, but the pain and horror of the situation in Panem for the citizens of the Districts has not.  Thats not to say its not a good book. It is, and it continued to take plot turns I did not expect. There was no doubt I felt compelled at the end to forge on to Mockingjay, the final book in the series. Katniss continues to grow and change, as do the people and the situations around her, leading to a difficult but acceptable series conclusion that left me thinking about conditions in our own world. The themes of this series will stick with me for a long time.
This is the best book I read this year. Two thumbs up! Highly recommended. Why? Combine "Battle Royale" with teen dramas on the WB (with a little "The Running Man" thrown in) and watch the awesome. I've never seen a novel with a stronger beginning - the environment and backstory is established immediately, there's tension from page one, and the story has started before the end of the chapter. You've got a doomsday clock going, high stakes, and not much thinking. And the whole story is totally relatable to high school - I'd almost call it allegorical.  The story's composed in three parts. The first part is where we see our main character, a teen called Katniss living life in the slummy District 13, where starvation and poverty is standard fare. Part two occurs after she's chosen to participate in the District Games, which is essentially Battle Royale minus the backpack &amp; collars and plus the rivalry, because whoever wins gets set for life (although evidence suggests you never live down the scars). This part is where my "The Running Man" reference comes from, because we see the pre-interviews, the training, and the media circus surrounding this young girl. It's where the high school allegory shines brightest.  First people judge you on your appearance. Then you're judged on your chance for survival and given a score, but not told the criteria on which they judge you (may this be like the elite clique giving you your place in the world?). Then you give an interview, but it's Hollywood hype - it's giving people a personality they want to see. Some play the psycho tough, others play the cunning fox. You see, the purpose of this media circus is to get people to like you.  If they like you, they might buy you something during the games - food or weapons or medicine. So you've got to get yourself a personality, an image, and suck up to those fans. And it tears Katniss up because it's the opposite of what she is, a hard-working, bitter hunter from the coal-mining district. Now she has to be a dizzy damsel in unrequited love with her district partner. You can never be yourself in this game.  But here the initial inertia fades as the anticipation of the battle seeps through every word. Flashbacks to her life in District 13 try to build her character and romantic tension between her friend and her District partner (who she may have to kill at some point). There's a great deal of her thinking on this, on the consequences of her actions, and what this means to her survival and future relationships. It's not really a problem, because you always want to see what happens next, but it feels like padding.  Then we get to part three - the battle. Here it gets really introspective, because Katniss is on her own, clinging to the trees and looking for food, as she tries to play both the battle game and the media game (the audience is watching her every move, and could decide whether she lives or dies). It unfolds realistically, which is sort of the trapping of this story. Katniss does a lot of wandering, a lot of thinking, a lot of worrying. That's what you'd expect, but it doesn't move the plot much. You find yourself hoping to get to the end of the chapter, where you know something interesting is going to happen. But something interesting always happens. And you watch her alliances and enemies and actions have dire consequences as the plot moves along, and all Katniss wants to do is get out alive, compromising her values and hurting people as she does it.  Then some mutant dogs made out of dead competitors attack them.  Ahem.  All in all, this is a definite must-read. I'm sure someday we'll recognize Suzanne Collins and Scott Westerfeld as the mother and father of modern YA science-fiction.
While I enjoyed Suzanne Collins The Hunger Games (Book 1) immensely, it is not without flaws, some of them troubling. The writing is somewhat uneven, becoming overly sentimental at times, and Katniss sometimes is prone to judge too quickly and to act precipitately, without due reflection. She can, at times, be even petulant and childish. But these flaws do not affect the pace of the action, which is both logical, given the novels circumstances, and as implacable as the plot of Goldings modern classic, Lord of the Flies.  The Hunger Games is fast-paced (for the most part) and will appeal to a wide audience and range of ages. Like many adults who read Young Adult (YA) Fiction, I find many of the YA classics to be quite as well-written (if not better) than more mainstream adult novels. The book cannot, however, be dismissed as simply an action novel, since it can be read on different levels of sophistication. On reflection, it seems to fit nicely into the category of dystopian novels that have become familiar recently, particularly with Cormac McCarthys The Road, Richard Mathiesons I am Legend, their film reincarnations, and the interest they have renewed in science-fiction and dystopian fiction.  Is the book, which at first glance is a young adult novel, a typical example of dystopian fiction? If it is, what elements does it share with George Orwells 1984, Pat Franks Alas, Babylon, or even Shirley Jacksons classic short story, The Lottery (from which I suppose Collins got her subject)? Certainly the theme of fighters forced into mortal combat in an arena for the entertainment of the onlookers (who are superior in some way to the combatants) is as old as the Roman Gladiators and a staple of 1950s and 60s science fiction from Star Trek to Doctor Who. The associated theme that the viewers, however technically advance, are ultimately less civilized than the people who fight in the arena is also evident in the novel. (Some of the people in the Capitol even take noble Roman names: Cinna, Caesar, Venia, Flavius, Portia, and Octavia; and these names are obviously meant as an ironic comment on their lack of nobility. Of the people of the Capitol, only Cinna, her dress designer, is respected by Katniss.)  So, while its themes are not new, the novel does present in its relatively small scope of 384 pages a kaleidoscope of different subjects and themes. Overall, the theme of appearance vs. reality, a mainstay of 1960s literature and film, is handled skillfully, if at times a bit too obviously. What we perceive as objective reality we, like Katniss and Peeta, act upon; but are they (or we) always objective? Perception is subject to the prejudice and assumptions of the observer. Certainly the world of corporate Public Relations, popular entertainment, propaganda of all sorts, and their influence on the masses are justly criticized in the unfeeling people of the Capitol who, when compared with the people of the Divisions, appear hopelessly shallow, gullible, and easily manipulated.  Those in charge of Panem are fascists; they are the puppet-masters who hold all of the aces in the card game; they alone must answer only to themselves or to a few highly placed demagogues like President Snow, and rarely to the people of the Capitol. Those masses in the Divisions are less than human and apparently count for little other than forced labor; they are essentially automatons who perform certain manual chores that allow those privileged the leisure to follow other pursuits, and the Hunger Games themselves are a nasty form of perpetual punishment for an original but long passed disobedience.  Certainly the novel is open to many interpretations, and should therefore be an excellent book for classroom discussion. What, for example, does the novel say about the society of today? Is the world of the Hunger Games that different from ours? Is the author making a statement about our being centrally governed from a distant Capitol? Is she a Libertarian, wanting less big government and a movement toward states rights?  How much individual freedom do we really have? Are we in a democracy truly free? Is the author an apologist for the so-called welfare state, fearing that without that social net people might starve to death during an economic recession? Is the novel a comment on the draft of the 1960s? Considering such questions will enrich any discussion of the novel; and similar questions can also be presented on a more simplistic framework for younger readers.  The novels strengths are many, but it may strive to accomplish too much. Because the novel is the first part of a trilogy, its ending is somewhat unsatisfactory in that it concludes nothing and keeps us wondering, will Katniss ever find out who she really is? Will she become (as psychologist C. G. Jung termed it) individuated (psychologically mature)? But, since the book is the first in a series, its promise of more to come is welcome. Ultimately, Collins has created in Katniss a heroine with many foibles, who is often thick-headed and at times slow to realize the obvious. But, more importantly, she is a girl being transformed into a woman by the force of circumstances. She is forced to grow up in a world that is often savage and uncaring, where the victors are too often also the losers. We come to care about this girl and her world, and to believe in the justness and nobility of her quest; and that is the ultimate praise a reader can give any author.
And may the odds be ever in your favor. When I first heard of the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, half of my family were already reading the last book, and I was more than once accosted to see if I was reading it yet. I began my journey through Panem shortly afterward. I was surprised that it was such an easy book to get into with a female protagonist which I was not entirely familiar with. I have read a few books like it, but it was a little different that what I would typically read. I was impressed with the character descriptions, and the action of the book. The book follows Katniss Everdeen, a young girl from district 12 in Panem, a post United States dictatorship. She volunteers to take her sisters place in a tournament to the death in which the 12 districts send a male and female to participate. It goes through her struggle for survival, and how she makes some unlikely allies who later become very important in her life. I did feel that there were times when it was a little slower than I thought a death tournament would be like. There are some graphic depictions of death in this book series, which I would not recommend for younger teens who may not be familiar with such things. The news is one thing, but having those images conjured up in ones head might be a little too much. I did appreciate the dynamic between Katniss and Peeta. I thought it was refreshing and contrasted well with the world in which they lived. It was heart wrenching to see Katniss intervene at the reaping on behalf of her sister. I would recommend this book for reading aloud with your family with older teens. For a young adult book, I did not feel that the vocabulary was very challenging, which I think should be a focus for this age group. Overall, I liked the series, and I re-read them with my family when we are in the mood for something familiar, but not overly challenging.
Once upon a time in the not-too-near future, the United States lies in ruins, and in its place is Panem, with a glittering Capitol City at its center and 12 outlying districts supplying the City's needs. Life in the districts is hard, and nowhere is it harder than in District 12, where 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen lives with her widowed mother and little sister Prim.  All Katniss wants to do is provide for her family, and so she hunts illegally in the forest outside the district fence. She works tirelessly and lives in fear each day of being caught and punished. But, more than being caught poaching, she fears being chosen for the Hunger Games, a mandatory annual competition in which 24 teenagers, one boy and one girl from each district, are selected to fight to the death on national television.  Outwit, Outplay, Outlast, my Aunt Fanny: Survivor ain't got nothin' on the Hunger Games.  When 12-year-old Prim's name is pulled from the box, however, Katniss volunteers to go as tribute in her place. She and the other tribute, baker's son Peeta, travel to Capitol City to take their place in the arena, and face what is likely certain death for both of them. Their mentor, Haymitch, the only winner District 12 has ever produced, has other ideas. And an unlikely strategy that just might give them an edge.  But the rules state that there can be only one winner. Victory. Or death. Those are the only options. Because she's our heroine, we know going in that Katniss must come out the victor, but how she gets to the winner's circle is a harrowing, fretful journey indeed. And one entirely worth taking along with her.  I started The Hunger Games on a Friday evening and finished it the next day by mid-afternoon. I can hardly wait to start the next book.
I loved this book. Though some bits of it were not the most well done, I could not help but caught up in the story and the world.  Im a sucker for dystopian or post-apocalyptic worlds, and if they are done well, which it is here, its just knocks my socks off. The world of the differently struggling and functioning districts controlled by this all mighty Capitol was really interesting. There were some really good little details added to the story about them as well, like how they each had their own style of bread that represented each of them. I also liked the idea of mutated animals to serve a certain purpose.  You don't get to really meet many characters throughout the book very well, but I liked what I did get to know about each. Of course because the book is from her perspective, you got to know Katniss pretty well. At first she is pretty much described as someone who has it all together because she had to, because she had to grow up too quickly. But you also see cracks in the shell, which I thought was a nice change. While I believe that a girl in her situation could have it all together and be an adult in a younger body, but then I can also see how a girl in her situation could appear completely with it but have moments where the teenager comes through, specially if she has pretty much been handed a death sentence. For the most part she has it all, but then there are moments where she does teenage tantrums and breaks a punch of stuff. I do however that she was a bit too much of an ice queen the rest of the time though. I didn't really get the feeling that she cared about anything, however I think this had more to do with the writing style however than the character, she did and said a lot of the right stuff, but I just wasnt getting the feelings behind it all. I also thought that she thought too much sometimes. There were parts where I felt that too much information was given that really wasnt given.  Peeta I thought we got a really good look at the kind of person he was, and at the end when they are going home and Katniss is being really a typical confused teenager, I really got the feeling of how crushed he was that everything he thought was actually happening was just a ploy to get them through the games. And even though we did not get to spend a lot of time with Gale, I also felt I know who he is and what he wants. Really, the love triangle that I see coming is one that I dont know how I want it to end up. On one hand Peeta and Katniss share a moment from when she was little and they have had a life altering experience together. On the other we have Gale who has has grown up with and shared many a moment together, though not nearly as significant as being in the games together.  The other characters I felt I met them well enough, but I would have been happier if I had gotten to know a few of them better. I also would have liked to be given other perspectives at some points. Like for the Capitol, what the hell was going on there, what were they thinking? I kind of felt that I was in a black box and new nothing about the people who put me in there or what was on the other side. Im hoping for more information in the next two books.  So all in all I thought the theme, plot and the character were all well done, however the writing style was a bit flat and lacking depth at times.
n analytical review of The Hunger Games?...I can not believe I am doing this. "Why?" you say. Well for starters I re-read The Hunger Games because it was a part of my class readings. I know how awesome is that? Greatest class in the world! But, you can analyze the crap out of this book. I'm pretty sure we kept finding out new things about The Hunger Games every single class. Every. Single. Class. So, if I end up missing something please forgive me. I actually wrote a three page paper on it. It was pretty awesome. Now, this review isn't going to be anything special...hell its probably going to be long enough that I'm not going to review it. Sorry, but it is what it is and I hope that you come to see the similarities and references that I saw.  In The Hunger Games Suzanne Collins creates a culture that emphasizes the diseased and negative aspects of our current culture by making references to not only our present, but our past. She depicts our obsession with fashion and popular culture through the capital, and our love for "real" fighting through The Hunger Games themselves. The Hunger Games allude to both our past and our present. It reflects out love of live fights but incorporates it with our past; mainly, the Hunger Games alludes to the original Olympics, the time of the Gladiators, and the time of Greek and Roman culture.  Instead of grown men fighting for a way to pay their debts or attempting to remove the shackles of slavery we are introduces to a world were children fight to the death for glory or survival. But, its not them who owes a debt; it's the whole of Panem. Who do they owe the debt to? A dictator...the capital and specifically President Snow. And here is where more greek and roman mythology comes into the story. The children becomes sacrifices...but there is no mention of gods in this story. So the government/ President Snow becomes the god. The sacrifice of children (the innocent) are being made to him and the capital. President Snow isn't the only god that the children should be afraid of. The majority of the novel takes place in a world inside of a world. Specifically the arena. In there the children are led to believe that they have control over their fate (the strongest will survive), but they don't. They aren't in charge of their world. Their world is manipulated by the Game Makers through the use of fire balls, and the ability to give and take water; they have becomes the gods of their world.  Then there is Katniss herself. She can be seen as the goddess Artemis. While relating to Artemis mainly through her hunting skills with a bow and arrow Katniss also finds herself more comfortable in the wilderness, at ease with the animals, a protector of young girls (all things Artemis is goddess of). Oh and did I mention Artemis is mainly depicted with a braid? Usually rolled up into a bun, but still...you can see the similarities right?  Not enough?  How about we get back to the sacrifice thing? Alright...during the time when Greek and Roman culture was at its peek a simply offence like stealing could land you the death penality; however, the least severe punishment was the loss of a limb. Can you see where I am going? Katniss and Peeta stole something from the gods/the Game Makers. They stole power. The beat them at their own game...so their punishment? A loss of limb. Now, of course, Katniss is the main character of our book and couldn't very well be punished like that...but Peeta? The truly innocent person of the two paid the price and lost his leg.  And, what I think is the cherry on top, the beasts at the end of the games. They were creatures created by the gods/Game makers to do their bidding...but, their partially human. In Greek mythology(maybe Roman. I can't recall 100%) the gods were famous for manipulating humans. The story of the minotaur comes to mind. The minotaur is half-human half bull created when the gods cast a spell on a queen as revenge and made her fall in love with a bull. The creature was later placed in the labyrinth to kill anyhow who believed they could make it through safely.  That's enough about Greek and Roman culture lets look at the capital, which is a reference to our culture state of culture.. The capital is filled with people wanting to be individuals, but ending up all being the same. They are greedy, frivolous, and materialistic. They wish for the best of the best, and from what we read, barely have to do anything to get it. They see others suffering and the deaths of others as entertainment. They like their mahogany, their different wigs daily, their brights colours, their silver handles, and the best food money can buy. But, the biggest connection I saw is how they WORSHIP the winners and the tributes. The tributes and, more specifically, the winners become celebrities. People begin to wear their hair like Katniss'. They wish to follow their every move and can't get enough of the star-crossed lovers of District 12. Collins reflects on our society's need to know about celebrities and almost become them or feel like they are apart of our lives.  Now, lets look more specifically at Katniss. Katniss can be analyzed for quite sometime, but I'll shorten it up for you. Katniss is de-feminized in the book. This is done to help bridge the gap to other readers (of the male variety). She is also the `adult' in her family and has been for some time....this too bridges the gap to older audiences. Then there is the fact that she becomes emotionless and seen more as intellectual...to a fault. I'm not sure if this reflects on our society...it probably does. I mean more people care about their technology and becoming more powerful these days than they do about the innocent people who lose their jobs and have to go to a soup kitchen daily. Or how about even just the children of third world countries? Anyhow, Katniss is against the games and the worship of the winner, but when it comes down to it she manipulates anyone and anything to become a winner (don't get me wrong after she becomes friends with Rue she does start to become more emotional), but after the games she becomes the very thing she hates: she becomes a celebrity. She plays nice for the cameras to survive and to keep those she loves alive, even though her actions bring other innocence into harms way. She is, after all, the catalyst for what happens in the second novel. Katniss is so messed up shes doesn't believe in kindness. She believes in the greediness and selfishness of society to the point where she cannot recognize, nor determine, Peeta's kindness. She thinks everything he does is strategy. She even sees Gale as a friend, but as a great hunting party who aids in her hunting and she in his. They are mutually beneficial to each other.  I'm not bashing on Katniss, because even though she is abrasive I still actually like her. See Katniss also represents the part of our society were kids have to grow up sooner than they should. Katniss barely ever had a childhood, she was always the adult, and the entire time she is doing what she thinks is best for herself and her more importantly...her family. In fact is should be noted and really observed that they a CHILDREN going into the games. Even though the hack each others heads off and set traps they are all children...even Cato recognizes that at the end. So why children? Well...if you are a parent or were or might be what would be your biggest fear? What would you do anything for? You kids, right? So if the government told you to do what they say...to comply or your kids will be sacrificed you would probably do it. They story wouldn't have the same ring to it if it were adults, the story plays on a parent's greatest fear...maybe even society's greatest fear in general: the sacrifice of innocence and our youth. Its something that happens every day. Kids have sex young, have babies, and even join gangs, instead of going to concerts, hanging with their friends, or, god forbid, doing their homework.  Now, lets look at Panem as a whole. We are informed that Panem is the remains of North America. Panam is....the world in this book. But, do we ever hear about the actual rest of the world? Nope. Wanna know why? Because we North Americans generally believe that the world revolves around us. Some of us think that North America is the world. We have fortune 500 companies, the majority of billionaires, and the largest imports and exports. Sadly, we have a pretty big say in the politics of the world. Sorry if people disagree with me, and I'm not saying I'm right... I'm just saying the novel plays on that idea of our society.  To be honest out of this entire novel the most unrealistic thing, to me, is Peeta. How does someone like him even get created in a world like this? He's parents are awful (specifically his mom, but I don't exactly see his dad doing anything for him either), he's not poor but not rich, his brothers obviously don't love him enough to sacrifice themselves for him, and the girl he loves never really knew his name, and is using him. Oh, and he looses a leg! The fact that he gets out of bed every day a nice guy seriously amazes me. Maybe his mother inadvertently humble him while beating him with burnt bread?  And how about Haymitch...he's a drunk. That is the cure for PTSD apparently. Did you know that in the last decade the government, in both Canada and the U.S, wanted to cut back on the treatment offers for not only soldiers, but other suffering from mental disorders? Now, I'm not saying that the book references that the government doesn't care about it soldiers, but many people don't understand how to cope with things like that and simple turn to drinking. It also references substance abuse in general.  Some other quick things:  There are districts= the seperation of the masses to prevent uprising  There is a clear definition of hierarchy, and the rich and the poor. Simply being born into a richer district gives you better odds  Oh...and the whole "May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor"... obviously everyone gets thats a big joke, because the odds are actually against them.  Genetic manipulation=  On a lighter note: this book rocks my world. There is adventure, romance, suspense, and a cliff-hanger of sorts. It blows my mind away how it can be read simply as an adventure, but can also be dissected down to its word usage.  There is so much more, but my brain currently hurts just thinking about it, and I can't exactly copy and past my essay here...my University would not like that. But for those of you that always said you don't like The Hunger Games you should re-read it with the idea of dissecting it and I bet you'd be amazed at what you find. I'm not saying you'll enjoy it because its just not for some people, and I'm not saying shame on your for not liking it because...really, what business is it of mine? And, to each their own! I'm just happy that you're reading in general lol.  If there is anything else that you can think of please feel free to comment or shoot me an email...I would love discussing this book (or others) with other people.  Good:  The story line-- It hits on our corrupt and diseased society that is obsessed with TV, `real' fighting, and the lives of celebrities.  The characters--they are extremely well crafted  Bad:  I honestly cannot think of anything.  Overall (Writing style, story line, and general):  Overall I think its a brilliant read whether your reading it for the adventure, the romance, or for school. I loved the constantly moving plot. I love the difficult to understand Katniss, the can't help but fall in love with Peeta, and the unforgetable (and we feel sorry for him) Gale. I found it extremely easy to follow and I had no difficulties remembering people or recalling information previously given at the beginning of the book. And yes I'll admit it I loved the rush that you get when reading about the deaths and the games!  And dear lord how I am in love with The Boy With the Bread.  In relation to the movie:  Many people said they didn't like the movie. Hey to each their own. I personally loved it. I found that it followed the book pretty well. Now it wasn't perfect...sorry but fitting two weeks prior to the games and the two-three weeks of the games in a two hour movie just can't happen. Did I miss the connection that you could really feel in the book between Katniss and Peeta? Ya I did. But, hey I could still feel it in the movie too, just not as big. Cato was pretty devious in the movie just like in the book, same with Clove and Glimmer. I will tell you the one things I really missed:  Right after the announcement about their being allowed two victors Katniss says Peeta's name. In the book she shouts it. When I read that part...I cried. It added to their whole star-crossed lovers thing, but in the movie it wasn't loud enough for me. I wanted her to shout it and then be afraid that she was too loud.  Oh an I expected Peeta to be ripped. Like Kellan Lutz or something.
I had few preconceived notions about "The Hunger Games" when I started reading it because I'd managed to avoid a lot of the hype that surrounds popular books. (I know: Figure that one out.) Most of the details I'd come by had been related by a friend, who said the book was interesting and worth reading. She was right on both counts and I did enjoy it.  However, it wasn't the ubertome I'd expected from what buildup I'd been exposed to. The plot is engaging enough, but I kept finding myself thinking of Stephen King's "The Running Man," with a little bit of "Logan's Run" thrown in for good measure. When I tried to put my finger on why I felt that way, I concluded that the book had originality but didn't quite manage to break the mold of dystopian commonplace.  The main thing that kept me from being unequivocally enthusiastic about the book is this: I didn't find it believable that the people of Panem accept their fate unquestioningly, behaving uniformly like sheep patiently awaiting their turn in the abattoir. They have the ability to get outside the Seam's electrified enclosure and flee their prison because the electricity rarely works and there's a hole in the fence. Why in the world don't they take advantage of it and escape the district? There are no armed forces keeping the residents in check, no tracking devices on the citizens of the districts. Anyone with a modicum of sense wouldn't hang around long enough to undergo the reaping and chance being forced into the Hunger Games, or watch their loved ones be slaughtered in them, or expose their children to that risk. Gale actually suggests leaving, but Katniss thinks the idea is preposterous. We're never told why it's such an outrageous proposition, however. It seems as though she should jump at the chance because her little sister, whom she loves very much, is now eligible for the reaping.  If you're fond of dystopian tales or simply a likeable story, you'll enjoy this book. It was entertaining and at times engrossing, and I plan to read the rest of the series.  I was surprised by the careless editing. The Scholastic imprint used to mean that the book it graced would be well edited, with hardly an error. Not any longer. Examples of the many mistakes include subjunctives ("Better he does [do] it in the woods"), word choice ("skinny arms around me like a vice [vise]"; "I hear the anthem that proceeds [precedes] the death recap"; "the others will be honing [homing] in"; "trying to staunch [stanch] the flow"), verb inflection ("the front bakery bell rung [rang]"), comma splices ("I have Peeta to clutch for balance, he is so steady"), and spelling ("the blood bath [bloodbath] at the"). The number of errors was jarring but not enough to ruin the book for those who pay attention to such things.
Collins pens a heart-pounding page turner with "The Hunger Games." Set in the future, a war has changed the makeup of North America. Now called Panem, the area is spilt into 12 Districts and is governed by a capital in the former state of Colorado. Every year, to remind the districts they are the "losers" in the war, the Capital stages "The Hunger Games." Districts select tributes to represent them. The tributes must kill each other in a game arena to win.  When Katniss Everdeen's sister, Prim, is selected to represent District 12, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Along with Peeta Mellark, Katniss travels to the Capital. As she prepares to participate in the games, she realizes there is more to the games than skill. She must learn the art of subtlety and draw on all her wits to keep alive. Can Katniss win "The Hunger Games?"  Collins' writing is crisp and sharp. She never lingers - the pacing is perfect. Her descriptions are just enough to paint vivid pictures in the reader's mind. Collins' creativity and imagination shine in this story as she gives us a dystopian look at the future, and while the future may look bleak, she also leaves us with a smidgen of hope.  The best part of the novel is the journey Katniss makes. When the reader meets her, they learn she is physically strong, but it's the emotional journey that allows her to grow. Katniss' heart is as tough as nails, but to survive, she must show a tender side. She must demonstrate she cares for Peeta or she will lose. Can Katniss allow herself to explore the vulnerabilities of the human heart while playing the most dangerous game of her life?  The book is mainstream fiction and appeals to readers 10 and up. The Hunger Games will keep you on the edge of your seat, anxious to find out what will happen next. I highly recommend this book.
I READ THE HUNGER GAMES TWO YEARS AGO AND NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO WRITE A REVIEW. I WASN'T ONE OF THE EARLIEST FANS BUT I READ THE BOOK IN 2011 AND TO BE HONEST I WASN'T A BOOKS PERSON BACK THEN. BUT AFTER I READ THE HUNGER GAMES, I HAD THIS SUDDEN URGE TO READ MORE AND MORE OF ANYTHING. SO I ASKED MY FRIENDS ABOUT RECOMMENDATIONS, I WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND CHECKED THE INTERNET AND PRETTY SOON THERE WERENT MANY BOOKS LEFT THAT I HAVENT READ REALLY. HUNGER GAMES REALY GAVE ME THE LOVE OF READING. I REALLY LEARNED THE MEANING OF READING ONCE I READ THESE BOOKS. BEFORE THAT, I USED TO JUST SKIP OVER THE PAGES, FALL ASLEEP WHILE I READ BECAUSE I JUST COULD NOT FOCUS WHEN I KEPT THINKING OF OTHER THINGS, LIKE I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF READING WHEN I COULD JUST WATCH THE MOVIE OR GO OUT AND CHILL. WELL HUNGER GAMES PRETTY MUCH CHANGED THAT FOR ME. I REALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT A NARRATOR DOES TO A READER BECAUSE I CAN PUT MYSELF IN THEIR SHOES AND EMPATHIZE WITH THEM AND EXPERIENCE THEIR WOLRD AS IF IT WAS MY OWN LIFE. I THOUGHT ABOUT KATNISS IN MY HEAD AND IMAGINED MY SELF AS HER, EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY SIMILARITIES. BUT I THOUGHT ABOUT MYSELF AS HER AND THOUGHT WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF I HAD THIS LIFE? I GOT HOOKED IN SUPER EASILY AND FOCUSED QUICKLY TOO AND I JUST COULD NOT STOP READING. SO I READ THEM ALL IN THREE DAYS AND I READ THEM ALL AGAIN BECAUSE FIRST TIME I READ THEM I READ THEM SO FAST THAT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW I FINISHED IT. I HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING FASTER. SO I READ THEM ALL AGAIN. AND I TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THEM AND THEY WERE LIKE "YOU'RE SO OBSESSED!!" AND THEN I MADE SOME PEOPLE READ THEM AND SOME PEOPLE JUST DON'T LIKE READING SO THEY WERE LIKE "NO THANKS, I'M JUST GONNO WATCH THE MOVIE" AND I DON'T KLNOW WHAT TO TELL THOSE PEOPLE OTHER THAN THAT READING IS SOMETHING THAT GROWS IN YOU, IT'S NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT YOU TELL YOUR SELF ABOUT AND IT HAPPENS. AND BECAUSE I AM AN OBSESSED FAN I HAVE QUITE A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF THINGS RELATED TO THE HUNGER GAMES. I HAVE ALL THE BOOKS AND I ALSO HAVE A COPY OF THE FIRST BOOK IN MY NATIVE LANGUAGE WHICH IS TURKISH. I HAVE FOUR BOOKMARKS. I HAVE THIS MAGAZINE FROM THE EDITORS OF US AND I BOUGHT IT BEFORE THE MOVIE CAME OUT AND SAW LOTS OF SNEAK PEEKS WHICH WAS PRETTY DARN COOL. I AM OBSESSED WITH JOSH HUTCHERSON. HE IS JUST SO CUTE, I CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW MUCH HE FITS FOR THE ROLE AND HOW GLAD I WAS WHEN THEY CHOSE HIM AS PEETA. I WASN'T REALLY SURE ABOUT JENNIFER LAWRENCE FIRST BUT NOW I LIKE HER AND THE REST OF THE CAST IS ALSO AMAZING. I WAS ONLY SURPRIZED BY CINNA'S ACTOR BUT WHEN I READ THE BOOK AGAIN, I SAW THAT I MISSED IT, AND I IMAGINED HIM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN MY HEAD BUT IT'S OKAY, HE WAS STILL AWESOME, AND I FOLLOWED THE WHOLE CAST ON INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER AND I LOVED IT WHEN THEY POSTED PICTURES AND SNEAK PEEKS FROM BEHIND THE SCENES, I WAS SO THANKFUL. AND I POSTED SO MANY THINGS ON FACEBOOK ALL THE TIME, MY FRIENDS STARTED CALLING ME "HUNGER GAMES". I HAVE FOLDERS, AND PENS, I HAVE THE PIN, I HAVE A CARD NECKLASE, I HAVE A T-SHIRT, I HAVE TWO POSTERS, I HAVE A PIN NECKLASE, I HAVE A MOVIE TRIBUTE GUIDE. I AM ALSO TEAM PEETA BECAUSE HE IS SUPER SWEET AND HE HAS DONE A LOT MORE FOR KATNISS THAN GALE HAS DONE FOR HER. AND LASTLY I WANT TO THANK SUZANNE COLLINS, YOU CHANGED MY WORLD. YOU GAVE ME THE LOVE OF READING, AND AFTER READING THE HUNGER GAMES I READ HUSH HUSH, THE MORTAL INSTRUMENTS, FALLEN, GALLAGHER GIRLS, BEAUTIFUL CREATURES, SHIVER, WINGS, DELIRIUM, DIVERGENT, PERCY JACKSON AND MANY MORE BOOKS. AND NOT ALL OF THEM ARE POPULAR BUT THEY WERE USUALY BEST SELLERS. I USUALLY GET OBSESSED WITH ALL THE BOOKS I READ, ITS THE LEVEL OF OBSESSION THAT MAKES ME LOVE THEM, AND I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU READ THESE BOOKS, I HOPE THAT YOU DON'T JUST WATCH THE MOVIE, ITS NOT THE SAME EXPERIENCE. SO READ THE BOOK, WATCH THE MOVIE, TEL PEOPLE ABOUT IT, BUY SOME STUFF, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM JUST COMMENT BELOW AND TELL ME ABOUT IT, AND I MIGHT UNDERSTAND. BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU WON'T REGRET IT. :)
Perhaps one of the most powerful ideas in this book is the idea of defiance, of standing up to those who mean you harm. That is the spirit that Katniss Everdeen embodies. She is the big sister that puts her own life on the line so that her sister, Primrose, does not need to fight in the dreaded Hunger Games.  There are many out there who lambaste Collins for seemingly copy-and-pasting "Battle Royale" word for word, but there are enough differences between the two for this book not to be blatant copy, perhaps merely another author's rendition of a similar source work. Of course, the purpose of this review is not to compare two books side-by-side, but to review Suzanne Collins's "The Hunger Games" as a standalone novel.  The premise is simple. Every year twelve districts all around the totalitarian country of Panem must send one boy and one girl as "Tributes" into the Hunger Games, a contest between the districts that awards the winning district with fame and glory and lots and lots of resources from the government. What an excellent concept this is, from a political standpoint. It keeps the upper class citizens of Panem, who reside at the capital, happy and entertained, while the bottom of the pyramid, the Districts, fight against each other, making a full-blown rebellion all but impossible. Of course, this year's Games is not like any of the other games. There can be only one victor, but it is Katniss's defiant spirit that causes the greatest upset to the games Panem has ever seen.  As a first-person limited novel, much of the history of Collins's world is left to conjecture. Katniss is a strong observer, but not an omniscient one, not by a long shot. She can only provide her own guesses, which we adopt and add to, as to what is happening outside of the Games that she is currently participating in. However, the strength of this perspective lies in giving us, the readers, unlimited access to the deepest recesses of Katniss's mind. We effectively become Katniss Everdeen, the defiant girl who started a spark of revolution throughout the nation.  The character development is good. We get to know not only Katniss, but also the characters she comes across. But perhaps it is Haymitch's character that steals the show. His attitude toward life, teetering between sarcastic scorn and PTSD, reflects the attitudes of some soldiers who return from combat. According to Collins, such is actually her source material for the characters and plot, the exploration of combat and its effects on young soldiers. As this is the first novel in the series, we still have yet to see any significant development of Gale and Peeta, both of whom remain rather static throughout the novel. Peeta starts off weak, he ends off weak, getting wounded and hiding in the mud as opposed to Katniss, who becomes a huntress of people.  The plot and pacing are good, though it's a little slow for the first third of the book. Collins uses this first part to develop the main backstory of Panem, dedicating the latter half to the actual Games itself. Once we step into the arena, however, it's no holds barred and everything you've ever known just flies out the window.  This is by no means a thorough review of the novel. I have only read it once and that was over a year ago, so I'm going on very shallow memory right now. Overall, it is an enjoyable novel, the start of something that could have been, but failed to launch with Mockingjay.
When I watched the movie version of "The Hunger Games" I was captivated--and disturbed--by its intense and compelling storyline. And when I found out I could get the book on loan for free on my Kindle through my amazon.com Prime account, I couldn't resist. The book does not disappoint. It is every bit as riveting as the movie. An interesting feature of the book is its first person narrative by the main character, Katniss Everdeen. This approach allows us to see into her head, so to speak, to discern the thoughts and emotions that accompany her actions and interactions.  The movie, as it turns out, was very faithful to the book. The harmony between the two was almost seamless. But what was truly delightful about seeing the movie and reading the book is how they added to, and enriched, each other. Book + Movie = 2 + 2 = 5. The book fills in a lot of the background and context of the events in the movie. The book also includes some details that enrich our understanding and appreciation of the characters. The movie, of course, adds a fascinating visual component to the story. Characters from the book literally come to life on the big screen, which in its artistic excellence, draws the viewer into the drama with a sometimes disturbing intensity!  The only real difference I saw between the book and the movie was their respective endings. The movie seemed to be more complete in its ending, leaving one with the sense of a satisfying conclusion. The book, on the other hand, masterfully left many loose ends untied--not in a way that left the reader frustrated, but with a desire to read more. And urgently so! The sequel ("Catching Fire") is now definitely on my "must-read" list.  "The Hunger Games." If you have watched the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book. If you have read the book, do yourself a favor and watch the movie. You won't be disappointed.
Wow, the premise of this book is genius, but also disturbing on many levels. Several of my 4th grade students have read this book but they don't understand why the book's themes are so shocking to me-maybe they lack historical context or maybe they're just so used to seeing violence on TV and in video games.  *I see analogies to Hitler's Germany with the use of hunger and food to control the districts (who are essentially prisoners of war). Katniss notes that there are not many old people in her district and many starve to death. Of course, they can always get food and cooking supplies but at the extreme cost of putting their name in the games lottery.  *The contrast between the government and the district people is stark and scary. The gov't. population have all the luxuries that one can think of but have absolutely no social conscience about making kids fight to the death in front of them. It brings to mind the Christians thrown in the Roman colosseums to fight lions for the entertainment of the populace.  *The fact that Katniss has to stand naked in front of the male and female stylists (remember, she's only 16) to be inspected adds more horror to the people who run the games. The author doesn't portray this as a sexual act, but merely as how a farmer would inspect a cow or pig that he intends to buy and butcher. However, Katniss also notes that several tributes have been brought out for their TV introduction nude or semi-nude (Katniss hopes that her stylists don't do this to her).  *I can't think of any other book I've read where kids (aged 12-18) have to fight and kill each other. I suppose we're used to reading about adults fighting and killing but not children!  *Unfortunately, I saw the movie before I read the book. There's so much information in the book that's not in the movie, like how Katniss got her name and how she got the mockingjay badge (and its significance). I will read the other two books in the series before seeing the movies. I can't wait to see the gov't. get its due at the hand of the districts (at least this is what I suspect will happen).  I highly recommend this book but probably not for kids less than 16 years old. And I would suggest discussing it afterwards.  I wouldn't take a star away but I will say that it's strange to read a book like this written in the present tense. I can't remember the last time I read a novel not written in past tense...
WOW. I'm a bit floored by this strong first book in the series. I never wanted to read this or even watch the movie on the premiss I thought it was a story about how they made kids compete and kill each other and the dead corpses of those children that didn't make it were then turned into a food source for others. Some of you may laugh by this admission but its true. Just how my mind works I guess. I have a wild imagination. Guess that's why I love to write my own stories. I digress. I couldnt have been more wrong. Anyway after breaking down a few months ago and watching the movie I was hooked. At some point saying I should check out the books before the next movie comes out. Well I was hooked from the first page. It's a real page turner and the writing is solid. We are in Katniss Everdeen's head from day one. And my heart has been ready to jump from my chest ever since. She's brave, so brave and smart. Her solid tactics of survival make her so interesting. The way she see's the world is unique and fierce. And watching her fight for her right to live was amazing.  Things I hated, the fact that this story was based on children battling it out to the death in an ever changing arena wroght with dangers with ever step they took. That said, it was a very unique way of telling a story similar to Lord of the Flies in content. At times I couldn't decided if Katniss really liked Peeta or if it was all an act and so it had me feeling sorry for him at times.  What I loved: I am a big food connoisseur and the way Katniss described all the different food she ate made even squirrel sound like a delicious entree. Also the descriptions didn't weigh down the story but only helped build this intricate world filled with plastic faces and rough terrain and animals that seemed so imaginative I wonder where the author came up with some of these creatures.  Katniss sensibilities in hunting are a major factor in what keeps her alive in addition to her ability to climb trees and live in them until the Capitol gets involved. Or the Gamemakers I should say. Okay I've said enough. If you haven't read this book I suggest you add it to your reading list. You will not be disappointed. Oh, one more thing. The scenes of death of the kids during the course of the Hunger Games was not as bad as some had said. The details are not so bad as to make one turn away and not read this. At least I didn't think so and I can't watch horror movies because they give me nightmares.
In the future, North American has become the nation of Panem, ruled by the Capitol and separated into 12 districts. Past rebellion has caused the Capitol to become extreme in their methods of keeping the districts under control. To keep the districts in check, the Capitol instills fear in the districts by holding an annual "Hunger Games." In these games, one boy and one girl from each district (called "tributes") are sent to an arena where they must fight to the death. To make it worse, these events are broadcast on live TV.  Katniss Everdeen, who lives in district 12, is her family's provider because she breaks the rules and goes hunting. She is fiercely protective of her sister, Prim, so when Prim's name is called as a Hunger Games participant, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Katniss is immediately taken to the Capitol in preparation for the Hunger Games, along with the other 23 tributes. Will Katniss survive the Games?  If you work with young adults or are a fan of young adult literature, this book is practically required reading. I'd heard wonderful things about it, but I didn't pick it up until recently. It kept me up late at night because I couldn't. put. it. down. It is action-packed and you never know what will happen next. I thought that Collins developed the characters well, and I was really rooting for Katniss throughout the whole book. There was even a little element of romance in this book, despite the grim circumstances the characters find themselves in. If you want an exciting blend of adventure, romance, and suspense, read this book. To be honest, I was afraid the violence in this book would be a huge turnoff, but I was so engrossed in the story that they violence didn't ruin it for me.  The ending was a big surprise to me, and I couldn't wait to find out what happened to the characters next.  Luckily, this is the first book of a trilogy! I'm warning you - only pick up this book if you have time to finish it quickly. You will not want to put it down! Same goes for Catching Fire.
You can see my full review, as well as many others on my blog The Dancing Nerd Writes Again.  *I was required to read this book for my Literature and War class.  Initial Thoughts:  This was my second time reading The Hunger Games and after seeing the movie multiple times. I was very familiar with the work, but when I read it this time, through the eyes of a critical reader, the experience was extremely different. As a novel to read for pleasure, I found that I enjoyed the story much more than I did when I was required to read it for class and dissect the literary aspects of the characters and plot.  Spoilers!  I'm assuming anyone who wanted to read this book already has or has seen the movie so this section isn't going to discuss spoilers as much it is going to discuss the differences in the way I interpreted the novel the second time around.  One of the main things I disliked when reading the novel this time, was Katniss and Peeta's relationship. To be clear, I wasn't annoyed with how their relationship progresses in this novel, but having read the entire series I'm simply frustrated with the way I know their relationship will turn out. Throughout The Hunger Games Katniss repeatedly mentions that she doesn't want kids, doesn't want a relationship with Peeta or anyone, and yet it is forced upon her. I also think their relationship takes away from the overall message of the book, and depletes the integrity of the story. I felt like the relationship was only added to appease the targeted, young adult audience.  We discussed this aspect of the novel many times in class, and even though a few students argued for the relationship, saying that it was an interesting challenge Katniss had to overcome and deal with in order to survive, it still doesn't sit well with me. Again, I'm not as upset by the relationship displayed in this novel as I am with the ones in the later novels, but I'll leave that for another review.  Another thing that annoyed me while reading this time was realizing how much Collins `told' the reader instead of `showing' us. I felt like the book was dumbed down in some ways and that the author or publisher assumed the audience wouldn't be able to interpret or comprehend Katniss' actions, so she told us everything that was happening, instead of letting us come to our own conclusions.  I didn't mean for this review to turn into a rant, so I'll try and turn it around. The things I really enjoyed about the novel is the fact that I hate that I enjoyed it. By liking this book, I'm playing right into Collins trap and becoming no better than a member of the Capitol. I think it's amazing that this book, while showing us the horrors of the Capitol and of the Hunger Games, pulls us in and reverses the situation, making us, the consumers and readers and everyone who saw the movie, observers and willing audience members of...well, the Hunger Games. It's such a brilliant and existential concept that I'm having a hard time adequately explaining it, but hopefully you get what I'm hinting at.  Conclusion:  I'll openly admit that I enjoyed this book much more the first time, when I was 17 years old and reading it for fun. Picking it up again and reading it critically and analyzing every sentence, every plot twist or character motivation, has definitely given me a new and drastically different perspective.  I think what Collins was able to accomplish with this novel, and through the movie, is an amazing feat that leaves audience members and readers alike examining the world we live in and contemplating what could happen. I'm excited to go and reread the second and third book in the series before the movies come out, and wondering what I'll like or dislike about those novels after I've read them more critically.  Rating:4/5 stars
Let's be real, who really wants to read a story about children duking it out to the death? Not me-the thought actually freaks me out, and at the same time saddens me. Children are so innocent and kind, that the idea of giving them weapons to kill while adults watched and cheered them on, gives me the chills. The book is gory, much more so than the movies as the author does not sugar coat any form of pain. But aside from the violence, it is the history behind this dystopia that really drew me in. How does a society get to be so messed up? How does power get to be divided so unevenly?  Katniss isn't your typical character as in she is hard to like at first. She is cold, and not very relatable but she is also very strong. She will do anything to protect her little sister, and avoids any feelings necessary because in her world, loving someone only puts you in danger.  The whole process of the hunger games from preparing for it, to actually being in the arena is so mind blowing. There were so many moments where I asked myself: What would I do if I was in that situation? Could I have overcome that?  The violence was hard for me to take, but it seems to be a reoccurring theme throughout the trilogy. Not the kind of violence we see in racing movies or anything like that, but real human suffering. Some parts were hard to read, hard to take in, but I couldn't put down this book.  The world that Katniss lives in, is so different from ours. We may complain about problems here and there, but seeing what the people of the future-so to speak-had to go though, I appreciate that I could close the book and go back to my safe little bubble.  This book will take you out of your comfort zone for sure, but at the same time, it makes you not want to go back to that zone for a long time.
Let me begin by saying that I started and abandoned this book 3 times before I managed to muster sufficient courage to get past the opening chapters, where the shocking details of the Hunger Games were described.  The concept is beyond harrowing and, as a mother, I found it almost impossible to continue.  I eventually reminded myself that this is in fact a work of fiction and that many of the books I read during my studies were equally horrifying and had closer ties to reality (any Holocaust themed novel would fall into this category).  So I forced myself to get through the opening chapters and I am so pleased that I did.  "I couldn't put it down" must be the most overused phrase in book reviews but, the truth is, I genuinely could not put this book down.  I was completely engrossed in the plot and experienced every emotion felt by the heroine Katniss.  What a survivor!  She is a role-model for EQ (Emotional Intelligence for those of you that are not familiar with a current business fad!).  She is capable of enduring the most devastating setbacks without retreating into self-pity or victim mode. Imagine if you could teach your children that skill?  The Hunger Games is, at its essence, a book about survival.  A corrupt government forces children to battle it out to the death in a "Reality" show.  Katniss and Peeta find themselves competing in the Hunger Games and we see  the horror through the eyes of Katniss.  It is a very well written book and the main character Katniss is beautifully developed.  Peeta is not as well developed but, since the book is told from Katniss's perspective, that is to be expected.  The supporting characters have just sufficient depth to be interesting. The most important supporting character is Gale, Katniss Everdeen's best friend and hunting partner, prior to the Games.  Gale is is also a survivor, but his survival is expressed through anger and rebellion.  The foundation for the love-triangle that will be fully explored in the next two books of the trilogy, are firmly established in this opening book.  In the apocalyptic/post apocalyptic or dystopian genre, this book definitely number 1 in my opinion. This is not a book that you read this for enjoyment but rather for a sense of justice and victory!
I have no idea why I waited so long to read this; I think it sat around in my room for almost a year before I actually read it. Now, because I've read this book multiple times, I feel like I should at least tell you about my first impression. The first time I read this, I was pleased with and really liked it, but I felt like it didn't exactly live up to the all of the hype around me. I was just expecting more from it than I felt like I was given. In fact, my original rating was 4 out of 5 stars.  But since reading the rest of the series and reading this again and again, I've chosen to give it 5 stars. My opinion has now changed. I do think it lived up to the hype. But first impressions are everything, so I feel like the information above was important to give all those who read this (plus most of this review was written with my first impression in mind).  Now, on to the rest of the review....  It took me a while to really get excited about this book. But at the same time, I found it hard to put down because I had to know how Katniss survived The Hunger Games. I was kept guessing about Peeta's true loyalties for a good portion of the book.  I must admit though, from almost the very beginning, I wanted Peeta to survive, even with that question of loyalty still in the air. I found him as a instantly lovable character. And, okay, since this is all about first impressions... I thought Gale was pretty wonderful too.  From the moment the Hunger Games (the event not the book) began, the plot gripped me like never before because, of course, Katniss is going to survive; she's the main character. But you have to know how. You have to know how things turn out with Peeta. You just have to know how a certain situation resolves itself. And before you know it, once one situation is resolved, you're drawn into another and you have to know how Katniss gets through that one. And thus, this is repeated over and over again, and very effectively.  Upon finishing the book, I was completely freaking out. The end blew me away. It was a huge cliff hanger. I mean, it was worse than anything I had read at the time (The Son of Neptune's, The Lost Hero). I could not put the book down as I read the last fifty pages. And I just couldn't read it fast enough.  I also found The Hunger Games to be full of characters that you either love or completely dislike. There were few in-betweens.  I didn't particularly care for the writing style (it's one I once shied away from), but even I must admit that it was the best one for this type of book. There's nothing wrong with the writing. The Hunger Games is written in first person present, which at the time wasn't something I was accustomed to reading when I passed through it the first time. So, you will probably find in other reviews on books written the same way, I feel differently about it, but that's because it doesn't bother me anymore. Thank you, Suzanne Collins.

***SPOILER ALERT***  The following book review contains spoilers.  Introduction  This review is mainly for those few of you who have neither read the book nor seen the popular movie and don't mind a few spoilers. The Hunger Games is a traditional hero story with a young heroine Katniss Everdeen. The political environment in the future United States is a harsh dictatorship ruled by an elite district who leeches off of the other 12 districts by consuming their resources and living in utter luxury. They rule with an iron fist. They use tactics such as intimidation, execution, extensive monitoring, and heavy handed punishments for dissenters. While the government (located at the Capitol Panem) seems to have a strong grasp on the political landscape, in reality, their hold in tenuous at best. There is a rising undercurrent of discontent. As in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, the capitol is entirely dependent on the outlying districts for all their natural resources.  Like the school bully who steals the weaker kid's lunch money, Panem bullies the other districts into submission.  The biggest way that Panem keeps the districts under control is by the use of a gladiatorial  contest called the Hunger Games.  The parallel with ancient Rome is a little too obvious. The difference being that the arena is not in some Coliseum, but is shifted from place to place. Its purpose is psychological intimidation. The bully tries to remind the bullied how weak they really are. But, what happens when the bullied get sick and tired of the situation? What President Snow really fears is that the districts will somehow gain a sense of hope; that some underdog will show up the Capitol and embarrass them.  Suzanne Collins Interview  This is exactly how Katniss Everdeen functions in this story. She is thrust into the spotlight by the Hunger Games. She survives; she actually wins the Hunger Games. Somehow they (She and Peeta) are allowed to share the title. There is supposed to be only one winner among the 24 tributes. By them both threatening suicide, they call the bluff of the Capitol and manipulate themselves into the winners circle.  Though they are winners, they really don't possess freedom anymore. They function as the ultimate propaganda machine. The state uses the winners to train other tributes. The ultimate victims become the victimizers. It reinforces the control that the capitol has over the districts.  Book Recommendation  The intended audience of this series is young adult readers. It seems to be on about an 8th grade reading level. I think the book could have been more sophisticated in its plot structure. Also, the story is told in the first person with Katniss as the narrator. While this works in much of the book, it does get tiresome at times to only see things from her perspective. I think that if the story had been in the third person with flashes of omniscience for significant characters; this would have added to the richness of the story.  The book is fast paced and is remarkable in that it builds tension quite well. The dialog is well done and realistic. I thought that Katniss seemed a little too resilient as a character. She seems to go right along with the games. Then again, Katniss is a survivor. She will do whatever it takes to stay alive. She does a great job of pretending; putting on a fake smile where needed; going along with the suggestions of her trainer, Haymitch.  One of the strongest character traits of Katniss is her compassion for the weak. She cares deeply about others. For example, in the arena, she tries to help Rue, a young 12-year old tribute from District 11. She mourns Rue's loss.  I think Collins does a superb job of portraying the trauma of the games. This is a life and death struggle involving kids from 12 to 18 years old. It's hard to stomach and makes the reader feel the trauma of what it's like to live under a repressive regime.  I would certainly recommend this book to any young reader. If you are a parent, you will have to use your own judgment as far as how young, but the worst thing is probably the violence in the book. All in all, this is an excellent series. Suzanne Collins has done a superb job in creating a world that engrosses the reader. Perhaps its lack of complexity in both plot and structure is well suited to its intended young adult audience. With that being said, I think all readers will find the story very enjoyable.
I admit, I picked this up and read this because I wanted to see what all of the hype was about. Everyone I know was talking about or reading this, or had seen the movie. I am funny. I will not see a movie if I have not read the book that goes with it, so I hadn't seen it yet. I have been getting some nudging from a friend, so figured I should read the book and see what it was all about.  In the beginning, Katniss seemed kind of fickle to me, in terms of response to male attention. She has this guy right in front of her, and yet it is almost like she does not even see him. When I was a teenager, I would have killed for a boy to have been that attentive to me.  I imagine Gale to be this handsome, tall young man who one would just melt into.  When you get into the meat of the story, you start to see the dynamic of the characters and who they really are, but it takes a little while to get there. There is a degree of frustration in reading, because the writing is somewhat juvenile, but entirely too graphic for some YA readers in their earlier teens.  The compassion Katniss is shown after she steps up after the horrific feeling when her sister's name is called is amazing, though. I mean, you never expect to hear them call Prim, because her name was only in there once. It just does not seem possible. But it happens, and it is there, in black and white, and I was shocked, horrified. All of the same emotions I imagine Katniss was feeling.  But then you meet Peeta, who you instantly fall in love with, and find yourself tuning the pages just to see what is going to happen.  Overall, the story was enjoyable and suspenseful, if a bit horrifying. I would recommend this book highly to older teens and adults (16-17+). I think some younger readers or some who are more sensitive might have a hard time with the level of violence in this book.
I had heard so much about this book that I just had to get it. I bought this one and the second one in the trilogy, Catching Fire, at the same time and read them both is a little more than a day =)  The Hunger Games gives us a look in a possible future of the society and world we live in today. We follow Katniss about a century after environmental catastrophes have changed the face of North America and the former United States is now Panem, a nation divided into 12 districts and a Capitol.  Katniss lives in district 12 and has been taking care of her mother and little sister since her father died years ago. Living in poverty, Katniss relies on unconventional methods to feed her family with the the help of her best friend Gale.  74 years before the Districts rebelled against The Capitol and lost. As a lesson to its citizens The Capitol holds The Hunger Games every year. The Hunger Games are a reality show where 2 children of each district enter an arena and the last one left alive will be set for life. Yes, you read that right, the last one left alive! They have to kill each other!  I have to say I was pleasantly surprise by how amazing this book is. Suzanne has created such a believable world and characters that is just so easy to get lost in their lives. It is shocking and disturbing to realize how credible is this tragic future created by her. How easy it is to believe that our utter disregard for the Earth can lead us to such a life and our society's love for reality TV and obsession  with perfection can lead us to a society as such described in The Capitol, where people look like freaks by over using plastic surgery.  I fell completely in love with Katniss. She is such a great heroine and you can't help but root for her every step of the way. Her love and devotion for her sister is heart breaking and seeing her putting herself on the line so that her little sister doesn't have to go the brutal Games is an inspiration.  I was utterly disturbed by this future world. The idea that watching kids killing each other is entertainment disgusted me. This book brought me to tears so many times. It is impossible to read it and not commit yourself to it completely!  There is also romance in this book and what every fan of this series is going to ask is which Team are on? Team Peeta or Team Gale?  The Hunger Games is a must read for any YA lover out there. Its fun, emotional, entertaining, politically engaged, disturbing, action packed, it has got it all. I did not put down this book for a second! If you haven't read The Hunger Games, what are you waiting for?  Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa's Bookish Life {larissaslife DOT com}
The Hunger Games is the best book for a middle school student to read right now. There are, of course, the classics that will be enjoyed by everyone forevermore, but if you know a preteen, you should recommend that they read The Hunger Games, as it is the best young adult fiction novel on the market. If you have a few days to devote to a book, because youll need to set time aside as you wont be able to put it down mid-chapter, you should read it, too.   The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins follows Katniss Everdeen, a  tribute from coal-mining District 12 of Panem, the totalitarian government that exists in what was once known as North America. After spending the last few years illegally hunting in the Appalachian Mountains to provide for her family after the death of her father, she volunteers to fight in the Hunger Games in the place of her younger sister. The annual Hunger Games pits twenty-four teenage tributes from the districts of Panem against each other in a battle to the death, a gruesome reminder of the strength of the state. Their horrific deaths are televised nationally to the entire country, most of whom are being forced to watch their children kill and be killed.   The Hunger Games is a reflection of our nations obsession with reality television. With current reality television shows like Survivor and Toddlers &amp; Tiaras that exploit and manipulate both the contestants and the audience, where will our society draw the line? Collins ability to present these ideas to a preteen audience and force adults to contemplate their own role in the reality television phenomena while creating a plot so riveting and characters so alive is commendable and will be rewarded by a reading of the sequel, Catching Fire.
Of all the books Suzanne Collins has written, Hunger Games is by far the best and certainly the most popular. This book is heart stopping and you will not want to stop reading. The protagonist, 16 year old Katniss Everdeen, is faced with the hardest decision in her life. After her father passed away in a mining accident Katniss had to take over as head of the house and care for her little sister, Prim. Being very poor she had to learn early how to hunt for food. This meant facing the wilderness and learning the ways of the woods. But at the reaping, her world suddenly turns upside down. The reaping is where two children from each district, one boy and one girl in-between the ages of 11 and 18, are chosen to fight to the death in an arena for the entertainment of the citizens of the Capitol. There are a total of twelve districts, Katniss being in the 12th. These Games were created by the President of Panem because of an uprising of the districts against the Capitol. The Hunger Games occurs every year to suppress the districts. All of the kids in the arena have one objective, to win. By the end, there is only one lone victor, everyone else dies. These people are forced to kill before they get killed.  In this thrilling book Katniss takes the biggest risk of her life, to volunteer to go into the Games. Throughout the Games Katniss must remember everything that she has learned back home, and put it into good use. On her journey she makes, and loses, friends.  Escaping death isn't easy. Katniss only has one objective on her mid, to win for her sister Prim. I highly recommend this book and you should definitely read the books that fallow to see what happens to Katniss after the Hunger Games are over. This is such a great, heart-pounding book that is necessary to read!
The Hunger Games benefits from a style that's both teen-age readable, but adult flavored in character development and plot. Collins succeeds where amateurs like Stephanie Meyers or E L James fail, in that she can appeal to readers en masse without insulting their intelligence. It's easy enough for teenagers and adults to navigate, but it leaves much for all audiences to contemplate; The main social commentary being one that addresses an unapologetic, autocratic government and its struggle to control its oppressed, starving and dying citizens.  The series is a coming of age tale set in a post apocalyptic United States, ala Brave New World or Ender's Game. It focuses on its young, teen-aged protagonist Katniss Everdeen and her struggle to stay alive using her skills of rugged survival and her love of family. Collins incorporates elements of present day societal preoccupation with with reality television, elimination style games and violent sports theatrics. Katniss must use her wit and dedication to family in order to make wise, prudent decisions while she is a victim of her governments cruel, barbaric gladiator games.  The Hunger Games is easy enough to blaze through in just a night's worth of reading, but it's intelligent enough to have you either reading it again or scouring the internet for a suitable discussion board to share your thoughts and propositions. My biggest gripe is that amazon seems to be gouging buyers with a hefty price tag for such an easy perusal. Melville and Dumas are much cheaper and far harder to discern. If you're a prime user, you can borrow any of the books in the series for free, but only one book per month. Still, I advise you to do just that before you invest a lot into this relatively simple trilogy. If nothing else, there are plenty of readers that i'm sure someone is more than willing to lend you their copy. Take advantage of that!  I encourage any user looking for a good read this month to check out the first chapter in the HG trilogy or continue your journey through the story and pick up book 2 or 3. Even if you're not a fan of the genre, you'll still be entertained. I Guarantee!
Collins, Suzanne. The Hunger Games. New York: Scholastic, 2008. Print.    The Hunger Games is an addictive and worthwhile read in the way it confronts violence, humanity, and sexism through the adventure of a lifetime. The story begins as the reader is introduced to a young, female protagonist named Katniss Everdeen. She resides with her mother and sister, Primrose, in a dystopia called District 12, which is one district in Panem's society. Collins sets the story in Panem, a post apocalyptic North America ruled by the totalitarian Capitol, in which the twelve districts are subject to the rule and complete domination of the Capitol. Those individuals who live in the districts are forced to produce goods for the Capitol and rationed out little in return creating a very stratified economy. The society that Katniss lives in is heavily watched and guarded with electric fences, Peacekeepers, and other futuristic technologies used to manage the citizens of Panem. Because of a revolt that once occurred against this control, District 13 was done away with and the Hunger Games were instituted as a reminder of the Capitol's power and as a way to discourage any other rebellion.    The Hunger Games are an annual fight-to-the-death competition in which each of the twelve districts must send two tributes: one male and one female between the ages twelve to eighteen. The tributes are chosen at random based on how many times their names are in the drawing which increases with age and based on how many rations they take out for their families. Though Katniss reassures her sister that she will not be chosen because her name is only in the drawing one time, Primrose is in fact chosen for as the female tribute for her district. Katniss selflessly and immediately takes her place and is joined by the male tribute Peeta Mellark.    Prior to the reaping, Katniss would often venture outside of the fences, as her father had taught her, to hunt with her bow. Katniss is accompanied by Gale Hawthorne on her short, illegal hunting expeditions and together they experience a small taste of freedom as they pursue food to sustain their families. A love triangle unfolds over Katniss giving her the central power. Every move that the tributes make in the arena is recorded and played back for all of Panem to watch showing every gruesome death and violent action. Though the plot of The Hunger Games contains many violent scenes, they serve an important role.    The violence in The Hunger Games is often very detailed. Because the setting is submerged in such disparity with forces that humanity today cannot relate to, there is distance from the terror of the gruesome atrocity of children murdering children. The violence is a statement of the pain that wars in the past have caused and also a warning against a path to more violence in the future. By having the setting in a future, post apocalyptic time period, it is inferable that it could be the path that is ahead if changes are not made. The Hunger Games are an absurdity for anyone to imagine, but it forces the reader to think of the contemporary world through a lens of antiviolence and examine the injustices that are going on today in the streets, schools, and behind closed doors. By recognizing its purpose for using violence, The Hunger Games becomes not only a desirable read, but a necessary one. It details the way that one person actually can make a difference and a life of oppression is not fixed.    Collins does not allow for nonsense in her writing as transports the reader to another world. She creates characters with depth and writes Katniss as an example of strength. Katniss is not perfect with her sarcasm, stoicism, and hard-headedness, but her flaws are often only the result of her caring too much. It is important to keep in mind that she, as well as the rest of the citizens in the districts, is damaged by her society to her core and the oppression they face incredible. Her mother represents the way that many would like to behave after being so oppressed because it is easier to crawl back in a shell. Katniss, though, keeps going.    The Hunger Games is a story of empowerment for both men and women because its gender neutrality allows everyone to find a way to connect to the story. Collins challenges the harsh barriers of sexism in past and contemporary cultures as she includes both males and females in the Hunger Games. With Katniss, she creates a new woman. One who exuberates the qualities both men and women respect and admire. Katniss is a hero and often this concept is lost because she also has to be a killer. Through her, the reader is forced out of his or her comfort zone into a situation that is surreal where right and wrong become blurred and it is up to the individual's inner conscience to decipher between them. Motives are tested and true character comes out in the choices the tributes make.    The Hunger Games is an addictive read that is impossible to put down. The writing is intoxicating as Collins takes the reader down the journey of a lifetime. She does not direct the reader to fall for one character or chose one side, but she presents a story with a lesson about the value of life. If you are tired of the obvious allegories, this is the book for you. It has depth, but it is also enjoyable and quick. It gives perspective and looks at the greater picture. You may find it necessary to ignore the bandwagon and all the focus on "Team Gale" or "Team Peeta" because they delude from the heart and purpose of the novel. The Hunger Games is a story that will entertain, excite, enrage, and leave you starving for more. What more can you ask of a book?
I read The Hunger Games for the first time when it was still new -- back before Mockingjay had been released and before the movie was even so much as a whispering throughout the fandom. I read it because of the enormous number of positive reviews on the book blogs that I frequented, and I read it under the false assumption that the Arena was something like the Colosseum, where gladiators would fight one another to the death. I was also under the false impression that it was Peeta and Katniss alone who had to fight to the death.  Anybody who has read the book or seen the movie knows that my assumptions were completely untrue, if not a bit bizarre.  In the beginning, I wasn't expecting to love The Hunger Games. I'm not at all a fan of first person perspective and I really detest the present tense because it's so easy to get tenses confused. In fact, Suzanne Collins botches her past tense, past perfect tense and past participle on several occasions in the book, in large part because most writers are accustomed to writing in the past tense when producing fictional pieces. I found this especially frustrating, but bearing in mind that I'm reading young adult fiction, I found it to be forgivable.  The second primary problem that I have with this novel is the fact that, having read it three times, I've decided that I don't really like Katniss Everdeen. So allow me to talk about that for a moment. Considering that I've talked about The Hunger Games since I finished reading the novel for the first time, I often feel that I've said it all, but perhaps I haven't.  The majority of teen fiction presents us with some variation on the perfect heroine. She's either entirely distasteful, or she's so amazingly perfect that it's impossible not to love her. We either totally pity her or we wish that we could be her. As much as I don't personally like Katniss, she's not that perfect heroine. She's flawed, but not perfectly flawed. While she lacks self confidence, she is aware of her skills as a hunter and of her emotional weaknesses. She is neither perfect nor is she perfectly imperfect. Katniss is the type of character that you should be able to like (and many people do like her), but I just don't.  Strangely, I like that about this book. I like the fact that neither Gale nor Peeta are perfect heroes, and I like the fact that there's no rivalry between Peeta and Gale, but each takes his own important role in Katniss' life. The love triangle aspect is to be expected due to its popularity among female teen readers, but it is so incidental in this series that it can be ignored, and the series can be taken for its meaning.  Another reviewer referred to this book (and series) not being for intelligent readers. I have to disagree with that standpoint. The book is highly political and shows us the possibility of what can happen when a tyrannical government takes over a country. There are strong references throughout the series to the conditions in communist countries, and it's easy to become engrossed in the dystopian society where the government controls everything and the nation is constantly at war. A thoughtful reading of these novels is bound to open the minds of young people to the possibility that a government can become oppressive -- as many world governments have in the past.  The Hunger Games is an educational experience. As an adult reader, I have to say that I would be cautious about giving this book to a younger audience to read, and feel that it is best reserved for mature teen readers who are able to handle the deeper meaning of the scenes that they will read in this novel.  That being said, my step children (at the time 13 and 14) loved all three books in the trilogy!
I've avoided this book, I've avoided the movie... I saw trailers for the movie and it looked good but the premise was just too brutal for me. So, why now? Mostly I deal with audiobooks and right now there's a 2 for 1 sale at Audible. I found one book in the sale that I really wanted and I needed to pick another one so I started researching the other books available. I almost passed this by again. I listened to the sample and didn't like the narrator. Somehow I got to a "read the first chapter" spot and I was hooked. This is the first thing I've done since I started reading several hours ago. It's terrible to start the book knowing that any character you become fond of is likely to die. Since it's a first person narrative you have to assume that Katniss is going to survive. How the story unfolded is gripping. There were other things I should have done, but I kept telling myself I'd stop at the end of the next chapter. Except I never noticed the ends of chapters. The world Collins has created here is gripping. There are other dystopian worlds out there that I've enjoyed reading but none has caught me up the way this one did. Am I sorry I waited so long? Will I see the movie? Certainly the answer to the first one is no, I'm glad I waited. I'd be in emotional agony if I couldn't go right on to reading the next book. As for the movie, maybe, maybe not. It sounds as though it follows the plot of the book well, but I'm a reader. The characters and the setting come alive in my mind and I'm seldom satisfied with someone else's picture. The big question, do I recommend that YOU read it. I can't say. There's so much violence and the premise is heartbreaking. I tend to enjoy books with guaranteed happy endings. I can't guarantee you all happiness... and I have to read the Catching Fire, and Mockingjay to know how I feel about the whole story. I'll be starting Catching Fire this evening. I really hope I get to sleep tonight.
The Hunger Games, a book with much enthusiasm, struck me as a work of art within its context.  The story remains on a teenage girl living in a post-apocalyptic world.  The book explains how there is one very important event that happens each year known as the Hunger Games.  The games require one girl and boy to be offered up, to fight to the death until there is a lone victor.  Each district offers two as sacrifices and as punishment for rebelling against the Capitol in past years.  When Katnisss sister is chosen during the reaping she eagerly volunteers in her place.  The book is a mix of a tragic love story yet gruesome in retrospect.  The book has many strengths, but strengths come with weaknesses.  It is wonderfully built with action packed scenes and also the small instances of sorrow.  The fight at the Cornucopia, the incident with Tracker Jackers(a poisonous wasp), when the small girl from District Eleven dies; All of these events are works of art nimbly crafted with a writers precise and measure.   The book also has weaknesses.  It is told in mostly thought process, which may be unappealing to readers due to the lack of physical action.  It also has a small number of cheesy love scenes which may not appeal to the boy population of our country. I personally recommend this book to the ages of 12 and up because it begins to introduce a higher level of writing to readers.  For the ages 12 and below the book is not recommended due to the presence of non-kid appropriate scenes, gruesome detail, and romantic casualties.  I believe the authors purpose was to create a story which entertained readers with combat, love, and sorrow.  The author achieved her purpose with high scores in my opinion, because of the way the book pulled me in and caused me to want to read more.  I believe that Suzanne Collins tried to create a book that focuses on what our world could be like in future years.  Also due to the amount of thought process given by Katniss, in times of distress (In the Cornucopia, and when she is blowing up the careers food), and when she slowly begins to fall for Peeta (In the cave when she kisses him, and when she calls his name after one of the announcements in the games) makes the book slightly unappealing for readers.  I, as a person who loves to read can sometimes tell when an author has truly made a book that can connect to readers.  I could put myself in Katnisss situation, and could connect to the way she was feeling.  This caused me to enjoy reading the book very much, and I still enjoy reading it over again because of that element.  I do believe that Suzanne Collins achieved her purpose in writing the book, because it was vey enthralling to read and it caught my attention and pulled me into the book.  I have given this book a 5 star rating because of the statements that I have made above.  I truly believe that this is an educated story that uses grammar and writing techniques the way that they are supposed to be used.  It is a book that has influenced readers and has achieved the title "A Great Book".  It is a wonderful and compelling story that has attracted readers across the globe.
Review of Hunger Games  Wesley Powell  Composition II  Excelsior College    Abstract  Authors strive to intrigue their readers through a series of actions and human responses to conflicts by carefully planning out the plot and structure of the story. The plot is the main idea and the subsequent actions that build up to the climax and resolution. Roberts explains the relation of plot and structure as follows, "unlike plot, which is concerned with conflict or conflicts, structure defines the layout of works- the ways in which the story, play, or poem is shaped" (Roberts, 2012). A quick review of the popular novel The Hunger Games written by Suzanne Collins will allow us to see how the plot of a story plays out and the various types of structure able authors to mystify a reader with words.  "I volunteer!" I gasp. "I volunteer as tribute" (Collins, 2008). These words muttered by Katniss Everdeen as she desperately tries to protect her younger sister are the same words that throw her into an arena with people who are out for her blood. The main plot of this story concerns a young girl who is forced to fight to the death against others she has never come into contact with except a young boy from her village. Panem is made up of the Capitol and twelve districts that are fiercely controlled by President Snow. The Hunger Games were conceived as a way to prove superiority of the Capitol over the districts and to punish them for past rebellious actions. Collins quickly puts the plot of the story in motion when Katniss volunteers to fight on behalf of her sister; this is the first major conflict. Stories are made up mostly of actions or incidents that follow one another in chronological order which is considered the plot (Roberts, 2012). Several actions and events occur throughout the story causing conflict for Katniss and putting her in a position to make decisions that subsequently lead to other events, shaping her future and fate. Roberts states that, "conflicts promote characters to engage in the decisions, actions, responses, and interactions that make up fictional literature." At the beginning of the story Katniss is forced to fight to her death in the upcoming Hunger Games therefore creating a conflict which requires decisions such as what tactic she will use, what weapons will be available, how she will cope with killing another human and so on.  Once Katniss makes a decision to resolve a conflict it opens the door to another requiring yet another decision to be made creating a domino effect until the end of the story. Depending on what type of story the author is writing, the plot may be revealed in various ways which leads into how a story is structured.  Formal structures of a story consist of five parts that follow each other in exact order. Stories usually begin with background information, setting the scene, and/or other important information that pulls the reader in and makes them acquainted with the characters in the story; this is the exposition. Next is the complication which is the plot and lays out the major conflicts. Crisis and Climax follow in order and are sometimes very difficult to distinguish. During the crisis, a decision or an action to resolve the conflict is undertaken and the climax is a consequence of that crisis and is considered the highpoint in the story leading to the resolution (Roberts, 2012). Resolution is intended to finish up the story and make sense of previous sections. The Hunger Games is not a formal structured story and is purposefully designed to entice the reader by leaving out bits of crucial information about characters or throwing in new events that complicate the matter at hand. This technique is done by manipulating the structure by placing the exposition within the middle or ends of the story instead of in the beginning. For example, Katniss is aware that one other person from her district is competing in the games with her but she does not have any affiliation with him at first making her decision to kill him easy but right before the games begin, Peeta (the other tribute), throws a major conflict at Katniss. The following is part of an interview with Peeta where this conflict unfolds.  "Handsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. Come on, what's her name?" says Caesar. Peeta sighs. "Well, there is this one girl. I've had a crush on her since I can remember. But I'm pretty sure she didn't know I was alive until the reaping." Sounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they can relate to. "She have another fellow?" asks Caesar. "I don't know, but a lot of boys like her," says Peeta. "So, here's what you do. You win, you go home. She can't turn you down then, eh?" says Caesar encouragingly. "I don't think its going to work out. Winning....won't help in my case," says Peeta. "Why ever not?" says Caesar, mystified. Peeta blushed beet red and stammers out. "Because...because...she came here with me." (Collins, 2008)  By withholding the facts about Peetas feelings for Katniss in the beginning and revealing them in the middle of the story adds a twist that hooks readers into the plot. This technique is also used to write mystery stories where the reader is aware of facts that the characters themselves are oblivious to.  Every story, novel, poem or piece of literature you may read contains a plot with conflicts and is structured in a way that aids the writer in conveying the message to the reader. It is important to understand the parts of a formal structure and what they mean so you can locate all the pieces of the puzzle and know how to put them together to reveal the plot.

The Hunger Games is a wonderfully written story about first loves and survival. It takes you through the emotional ups and downs of any new relationship; like questioning the reality of the relationship, trying to sort out the emotions tied to the relationships and determining if the future of the relationship is plausible for both parties. We get to watch the teenage parties as they struggle with their emotions and do their best to cope with the formidable situation they are in. The audience can not help but to become attached to the main characters and the raw emotion Susan Collins portrays in her writing. Many times I would find myself rooting for them, cheering them on or dreading the dismal future that lay ahead of the main characters.    Collins does a wonderful job of painting a love story that developed under unusual circumstances. The readers are slowly led through the series of encounters between the two main characters and their struggles with the emotions they are feeling and the conflict of the situation. The love story alone is so involving that readers may find it virtually impossible to set the book down. Even after I forced myself to do so, I continually found myself daydreaming back to the story line in my everyday activities. Those of us that read ourselves to sleep will find it difficult to do so with this book. Every page draws you deeper and deeper into the adventure until you have been completely engulfed in the story. Even in pausing for a snack you will find yourself rushing through so you can read a little bit more. The story beckons you back again and again until it has been finished.    This strikingly odd combination of plots makes for an unforgettable adventure whose finale is so incredible you want to immediately search for the sequel. The reader is taken for quite an emotional ride through these pages. Just when you think you can predict the storyline, another twist arises and the reader finds that what they once "knew" was not what actually occurred after all. Collins does a wonderful job of tying murderous acts and simple acts of love together in a unique way that creates a most enticing story line. She does a wonderful job of providing proper closure to book one while also staging the scene for book two.    From page one to the end Collins does an excellent job of capturing the attention of the audience. As one twist begins to come to a close, a new one is introduced and we are again thrown for an emotional loop that almost requires us to read another 30 pages. The character development of the love story is written so smoothly it calls to its reader's personal experiences and adds to the almost hypnotic effect the adventure contains. I highly recommend this book to all readers and can not wait to see if the film has done the book justice. My best advice is to make sure that you have book two readily available even before you begin book one. You are definitely going to need it.
It's been a rather long time since I did that -- read a reasonable-length book in a single sitting. Last time I did that was...maybe Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? In any case, it's been awhile since I read a true page-turner I wouldn't put down. (Although I'm certain the relative brevity of this book -- I have read Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss, and the Wheel of Time lately -- had something to do its being awhile.)  How to describe this book plotwise? Think The Lottery meets reality TV, or think kids meet the gladiator arena. Basically, the one far-dominant nation-state in North America -- the Capitol -- has utterly subjugated twelve subordinate districts (and reduced a thirteenth to irradiated embers). Each district must annually send two "tributes" -- a male and a female between the ages of 12 and 18, chosen by lottery -- to fight to the death in the arena in the Hunger Games. The Games are a pageant from start to finish to entertain the Capitol, which eagerly watches (and forces the districts to watch) until one tribute remains (to be showered with honor for life, and whose district will be honored for that year). The arena itself is a massive tract of land under the total control of the Capitol -- terrain, vegetation, weather, and resources. The tributes learn skills and acquire supporters (who can sometimes send supplies), then they are deposited in the arena. It's a fight to the death -- first for a Cornucopia of supplies positioned at the arena entrypoint, then a protracted strategic dance to attack, and survive the attacks of, the other tributes.  A logical plot? Well, not entirely. The Capitol and districts occupy much of the United States and/or North America, but the impression is that at most total we're talking a few million people, with the rest of the area wild. Given the state of Capitol technology at least, this underpopulation is implausible. And it's hard to think the brutality of the Games a believable possibility in some distant future of our world. (Judged closer in proximity to the original gladiators, maybe. But evil today is generally much more subtle than it was back then -- or at least concerning the United States area particularly -- and I see little reason to believe that subtilty might disappear.) But it's enough to hang a story on it -- and a good story, too. The action comes steadily once the contestants enter the arena, and before then the slow reveal of the mechanics of the game remain captivating. The heroine's cleverness abounds, in a way that naturally fits her youth (and probably would not fit an older, wiser character), and the tactics are a pleasure to consider.  This said, this remains a young-adult novel. The action is mostly for action's sake. We don't learn enough of the underpinnings of the world to truly understand how it has come to be, or why it truly is so, or how it might be (at the far periphery, of course) even ambiguously "moral". We aren't left with much in the way of poignant questions to ponder, of the sort a far better book like Ender's Game (or even the later Harry Potter books) offers. The heroine has some depth, and some of the Capitol stooges surprisingly acquire a little personality by the end, but characterizations are mostly shallow. We're mostly left with a lot of grit (they're trying to kill each other, remember? and of course pageantry will demand it sometimes be brutal) and a dilemma that gets solved. Which is all perfectly fun, to be sure -- but it's not the sort of thing that would cause me to sidetrack reading a hundred pages of the book just because I happened to rearrange it on my bookshelf. (Which happens with all too much frequency for me...)  It was a two-month wait for the hundred-odd people ahead of me at the library to read this so I could borrow a copy; I'm currently 58 of 72 for the second and 22 of 31 for the third (having not considered that, given queue lengths, I should submit holds early, "freezing" holds if needed before they might prematurely vest). Will I wait for my name to move to the front of these queues to continue reading? It seems likely I will, rather than buy the later books to read them faster. I found the characters interesting, yet I'm not emotionally invested in them, and the ending is not a cliffhanger of the sort demanding immediate resolution. I can wait.  (...and, two weeks later, I find myself buying the entire series in Kindle editions on Amazon. Because the library queue is still huge, instant gratification is irresistible, and I keep having to watch out for spoilers when reading things online. Perhaps I should add another star...but no. This book was what it was, and needing to read further doesn't change that.)
Hunger Games is an unusual and adventurous fictional book written by Suzanne Collins. The author captures her audiences attention and draws them into this mind blowing adventure where a mystical world is created, forcing you to stay up night and day, craving more. I felt like I was pulled into this fascinating tale, I laughed and cried with the characters, almost hypnotized in a sense.   An authoritarian government, the Capital, displays threats of war unto 12 districts that they hold direct power over. This is the year, of the 74th Hunger Games, where one male and one female from each district between the ages of 12-18 years of age are chosen as a tribute to fight to the death until there is only one remaining survivor. The survivor wins food for his district for one whole year. Prim just turned 12 years old, and is finally able to be thrown in the jar of names for the first time, and miraculously is selected as the female tribute for District 12. Katniss Everdeen, Prims older sister, volunteers to take her place in games, not able to bear the thought of her sweet little sister fighting to the death. Peeta Mellark, who turns out to be in love with Katniss, is the male chosen. These two star-crossed lovers are to forced to fight the other district children to the death. Allegiance is found and destroyed as the stronger children team up to kill the weak. Peeta betrays and later saves Katniss, making her confused as to where his loyalty lies. In the end they are the only two children left standing. The rules of the games are changed to allow two tributes from each district to live, vice one.  Peeta and Katniss remain as the last living tributes, when the Gamemakers decide to change the rules back to one living tribute. Peeta and Katniss rebel as they attempted to commit dual suicide, leading to chaos in the Districts.   This is the just a taste of the beginning of the Hunger Games, the first book in an amazing trilogy.  The author propels her reader through the chronicle as they are drawn into this world of fantasy where there is an adventure full of drama, betrayal, and love. Collins does an excellent job, and makes you feel as if you are a part of this world with her extensive details. I could not put this book down. I read the entire trilogy in one week, and had withdrawals when it ended, I wanted more. I searched for other books to fill the void that was left when the Hunger Games trilogy ended.   I would recommend this to older children, maybe in middle school and up. Its an easy book to read with a lot of action, where a child and an adult can easily relate to the story. Kids are exposed to violence at such a young age with all the video games and even the news now a day, so I guess maybe the higher elementary kids could enjoy this too. The book is definitely better than the movie, as with most books turned movies, a lot of detail is missing, and the story changes a slight bit, with the plot remaining the same. I imagined Peeta much more handsome than he was played in the movie, a definite downer in my opinion. This is a must read! I highly recommend it.
This is one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. It involves excellent writing, plot and characters. The movie based upon this book is also well done but easier to understand if you first read the book.  Katniss Everdeen is a teenage girl in a post-Apocalyptic country of Panem--a land once called North America. She hunts and struggles to find food for her widowed mother, younger sister and herself. People are literally starving to death.  Each year the oppressive government selects two tributes in a reaping (one boy and one girl between 12-18 years of age) from each of twelve districts to compete in the Hunger Games. Katniss lives in District 12, the poorest of poor. Most people with jobs work in Coal mines. Her father died in a mining accident.  Much like the arena games of ancient Rome, the Hunger Game contestants must survive, fight and die until only one of them remains...the Victor of that year's games. Although most people live without any modern conveniences the government and people in the Capital city have excessive riches and the Hunger Games are broadcast live across the country on television where residents are "required" to watch them. In 74 years, District 12 has had a winner only twice and the only surviving victor is Haymitch Abernathy who will serve as coach for the current contestants from his district. He is an embittered man who spends much of his time drunk...not being able to cope with the guilt about his own Hunger Games, the grief of what happened to the people he loved and the fact he must coach and watch new tributes from his district die in the games every year.  Katniss' sister Prim is 12 and it's her first year to have her name entered in the Tribute reaping.  As a first year entry, her name is only entered once so odds are against her being chosen. Nonetheless, she is chosen as the female tribute from District 12. Prim is innocent and fragile. Katniss loves her very much and is extremely protective of Prim, so she volunteers to take her place.  Katniss finds herself preparing for and participating in the Hunger Games along with Peeta Mellark, the baker's son from her district who once took pity upon her by tossing her some cast-off bread.  Peeta has secretly had a crush on Katniss for years. He's very kind and likeable but Katniss mustn't allow herself to like him. To survive, she must be the last of 24 tributes left alive. Tragically, either Peeta or Katniss must die, if either tribute from District 12 is to survive.  In addition to toughness, survival and fighting skills, the victor must also cultivate charmisma because the contestants are show-cased on live television before and during the games. Tributes who elicite sympathy from viewers may be sent "gifts" during the games such as food, water or medicine.  Katniss doesn't feel comfortable in the role but she has the help of people who cast her and Peeta as "star-crossed lovers" forced to compete against one another in the Hunger Games and also portray her as the Girl-On-Fire. She becomes very popular among the crowds...a fate which may help her survive this year's Hunger Games but also make her a threat to the very government. But that's a story for the sequels. For the rest of the story, also read: Catching Fire and Mockingjay.
The movie buzz is what got me interested in the series, but I wanted to read the books as soon as possible. I read them the 1st time a few weeks after seeing the movie and read them a 2nd time several months later  I was amused that Stephenie Meyer has a quote on the cover, since she's not one to talk about good writing. Twitter user UncleYo put it as follows - "Stephanie Meyers has a quoted review on The Hunger Games' cover. That's like Justin Bieber reviewing The White Album."  I felt the book and the movie were both good, just different, they were both effective in their storytelling medium.  In both cases, I caught a lot more details the 2nd time.  The big difference is that Peeta seemed a lot more impressive in the book.  It makes sense that the would-be Mrs. Everdeen met him buying medicinal herbs, but I had remembered the Mellark story of falling for an Everdeen singing voice.  Mrs. Everdeen's old nice clothes was another cool reference to her past.  Peeta taking Haymitch to task in the morning on the train gave me more respect for Peeta. I liked how Katniss felt threatened rather than impressed by that.  Peeta and his father being so nice made it harder to hate them like I had wanted to.  Peeta's behavior now seems like obvious foreshadowing of his interest in Katniss.  I noticed Peeta wondering if his father wanted daughters. I wondered about that for many parent characters, including Mr. Everdeen and sons. I hadn't remembered the concept was mentioned in canon.  It seemed odd for Katniss to mention horse alongside beef and chicken as fancy meat Merchant Section people ate.  Training seemed different, more of a struggle/challenge but also more productive.  It seemed like a fighting challenge should be solely about fighting skill instead of ability to talk up sympathy. I had blamed tributes/staff for an underhanded tactic instead of the Capitol for setting it up that way. Also, part of me underestimating Peeta was his fighting skills.  Because it's dystopic fiction, a lot of it besides the characters' personality traits doesn't seem personally relevant. I identified with Katniss' negative personality traits of excessive cynicism, not wanting any help and underestimating oneself. I had seen Peeta as a loser for being even worse at talking to women than I am, dismissing much of the rest of him.  Evne though the setting is extreme, I identified with Katniss' habit of excessive cynicism, not wanting any help and underestimating oneself. Peeta seemed like a great counterpoint to all that. At first I thought he was kind of a loser for being even worse at talking to women than I am (is that possible?). That has caused me to overlook many of his strengths.  The rooftop moral stand came off differently. In the movie, it seemed noble. Book Katniss saw it as holier-than-thou. I understood why Katniss was surprised at the crush reveal, but handn't understood why she was angry about it. Well, at first she had seen Peeta as competition, and it took her some time to lose that feeling. That seems why it took her a lot of tiem to fall in love with him and stop being in denial about that.  The arena action moved fast, yet was still well described - the dehyradration, fireballs, Rue conversation, supplies destruction, all of it. Cato was reeling form the tracker jacker attack, which is why he couldn't manage to finish off Peeta - I thought that was a plot hole. Similarly, I'm not sure if Clove really waited too long to finish off Katniss.  I noticed Katniss talking about her hearing gradually returning. I forgot there were two cave scenes, before and after the feast. It was clearer Katniss not wanting kids was about the Reaping as opposed to some other reason.  At the end, it was clear Katniss was scared of Gale's reaction to the Peeta situation. I wasn't sure if the Capitol would actually have two victors - Katniss and Peeta played that very well. It was a great setup for things really getting interesting in the sequel.
Set in a post-apocalyptic future North America, this book is about one girl's fight to stay alive. 'The Hunger Games' is a yearly tournament in which the districts that make up the civilization known as Panem, have to send in representatives to compete to the death until one survives. Two children, a girl and a boy, from each district are sent to this tournament, where they are given minimal training and then thrown into a controlled arena surrounded by cameras for the whole country to see. It's reality tv on steroids. But unlike our reality tv, they aren't competing for personal gain. These kids have no choice, and the prize is a unusually generous amount of food for that District. You see, the districts are all under control by the Capitol, which rations (and withholds) food and resources to maintain control. The Hunger Games is a reminder to the districts that they are in power and must honor that power. The children who are chosen to compete are aptly called Tributes and it's supposed to be a honor to fight in the games, but as you can imagine it's terrifying and something to be mourned if you get chosen.  This book focuses on one Tribute in particular, Katniss, from district 12 and her journey through the tournament. Of course this isn't just about Katniss. We get to know the other district 12 Tribute, Peeta, and their mentor who survived a previous Hunger Game, as well as a host of other characters who either help prepare Katniss for the competition or who are competing with her. I won't say much more than that because what's so awesome about this book is that you really don't see what's coming. I had no idea what to expect going into it, half way through it I had no idea how it was going to end, and even at the end, I had no idea what could possibly be next, but I really really want to know. So thank goodness I started reading this after the trilogy was completed because there are two more books.  I really love the protagonist, Katniss, the most. She's a strong, smart, and tough girl, but she's emotionally retarded. We see this most in her budding relationship with her fellow Tribute, Peeta. That relationship in particular was a surprise for me as a reader because I thought this was just going to be about fighting, but there's romance, or at least a strong potential for romance. The writing style is very simplistic, but deceptively so. There are layers here and emotional complexity with subtle social commentary or rather observations that ring true to our own society and human nature in general. The narrative never comes across as preachy though. It's written in first person, and you really do feel like you're listening to Katniss' thoughts. There's also a lot of ambiguity that will leave you with mixed emotions - my favorite type of story. For those who may be put off by the premise and prospect of children killing children, I won't lie, it's brutal at times, but there are also moments of inspiring human kindness and sentimentality that will give you hope.
I picked this up to read once the movie was out, figuring I should find out what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed reading the book and found Katniss' character interesting, but overall I'm not blown away any particular aspect.  The story is set in some post-apocalyptic future where the Capitol rules over twelve districts. In the aftermath of a rebellion, the Capitol has established the Hunger Games, in which two teenagers from each district are chosen by lottery to fight to the death in a wilderness arena. We are told that the games are part punishment for the districts' rebellion. They are also televised, with all inhabitants of the districts being forced to watch select parts. This is also supposed to display the power of the Capitol. I didn't quite believe this reasoning, but just accepted it and read on.  Katniss has had a tough time after her father's death in the mines. When her mother became severely depressed, Katniss became the only source of food and goods for herself, her mother, and her younger sister. At the lottery for District Twelve, Katniss's sister is chosen to participate. Incapable of letting her sister go to a certain death, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  The majority of the book covers the preparation for the games and then follows Katniss' exploits in the arena, a mainly wooded wilderness. With her experience as an illicit hunter in her own district, Katniss quickly becomes one of the favorites in the competition. There are plot twists and other important characters - Peeta, the other participant from District Twelve, Rue, Cato, and Cinna.  I thought that parts of the ending were predictable, while one facet was not. I wish that some of the plot threads had been wrapped up better, but I am aware that there are two more books, so I expect that those problems will lead into the next book. I plan to see the movie and read the sequel, but I don't have any immediate need to plunge right into it. Overall - a good solid plot and protagonist, but I'm still puzzled as to why it has become so popular.
This is one of my favorite books, mainly because it's the start of a series that just impacts everything. This series is much more than what you think, or have been told the book represents. And for those out there who say that this is similar to Twilight... I will shank your big toe! I will note this up front, if you are reserve about which to see first the book or the movie, Definitely the Movie. The book beats the movie (as always) by a significant margin and changes a few things that tarnish the book.    Katniss Everdeen, this female character is one of the strongest fictional characters that I have read about to this date. In fact she's currently my second favorite character of all time (next to Tris Prior from Divergent by Veronica Roth). She has this femininity about her that draws you in and you feel her emotion, passion, and every decision and situation she makes. However, she as well has this dark side to her that makes her far more than just a girl/woman, which brought me in closer and wanting more. Great character!    This book about the games, is the beginning of probably one of the most notorious love triangles in young adult fictional books. I would like to note that I hate love triangles, they are dumb, complicated, and end up not being worth the time reading about. So... This one had my attention, I felt the emotion between Peeta, Gale, and Katniss, but at the same time the triangle didn't have the depth to it, it lacked something from Katniss or Gale. Like there was supposed to be a response, or just something that lingers in the back of your mind. It was a great triangle, made you tug to which one she should or shouldn't be with.    The buildup to the games was slow and boring, but I understood why it was needed. Without the training sessions and getting to know some of the other characters, there would be this disjointed feeling between the games and the characters in it. As well, one of the most prolific support characters wouldn't have had as much meaning as what she did.    The games were magnificent; there was a sense of fear around every branch, hidden in the background of the trees. I felt that the tributes were portrayed accurately, the fear and some of the enthusiasm and arrogance in some of them. When the games began, I felt the raw power and brutality that the games bring about. As well as the pain and how the relationships are changed and molded over and over throughout the games cycle.    The issue I had with this book was the other districts. I was left wondering about the people in the other districts and wanted to see more of them and what they did for a living. It was something that I felt left a gaping hole in the middle of the world building. In fact the entire world building is confined to the Capitol and District 12, so I feel safe to assume I'm right in questioning why none of the other districts were involved.
When a friend, who knows something of one's reading tastes, recommends a novel, that novel has instant "status" as one that is worthy of the time invested to read.  The friend who recommended this novel was most adamant that I read it.  So I bought it (and the second book in this series), read it and found that, if anything, the book was not commended highly enough.  So engaging was this futuristic work of fiction that I read it in less than three days.  Set in a future post civil war destroyed America, now known as "Panem," the story is narrated by, and told from the perspective of, Katniss Everdeen.  Katniss lives in District 12, the area responsible for producing the coal for the rest of the country, particularly for the Capital and which was once known as "Appalachia."  At 16, she has had to become the provider for her mother and younger sister after her father was killed in a mine explosion.  She does so by hunting and gathering "outside the fence" of her designated area.  To be caught doing so means  imprisonment at least and a slow, tortuous death at worst.  Spending the last four years honing her skills as an archer and hunter have prepared her to participate in the "Hunger Games," an annual event created by The Capital to remind the citizens of Panem of their tenuous hold on life and to punish them for rebelling decades before.  In these games, a male and a female, ages 12 to 18 are chosen (and are called "tributes") to represent their district in a contest against the other 11 district tributes.  The contest rules are simple, be the last one alive.  That person will receive wealth and luxury for the rest of their lives.  The majority of the book takes place, as expected, in the midst of "the Games."  There are moments of violence, of course, but they would be rated PG-13, there are no sexual moments but there is tension sufficient to make this a page turner.  While the book would be rated "PG-13," the movie, should it ever be made, will be a definite "R," as there would be no way to portray teenagers killing each other, or be seen in the clothing Ms. Collins has the characters dressed in at points in the tale, that could be rated less.  This is a Young Adult novel.  The Hunger Games is an opportunity to consider contemporary society.  The "have nots" must labor incessantly, disregarding the personal cost, for the benefit of the faceless "haves" in a distant Capital that provides nothing but grief and demands upon its subjects.  The destruction that caused these Games to occur is of the citizen's own doing, the Capital had more resources and thus won the war but the Capital was created by the citizenry before the war.  There is much reflection of present America in this tale.  The things that are occurring within our world are of our own creation, the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" is widening, and the Government is seen to be responsible for the woes that are present in our lives.  Katniss is a reminder that the individual still has choices to make, can be the cause for hope and has the opportunity to be defined in their own terms.  To quote a past president, "there is nothing wrong with America that cannot be fixed by what his right with America."  We, as a nation, have many struggles ahead of us, problems that must be solved that will require sacrifice and commitment and only each other to depend upon to see each of us survive.  We, as a nation, can play "The Hunger Games" and strive to be the last one standing.  The winner of that game will rule over a lonely, desolate, wasteland that will not be worth the cost it took to conquer.  Or, as a nation, we can commit that we can work together to accomplish what one alone, or smaller groups, cannot.  The winner(s) in that game will witness a world that is safer, connected, fertile and worth passing along to our descendants.
I only heard about this book when the movie came out and since it exploded so abruptly onto the book scene, I borrowed it from a friend to read.  Overall, I thought it was just--okay. I didn't really see what the fuss was about. While certainly better than some garbage on the market (Twilight) and an interesting premise--I found it lacking in real characterization.  Katniss is mostly just okay. I have only read the first book--and I heard that she wimps out in the last two--which is disappointing, if that's true. She is fairly realistic about her chances. Sometimes her 'hostile' attitudes seem extremely forced--like the Author was extremely emphatic on creating an anti-Bella. But she's also fairly tough and self-reliant, which I really liked in a female lead.  Unfortunately, I can smell a love triangle from a mile away so I just tried to ignore Gale and Peeta's sissy attitudes when it comes to whether or not Katniss 'meant' any of the act that she and Peeta were putting on during the games. Like, really you two? That's what you're worried about? Life or death situation, you morons. There are more important things out there.  The Games themselves--I thought the brutality was undercut by the Peeta/Katniss act going on. Basically everyone except Districts 11 and 12 are portrayed are barbarous bloody-thirsty animals. But Katniss mourns and adorns Rue with flowers, but leaves Foxface (who never did anything to anyone, except be really smart and avoid everything). The love story, to me, was kind of unnecessary--but I guess this is marketed to young teens.  I was also thinking the entire time--about why on earth the districts allow this to go on. I have heard that this is addressed in the other two books--but just in the first one, it seems so weird that the adults don't rise up to protect their children like they should be.  One thing I did REALLY love---was the contrast set up between the Capital and the outer districts. That was cool. I liked that a lot.  Of course, there is also the inevitable Battle Royale comparison--a Japanese novel with a similar story--though much more thought out and I would say, more brutal. Also a good deal more characterization--so that you actually give a crap or are interested in some of the characters.  I shouldn't sound so sour--I did like the book. I thought it was an interesting quick read. Took me just a couple hours to get through it--I just recently saw the movie so I'm thinking about reading the last two, which might change my mind. So its okay, definitely worth a look if you've never read Battle Royale. But it has kind of the "Author's First Published Book" tang to it. The writing is kind of shaky, a little clumsy, characterizations are sometimes inconsistent but maybe those improve through the books? I hope so, cause its an interesting premise.
The Hunger Games has probably been the most popular series since Twilight and Harry Potter. It's hard not to hear what people are saying about them at this point. A lot of people think their just an excuse to write about kids killing kids. A chance to spin a love triangle for another "silly YA romance." In all honesty the reason I've put off reading them is simply because popular books usually tend to let me down. Well I can definitely say this book is an exception.  The world that The Hunger Games takes place is a futuristic look where the USA no longer exists, the land is different now, Panem is the new power. The Capital runs the country and the people of the 12 districts are ruthlessly controlled. Starvation is a common thing to die from and people rarely make it to old age. Once a year two children of each sex is drawn to participate in The Hunger Games, where they will fight to the death. The Capitals reminder that rebellion against them is futile and that the people should be grateful to have such a government.  HG is a shocking look into the type of government system that every human fears. Where one wrong word or action could be taken as rebellion against the government, when it was only an act of survival. It's amazing hearing the indifference of the Capital population about the slaughter of innocents, kids between the ages 12-18. The world is well thought out and a cold slap. One that I thick every reader should experience.  Even though Collins first entry into the series is small and her writing style simple, everything is felt. Every time Katniss avoided death I was their experiencing it, I could believe in her no nonsense character. Each character comes across exactly as the author painted them, caring, frivolous, loving, scary, deadly, and sad. What's more is the love triangle in her is phenomenal. Katniss is girl who doesn't want love or the consequences of bringing a child into such a horrible world. Love is nothing she's pondered about, she has more important things to worry about such as keeping her family alive and fed. This causes the love story to become enchanting as it creeps up on Katniss.  The Hunger Games is well worth all the buzz. It's raw and haunting, leaving readers to ponder the story long after they've read that last page. The romance is beautiful and subtle--and I can count on one hand how many love triangles I've read that I can actually say felt real, and I wanted to continue. The first book sparks a fire within to see the Capital fall and the people freed--rebellion. This book played so well with my emotions I know that I'll follow this series to whatever end.  Sexual Content: Some kissing and stuff. There's a lot of human cruelty in here.  4/5- Great! Really enjoyed it  Originally reviewed at Book Whispers.
Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games (Scholastic Press, 2008)  Okay, so, yeah. I guess I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. And honestly, when it comes to YA series with fuss these days, I pretty much expect to be disappointed, as they range from the mediocre (Harry Potter) to the downright awful (Twilight). So in that respect, I have to admit I was kind of pleasantly surprised by The Hunger Games, the first book of Suzanne Collins' trilogy about Katniss Everdeen's adventures in some sort of post-war society (we're not given details about what happened to the world in this first novel). On the other hand, it's kind of Battle Royale lite, and given what a fan I am of Takami Koushun's novel, I was kind of disappointed in that regard. That said, there are a lot of pretty durned good books that are based on other books (Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres, of course, is a direct descendant of King Lear, for example), so I'm not going to ding it too hard for that, despite Collins' insistence that she was entirely unaware of Koushun's novel (or the smash-hit cult film based on it).  Plot: Katniss Everdeen is sixteen years old, living on the fringes of District 12 in the continent of Panem, a post-apocalyptic North America (District 12 corresponds in modern geography to the Appalachians; basically, Katniss is from Kentucky/West Virginia/somewhere in there). She and her best friend spend their days slipping the fences that separate the "civilized" parts of society from the wilds, hunting the beasts that the fences are designed to keep out, and selling the meat on the black market. Despite the illegality of her way of making a living and the stigma attached to her family since her mother, once a noted herbalist, went insane following the death of her husband, Katniss is a popular figure in District 12. The year's selection contest for the Hunger Games is coming up, and this is the last year Katniss is eligible; one more year and she can breathe a sigh of relief. On the other hand, her sister Primrose is old enough to be eligible for the first time...and when the selection comes around, inevitably, Primrose is chosen. Katniss steps up in her place and joins Peeta Malark, the son of the local baker, as the tribute from District 12.  Then come the games themselves, and if you've read Battle Royale or any of the other pieces of literature that pursue this same line of thinking, you know what's going to happen: everyone gets tossed into an arena, and everyone fights until there's only one person left. It's an inherently interesting concept, as long as the author is capable of building solid, three-dimensional minor characters. Collins is, though perhaps she's not as good as Koushun (and this, by the by, is where the film adaptation of Battle Royale fails; we lack a sense of many of the minor competitors). But we get to know Katniss and Peeta's opponents without the team ever conversing with them, through Katniss' keen sense of observation; she finds unexpected allies in interesting places, expected enemies in even more interesting places, and comes to realize that she's not the only cunning contestant to be found on the grounds. Overall, we've got a bunch of interesting characters in an interesting situation, well-written enough to keep the suspense ratcheted up without the whole b ook deflating when we pause briefly once in a while to advance the are-they-or-aren't-they? romance subplot between Katniss and Peeta (unfortunately the book's weak spot; it advances rigorously along old-Harlequin-formula-romance-novel lines).  While writing this review, I've actually talked myself into revising my initial rating upwards a bit; I realized some stuff about it I didn't while I was originally reading the novel. It's a nifty little thing, perhaps not as deserving of the incredible amount of hype as it could have been, but certainly not a disappointment in most ways. It's good enough to make me look forward to reading the other two novels in the trilogy. ***
The book is well written and very innovative. It is very clear to see why this book has become so insanely popular over the last few years. However I was expecting something completely different. I thought the book would be more focused on the actual Hunger Games but *SEMI-SPOILER* it becomes too entangled with a love story. It almost felt, dare I say it, too Twilight-ish. What appeared to be a side love story became the focus of the entire book. It felt as if Collins had changed her mind about what to make of this book about halfway through. The first half of the book is really detailed about life in the Districts, the history behind the Hunger Games, etc. It was pretty interesting stuff. Even the beginning of the Games were pretty well written and intriguing. Once the Games had been going for a while, however, it felt as if Collins decided to reroute the story line and the fact-driven, detail-oriented plot which existed in the first half, disappeared. Some parasitic love story began to consume the once great story. Towards the end it becomes really apparent where entire chunks of time, in what should be a strange land to Katniss, are just forgotten due to her new-found love sickness/obsession. Even though that is a viable reason, the girl is living in poverty at the beginning of the book and at the end she is living the most luxurious of lifestyles YET the only thing she can focus on is some boy from the town which she grew up. Seriously? If I was piss poor one day and suddenly living the life of Donald Trump, I'm pretty sure my love sickness for some chump I grew up with yet never did anything about would subside.  Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good love story but the huge focus change really turned me off to the plot. I'm sure my teenage self would have loved it with it's half action/half love story, simple plot, and a teenage angst would have been an instant classic with me. But now I wish it would have focused more on the Games.  Overall, if you have a few hours and a few bucks, go for it. In the end everyone's opinion is different. Plus, what harm could come from reading more?
"The time has come to select a courageous young man and woman  to participate in this year's Hunger Games"~Effie Trinket  "Let the 74th Annual Hunger Games Begin!"~Caesar Flickerman  The Hunger Games Trilogy takes place in post-apocalyptic North America, now known as Panem. The government requires one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen from each of the twelve districts to act as "tributes" in the annual Hunger Games (a televised fight to the death where the lone victor becomes rich).  Characters  Katniss Everdeen becomes District 12's female tribute and has to fight to survive not just for herself, but also for her family. Peeta Mellark is the male tribute from District 12 and he has a few secrets he's never told Katniss. Haymitch Abernathy, District 12's only victor who spends his life at the bottom of a bottle, is Katniss and Peeta's mentor and their lifeline. Haymitch, along with Effie the escort, Cinna and Portia (the stylists) help Katniss and Peeta make a lasting impression on the potential sponsors who could very well save their lives in the arena. At home, while Katniss and Peeta are in the Capitol and the Arena, Katniss' friend Gale helps her mother and little sister, Prim(rose) as they are forced to watch the Games on TV.  The Tributes from each of the 12 Districts (24 kids) are taken to the luxurious Capitol where they are paraded around, interviewed, and trained for the nation-wide televised fight to the death. Getting sponsors and survival are the only things that can save the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, if she wishes to survive and continue to feed and protect her family. Dying is not an option for her.  Movie  Some people didn't like the movie. When I first saw it, I loved it. However, as I've watched it several more times, I've become increasingly dissatisfied. Not because of what they cut out (which was a lot, including certain things I think needed to be included) but with how the director, Gary Ross, filmed the movie. He used a handheld camera to show "subjectivity" because he felt if he used normal filming techniques with stable wide-angle lenses, movie audiences would become like  the flamboyant and ignorant citizens of "the Capitol" watching The Hunger Games, instead of understanding fans of Suzanne Collins' visceral book. I understand his thinking, but I still wish the screen didn't shake every two seconds making some people experience vertigo rather than watching the movie.  Other Notes  I highly recommend this trilogy, I read all three books in 9 hours and stayed up until 2 in the morning reading it last Thanksgiving, and it certainly made me grateful that I didn't live in Panem. I suggest everyone stops reading this and buy The Hunger Games already! Then, when you're done with the Trilogy (however long that takes you), I'd also check out Divergent and Insurgent by Veronica Roth.  To read more of my book reviews, please go to [...]
"The Hunger Games" is the explosive first book in Suzanne Collins' post-apocalyptic trilogy. Katniss Everdeen, the novel's sixteen-year-old heroine, has grown up in what was formerly North America but which is now referred to as Panem, a socialistic culture consisting of twelve districts run by the privileged residents of the Capitol. Because of a quelled uprising by the now-extinct thirteenth district, one boy and one girl tribute between the ages of 12 and 18 must be offered each year to compete in the eponymous tournament. Names are drawn in a lottery to determine who will become the designated contenders, and they must fight to the death as the event is publicly broadcast until only one of the twenty-four remains. When Katniss' younger sister Primrose is chosen for district twelve, Katniss volunteers to go in her place along with Peeta Mellark, the boy tribute. After preparation and training at the Capitol, the tributes are taken to a remote location and the Hunger Games begins. As each day passes, survival seems less likely amid threats by not only their opponents but also the overseers at the Capitol, who are able to control the contest's various elements. Relationships are formed and broken as the tributes dwindle, and the outcome is different and more consequential than anyone could have imagined.  Although intended for young adult audiences, this novel reads like adult literature and will appeal to a large reading public. Despite its dark and somber nature, "The Hunger Games" demonstrates that while adverse outcomes and seemingly impossible odds can bring out the worst in people, some human instincts never die. As for readers, odds are that if you choose to embark on this journey, you won't be able to resist the second and third books in the trilogy!
Having seen this book everywhere, and being dimly aware that they already made the movie (I generally don't watch movies), I guess I figured I better find out what the fuss was about.  I'm a little slow on the uptake of popular culture sometimes.  What I found is that much of the praise is quite warranted.  Some authors just know how to tell a story.  If I could make a recommendation, I would save this book until such a time as you need to effortlessly occupy several hours.  If you open it at bedtime you might end up reading until the wee hours.  The criticism I have is that it doesn't seem like the magnitude of the moral or psychological horror of the games, or the Capitol, is ever expressed by the characters. Maybe that's what happens after several generations over which the hopeless cruelty of the games, and the incessant oppression and exploitation by the Capitol, just obliterates any sense of moral outrage.  I kept expecting Katniss, or someone...anyone, to rage some.  I kept expecting a more thorough examination of the moral dilemma (kill an innocent or become a dead innocent).  The premise is absolutely brutal, and the real human response to such brutality remains unexplored.  Another disappointment is that Katniss is the only character.  Everyone else is just a foil, mirror, or echoing surface off of which bounces.  Haymitch, for example, could be an excellent character.  There seems to be more to Cinna than meets the eye.  Maybe this is all being set up for the next books in the series, I don't know.  Maybe one is asking for too much from a supposed young-adult novel.  In conclusion, we have an excellent piece of entertainment, which maybe could have been a moving piece of literature.
In the book Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins develops an adventurous journey that leads through a powerful, but difficult time to survive and win for their district. Collins creates an interesting feel because even though it is fight to the death, there are other aspects to the book. She invents romance, action, and real world issues that are occurred to this day. The book makes us think about life lessons that we normal teens might not think about from day-to-day. Would you kill someone if it was a choice between murder and your own death? How can people survive when all the odds are stacked against them? Suzanne explains this by creating a world of poverty and hunger; the parents of the young gladiators are so beaten down and afraid of the totalitarian regime that they just hug their kids and pray to have food on the table. Every time I eat, I always think about the children, especially Prim, whose begging and dying for food. I have developed a whole new respect for starving children, who are fortunate like me. The Hunger Games is the best book I have ever read through my ten years of reading.  The Hunger Games takes place in a nation known as Panem, established in North America after the destruction of the continent's civilization by an unknown apocalyptic event. The nation consists of the wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding, poorer districts united under the Capitol's control. District 12, where the book begins, is located in the coal-rich region that was formerly known as Appalachia. As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol, in which a 13th district was destroyed, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the tributes must fight to the death in an outdoor arena controlled by the Capitol, until only one individual remains. The male tribute Peeta Mellark and the volunteer Katniss Everdeen begin their journey together, while they say goodbye to their families for possibly the last time. Together they use each other, their knowledge, their resources, and other tributes to kill the dangers of Katniss and Peeta to their advantage.  The character Cinna, reminds me of the show Project Runway. He uses the same fashion techniques as the show Project Runway. Cinna creates that impressive visual aspect of creative clothing and make-up techniques. Cinna also reminds me of Tyra Banks. They both know high fashion and know have to make others look amazingly beautiful. On the other hand the overall book reminds me of the series Twilight. They both endure violence and romance of one other. Peeta and Gale have a thing for Katniss, while Bella and Edward have romantic relationship.  Epiphany is a character's sudden realization of a truth in a work of literature. This novel has many important epiphanies that change the course of the plot. The most vital epiphany for Katniss came was when Rue died and she suddenly understood what Peeta meant about being "more than just a piece in their Games" (Collins 236). This is when she truly decides to fight against the Capitol. I think this revelation is what will drive her throughout the series.  Another example of epiphany is when Katniss discovers that she and Peeta have a similar goal, so they are truly connected. They work as a team and care for each other when they are hurt or trying to kill the other tributes.  Another major literary element in The Hunger Games is symbolism. The mocking jay pin is the circular gold token Katniss wears during the Games to represent District 12. Each tribute is allowed one item to remind them of their friends and family in their home district; the small pin bearing the image of a bird in flight is Katniss's. The mocking jay pin was originally given to Katniss by the mayor's daughter, before Katniss's departure to the Capitol to participate in the Hunger Games. Though Katniss forgets about the pin during her training sessions, Cinna is sure to place the mocking jay prominently on Katniss's outfit for the arena. He tells her that the little pin "barely cleared the review board" since the authorities thought Katniss might be able to use the pin as a weapon (Collins 78). While the thought of a tiny little pin being used as a weapon might seem silly to us, but as we will find out, it is indeed an incredibly powerful and important weapon.  In general the novel is written for any gender and it a young adult series. The book stars a boy and a girl and involves hunting, deaths, romance, fighting, and life lessons. I would say the age range should be 11 and up. I feel at the age of 11, they can comprehend a level like this book, and take the full meaning of The Hunger Games to full heart. Also younger people under 11 shouldn't read the book because it may be inappropriate for them. The violence and romance can be too much for them to read and deal with. I would highly recommend using this age limit and you will see why it can be inappropriate and too graphic for the child's mind.  I had heard this was a great book so I bought it with high expectations. It's so interesting that a book targeted for young adults has all teenagers as main characters. I'm usually not a big fan of fantasy novel, but this one I couldn't put down. The violence was strong for a young-adult book and I thought it was great nonetheless. I understand the setting is in a semi-post apocalypse, but does the author really believe human nature to be that bad? It put me into perspective for quite a while. Overall the book was breathtaking and inspiring to me. I 100% recommend the novel, The Hunger Games!!!  By: Ashley Colaizzi
I decided to read this book before seeing the movie. Also it was recommended by my older brother and sister in law after they gave me a kindle for Christmas. I was expecting a Battle Royale type of copycat story but was surprised to that the story and the fights were nothing to that level of violence.  I'll start with my one and only major complaint: the author uses "says" almost 98% of the time when anyone speaks! This is point when you use the character's words to describe what they are feeling or going through at that moment. Even if the whole story is done through Katniss` point of view, this one thing could have helped flesh out the scenes and emotions of the character's and also give them sense of movement.  My only minor complaint is the lack of detail or some background about the Capitol. Again, even though this is all Katniss view of the world it would have really set up the Capitol as the true enemy of everyone. From all the technology they have to medicines and just living comfortable off the backs of the weaker Districts and how they obviously cheat by raising and training Tributes, which is against their rules. I figure the next two books will elaborate of this.  Just those two things brought it down from a five star rating that it could have gotten. It is a very enjoyable read and the pace is really well set. It moves from really slow moments that catch off guard as something suddenly and unexpected happens out of no where, just to slow down again to set you up for something worse.  This is a fast read because of the way it is written. Everything is from one person's perspecive and sometimes leaves you wonder what might be going through the personas in the book. You learn who Katniss is but wonder about those around her. The language is pretty simple at best which also contributes to the fast read. Since this is set in a ruined America the terms and references to locations that have changed are easy to imagine.  I do recommend this book to teenage readers and to adults who want a good read that moves along well.
The Hunger games is part of a trilogy.  Despite the fact it is clearly written as such (the following books not an after-thought but an essential part of a whole work), it also stands on its own.  It provides an incredibly compelling story.  The model of a post-apocalyptic capital exploiting the people and resources of fragmented societies held in check by military force and, importantly, by the "games" seems other-worldly until upon reflection it is more like status quo than I'd like to admit.  The sheer brutality of it all, not only of the Games but in the way the government exercises control over the outlier states, is brilliantly glossed over by the government.  The parallels to present day are all too clear.  This book is a classic anti-utopia.  Ironically, the weakness may be the description of the Games themselves, where aspects seemed strained in the description.  Part of this is the first-person perspective of the book: only those things evident to Katniss can be described.  The subsequent film, which was remarkably loyal to the book, was liberated from this restriction and was able to show more.  On the other hand, the film by necessity simplified some things, yielding a hurried aspect to the Games there which the book doesn't share.  While I really enjoyed this book , when I compare it to some of the greats of the anti-utopian genre, for example Lord Of the Flies comes to mind, the writing seems to fall a bit short.  But I don't want to sell it short: I strongly recommend The Hunger Games, especially if you haven't yet seen the film.  But if you have seen the film, you owe it to yourself to read the original, especially since the first-person narrative is much more intimate with Katniss's thoughts and perceptions.
I have read many of the reviews on the Hunger Games series. I agree with many and not so much with others ... but that's the great thing about book discussions. Gaining different perspective from others can often make us open our minds to things in ways we never thought of. One reviewer wrote that Hunger Games is not a new idea but rather just a retelling of Battle Royal. Well, I have a theory on this, and I will keep it simple. As a musician, we often hear "there are no more original ideas, it's how you play the music". I think the same can be said for almost any book as well. It is all in the way you tell the story ...    Hunger Games, WOW! Could there be a more mind-blowing concept for a story! I found myself torn between what Suzanne Collins was trying to take a jab at (in a good way). Was she poking at society? Was she poking at the media? Was she poking about classes and segregation? Was she making a point about bad fashion? Was she making a point of it all? Absolutely brilliant writing ... I don't care what anyone else says! I was engulfed in the story from the first chapter of book one and could not put it down. I read all three books in one week. AH-MAZE-ING story telling! Thank you Suzanne!!    Could there be a more deliciously brutal and screwed up world? The facts are simple, and so so so awfully intriguing! To sum it up ... greed destroyed the world, to survive they divided it into 13 poverty stricken districts to which each provide a resource that is delivered to the rich and glutenous Capitol, District 13 fights back and is squashed by the Capitol, as punishment each district must give up one boy and one girl between ages 12 and 18 to fight to the death as a reminder to know their place in society .... and the whole thing is televised ENTERTAINMENT for the Capitol. And that is just the tip of this very complex iceberg. The further you dig the more substance you find. Suzanne Collins is an EXCELLENT story teller.  Hunger Games - as mentioned above, is an excellently twisted tale with adventure, love triangle, intrigue and deception. The characters will suck you in and make you love them! The love triangle will keep you guessing (and hoping)! The action will keep you on the edge of your seat! The atrocity will piss you off! Rue will make you bawl your eyes out! And I can promise you that when the ending rolls around you will absolutely rush out to get that second book!!  **One thing I want to strongly advise here! If you saw the movie, do yourself a favor and READ THE BOOK!! Suzanne Collins had to cry with the final cut of the movie. While I think the actors did a wonderful job, the director did not do a good job of telling the story ... he missed the entire point and feel of the books completely! Please, read the books! The movie does not do them justice.**    Normally my reviews are full of spoilers. This time however, I did my best to leave as much out as possible. I didn't want to ruin a thing! It is rare that I give anything 5 stars (whether I write the review or rate it in my head). The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins is by far one of the best series I have read in 2012! I can not recommend it high enough! If you like action, emotion, love triangles, dystopia, excellent character development, and excellent story telling ... then this is YOUR story! Stop reading my review and go read the book already! I promise you, it will not disappoint!  ~*~ Rhea
The Hunger Games will leave you hanging in this science fiction thriller. Suzanne Collins has written another great book. This chronological book is filled with death and survival. This book didn't let me stop reading. "You never forget the face of your last hope," says Suzanne Collins. Collins has written an eye-popping, suspenseful book. She will have you asking for more. The Hunger Games sold more than 36.5 million copies in the U.S.    The Hunger Games takes place in an exciting future in North America. This is exciting because the author describes it so beautifully that I feel like I am actually in the story. The plot is very exciting because Collins describes it very well that I couldn't put the book down. The tributes get picked in a lottery by the Capitol to see who competes in The Hunger Games. 24 kids go into war as a punishment for their ancestors rebelling against the Capitol's government. They have to fight and survive on their own in a playing field that takes place in the wilderness. Collins keeps you on the edge of your seat as you read along. The tributes are a huge part of the story. I can really relate to some of them because of their feelings and attitudes. The main character is a 16 year old girl named Katniss and she volunteers as tribute for her younger sister Primrose after she got picked in the lottery. The other main character is Peeta. He is the male tribute to fight in District 12. I feel I can relate to Katniss because I would be scared if any of my younger sisters got picked to fight in a war.   Suzanne Collins uses vivid words about where the tributes are. An example is "I ran through the shady parts of the woods." She gives each character a different look and personality. For example, "He is disgusting, but I am grateful." She uses great language to strengthen the text by using similes. An example is "She was as calm as a river." I think this author was successful because the story was so beautifully written that I couldn't put the book down. "I couldn't stop reading," says Stephan King. "Engaging, brutal but engaging," says anonymous. This book made me feel sad because all of the kids were fighting and killing each other. I also felt amazed because of the courage Katniss and Peeta showed when they got picked to fight in The Hunger Games.   If you liked The Hunger Games then you might like Gregor the Overlander. You will like this because it is by the same author. You will also like this because it is a fantasy page turner. You will also like this because it is an adventurist nail bitter. Also it will pull at your heart strings as you keep reading. You will love all Suzanne Collins books. You will like The Hunger Games because it was very well written. You will really like this book because it is science-fiction and takes place in a breathtaking future. You will very much like this book because it is filled with death, survival, and romance.
" Happy Hunger Games , And may the odds be ever in your favor. "    I read the  fantastic Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. In this death defying Sci Fi story  the true theme of the story is survival and keeping your humanity and dignity as you try to  survive. I wonder if as your trying to survive you think ,will I survive ,  what will become of me. I believe Suzanne Collins will have every reader who reads this book on their edge of their seats. I hope readers will find the  Hunger Games  heart tugging , and inspirational.    The Hunger Games take place in a poor town called Panem. The plot  explains the importance of survival and striving for  life. The characters are all different , and they all seem to have different  traits from one another, probably because of all their different experiences. I hope I see the characters grow more in the novel because they have grown a lot ,but I want more change from  them it would make me more satisfied. Suzanne Collins really used beautiful language when finding the main idea of the story. An  example is when she wrote , two people named Katniss and Peeta fighting for survival  against 22 other people from other districts . The main idea  is each year one  boy and one  girl are  chosen from each district to fight to the death. If your name is picked you must go and fight till their is only one person left. The whole idea behind the whole things is for peoples entertainment that is why they program it on tv so people will watch it , and the capital a lot of money from it. . The story has a  one big meaning,  people will fight for what they want most , survival.    In an amazing review on amazon.com by E.R. Bird on the  famous  Hunger Games. She writes "  Your story often rests on the shoulders of the protagonist . " , " Is this a believable character ? " , " Do you root for him or her ? " ,  " Because basically it is a very hard thing to create a " good " person on the page that your reader is going to fall in love with . "After reading  this amazing review . I believe the reviewer sees the Hunger Games in  a different way then anyone else does because they give you a great amount of a good glimpse , and what it really means. The reviewer stated " Author's Craft can relate to having fun adventures involving a boy , his sister and a world beneath our world . " For a quote from a reviewer I went on goodeads.com , and I found a great quote " You don't forget the face of the person who was your last hope . " I believe this describes the Hunger Games amazingly because it tells you the truth of the Hunger Games . Thank you to amazon.com and goodreads.com for letting me use their resources for this paragraph.    Well to the closing of my book review I've decided to share with you 3 books that you will love just as much as the Hunger Games. My first book is Tum Tum , and Nutmeg. In my favorite novel ever,  two unordinary mice live exactly like people in a small area called Rose Cottage in a  broom cupboard  , and the journeys they have will amaze you. In this greet book by Emily Bearns it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat.  Another great story is Beryl , A Pigs Tale. In this amazing story it  takes place at two different places a  commercial warehouse , and in the woods. Beryl is a young pig who has been separated from her parents and is in search of them. The  interesting part of the book is the pigs can talk. Jane Simmons will definitely have you begging for more. My final , and third book is The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz by  L. Frank Baum will definitely have you hungry for more  . In this amazing story that takes place in Kansas and The Land Of Oz a young girl named Dorothy gets trapped in a tornado and is blown off to an unknown place called The Land Of Oz  where strange things can talk , and there are good witches  ,and bad witches . Dorothy the young girl will definitely get you going. Well thats it for now ,but thank you so much for reading. Remember " May the odds be ever in in you favor . "
"The rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over the period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins," {suzanne collins}.  {my thoughts} - I really enjoyed this book for a number of reasons.  {part one} - This book isn't what I had originally assumed even though I had gotten a lot of insight about it from a friend. It has in fact exceeded my expectations. It follows the journey of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark as they are chosen as players {tributes} in the Hunger Games. They are from District 12 which is one of the poorest in the country and based on the description within the book it reminds me of the {great depression { only through a more futuristic type of stand point.  {part two} - This part consisted of a lot of trial and error as well as some emotion. Along with all of that came a lot of destruction as well as death and determination to survive against all odds. The players within the arena have learned that the quickest way to eliminate some of the other players is by joining forces and then eliminating their allies when they are no longer of any use. This part ended with a new rule being announced that added a nice twist to the storyline.  {part three} - The end of the book which was based on survival and cunning manipulation in my honest opinion. It also embarks on the journey of rebellion towards the Capitol that is in charge of these Hunger Games which shows that it is possible to "stick it to the man" if you have enough determination and the cunning ability to outsmart them.  In the end the characters had out smarted the government in which I believe to be completely justified given that I view the Hunger Games as Barbaric and unnecessary evil. I understand the government's desire to show that they are still in control and can still force it's citizens to bend at their beckon call but I don't believe that brutal murder between teenagers as a form of entertainment is worth the risk of another up-rise within the districts against the Capitol.  {reason for reading} - Everyone was talking about it so I had to see what all the hype was about.
So, after much persistence from my teenage friends (yes, I have some) I finally buckled and read `The Hunger Games'.  To be honest, it actually took an adult friend (mother to a teenager) to get me to do it.  She read the book after her kid did and told me that it was much better than she expected and that I'd really like it.  Coming down from some heavier reading, I like to mix things up with some light fare to balance out the weight and so I gave it a go.  I want to start by saying that anyone who comes here to merely bash at the idea of children killing children really has no grounds to do so since they read the book wholly aware of the contents.  If you can justify reading the book knowing that you will be reading about children between the ages of 12-18 fighting to the death in gladiatorial like matches then you can't complain about the subject matter.  Sure, I'm not sure why there is this cultural fascination with youths engaging in mortal combat, but I can no longer take a stand against it since I was sucked into it and actually read this thing.  Seriously though, as mature as the subject (I'm not sure I think twelve year olds should be reading this), this book is a decent read.  The Hunger Games referred to in the books title is a televised event where tributes from different colonies in a post-apocalyptic United States fight to the death for honor, wealth and food rations.  The tributes are chosen at random and there are two per colony, resulting in twenty-four tributes ranging from 12-18 who will hunt and kill one another during the course of however many days it takes.  They are dropped off in a manufactured environment with limited resources and they are watched by the world (many of whom are placing bets on who will win).  This is a game, a sport, much like the gladiatorial events in ancient Rome.  `The Hunger Games' centers on Katniss, a young woman who is the sole caretaker for her family after her father died in the mines and her mother basically retreated into herself.  When Katniss's twelve year-old sister is chosen for the games, Katniss offers herself in her place and then prepares herself for battle.  Katniss is smart and skilled, but there is more at stake than her life.  First thing to be noted is that the book is a very easy read.  I read it in about three days.  The pages just breeze by, and the plot is very interesting and easy to follow, which was nice.  The character development is a tad formulaic, but it doesn't really matter.  The writing leaves a lot to be desired though.  I'm not a fan of these Young Adult novels mainly because the writing can be lazy in parts, and Collins doesn't escape that trap.  Still, it is a surprisingly captivating read.  I didn't really care for some of the later developments (the dogs in particular) which took away from the earthier and realistic tone the book was taking.  I will say that the violence level was less than I expected (I was under the impression this was a bloodbath) but more than I think is appropriate for youngsters.  Taking out the fact that you have sixteen year-olds tossing spears through twelve year-olds, the violence in general regardless of the age of those doing the killing is too intense for a twelve year-old to read.  I'm kind of shocked that parents are OK with this (my friends included).  Following Katniss, who refrains from killing the best she can, a lot of the violence is done `off screen' so-to-speak, so that is a plus.  Collins really is taking a jab at the media here, with their current fascination with `reality television' and she does so rather effectively.  One can read this without feeling as though they are being preached to and yet get the message loud and clear.  I'll be reading the other books in the series, since I can't stop at one.  All reservations aside, this was a far better read than I expected it to be.
this book is one of my favorites, this book will blow your mind I enjoyed reading Katniss and Peeta's story.  Plot  Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen has been providing for her family since her father's death in a mining accident. She has done this by illegally hunting beyond the boundaries of District 12 and using the game she kills for food or for barter. Through her skill with a bow and her ability to track and snare rabbits and squirrels, her family has been able to survive.  They have also survived because Katniss signs up for the tessera, a ration of grain that is given in exchange for placing your name in the lottery for the reaping, the ceremony that determines who will be the district's representative in the Games. Everyone's name goes in the lottery from the time they reach the age of 12 until they turn 18. Each time Katniss exchanges her name for the tessera, her chances of being the one whose name is called increase. Only it isn't her name that is called. It is her sister's.  Prim Everdeen is the one person that Katniss loves above all others. She is only 12, quiet, loving and on her way to being a healer. She would not be able to survive the reaping and Katniss knows this. When Prim's name is called, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place as a tribute from District 12 to the Hunger Games.  Katniss knows that it is not only her own life on the line in the games, but that others will benefit as well if she is the victor and her skills as a hunter will give her an edge in the Games. But her life as a tribute becomes more complicated by the other tribute from District 12. Peeta Mellark, the baker's son, is a boy that Katniss thinks she owes a favor to because of a kindness that he showed her when she was most desperate and her family's survival was at stake. And Katniss knows that now her survival will mean his death.
I decided to read The Hunger Games for obvious reasons...because everyone else was doing it, of course!  I wasn't really sure what to expect, but to my surprise I fell in love.  I love love love this book.  Yes, it's a young adult book and, yes, I am an adult.  But I don't care!  The novel is written maturely and in a way which any reader of any age can (and will) enjoy it.  Although Collins clearly intended  the book for young adult/teenage audiences, it is very enjoyable for any age and any gender.  My fiancé (male) loved it, my mother (late 50s) loved it, my sister (mid-30s) loved it, and I loved it!  The novel is narrated by a 16-year-old girl named Katniss.  Although she is only 16, Katniss is mature beyond her years.  This maturity is a result of her father's death and her mother's inability to cope with the loss of her husband.  Katniss, therefore, has no choice but to take on the motherly role in the household and take care of her mother, her younger sister Prim, and herself.  Due to this role, Katniss becomes very protective of her sister, even so much so that Prim does not get the chance to mature as much as maybe she should in this distopian world.  The children need to be prepared for the possibility of their name being drawn once every year, in which they begin the journey of the Hunger Games.  The Games were created by the powerful Capitol as a reminder not to create an uprising and to just follow orders from the Capitol.  In the Games, there is only one survivor out of 24 kids aged 11-18!  Turns out that Prim is chosen this year, but Katniss (holy crap!) steps in as her replacement.  The reader is then taken through the terrifying journey of Katniss to and inside the Games.  The novel is very creative and takes the reader on a journey through many emotions, including fear, depression, anxiety, happiness, hope, and anger.  I very much enjoyed the characters throughout the story.  Katniss...oh, how I adore you!  I admire this 16-year-old character for so many reasons.  She is very courageous and so strong throughout all the horrible things she must go through in her journey.  Peeta, of course, is endearing.  Peeta is a 16-year-old boy who has also had his name drawn to compete in the Hunger Games this year.  We discover that this boy is going to be challenging for Katniss to bring herself to eventually kill (if she is to survive) because he pretty much saved her life when they were younger.  And Gale (an 18-year-old boy who is best friends with Katniss) is Katniss's rock, and how can you not love a rock?  The love triangle, however, is a bit cliché for my liking.  I still have reservations about the fact that 13-year-old kids are reading this book in school.  Kids reading about kids killing kids...strange...  Another element that I found interesting and pretty dead-on was Collins's underlying comments (or, at least, what I think she was commenting) on today's society.  In today's popular culture, so many of us are enveloped in watching reality television shows of all different types and genres.  So, if there was really a hunger games in real life, would people watch it and cheer for and sponsor certain tributes while others are dying?  I think Collins is saying that we would, or at least that it's a possibility.  Enough babbling about this fantastic book.  I recommend that anyone and everyone should READ THIS BOOK!  I promise, you will not want to put it down once you pick it up!  It is so wonderfully intense.
I had wanted to read this book for a long time and was not disappointed. I knew this book is considered young adult fiction so I expected that I would be annoyed by under-developed (or completely undeveloped) characters and a cheesy plot line, but that's not how I felt when I read it. Because the main character is a likable and talented teenage girl I can imagine some potential readers saying "Oh no, not again!", but this isn't just another one of "those" books where the pretty teenager gets everything she ever dreamed of and rides off into the sunset etc etc.  This is a post-apocalyptic type book where once a year "the Capital" forces two children/teenagers from each of twelve districts to fight to the death on live (mandatory to watch) television. This is to remind the citizens that the Capital is powerful and that the districts should not revolt against them like they had decades ago.  I got hooked fairly early on and by the time I reached the end of the book (on my Kindle) I had to immediately buy and download the next one so I could keep reading. I would say that partway through the book I might have been able to predict what was going to happen in the end, but then again I could say the same thing about a number of different possible endings Collins could have written. So that leaves me only the ability to say that while the end was not surprising it was still well written and I enjoyed it.  This book will probably be a relatively quick read for most adults but I would definitely recommend it.  After reading the entire series I feel like potential readers should know: This series has relationships in it but it is far from some teen love story where everyone lives happily ever after with their soul mate and the world is a perfectly perfect happy place. People die, often in bloody and terrible ways which not even the children are exempt from. So reader you have been warned - don't read this series if you can't stand violence, murder, blood and general mayhem.  *Review re-posted from goodreads.com
Okay, first off, I didn't hate this series.  Far from it.  It was a page turner for me, except for all the war scenes and planning, and by war scenes I mean in the third book.  I usually stay away from war stories as all that stuff puts me to sleep, but I digress.  The first book was great.  The story moved along really well and it was everything a wonderful story should be.  There were of course questions but you feel confident you'll get answers in successive books, which you do, in the most painstakingly written, overly detailed manner imaginable.  Book 2 was hard to get through, it was actually painful at times.  ----------------------------SPOILERS!!!!----------------------------  Something else that was a little hard to swallow was Kat and Peeta.  All those times when Peeta was in her bed and nothing happened?  Seriously?  How many teenagers do you know, Ms. Collins, or people who live in constant fear and worry for that matter?  I know this is a YA book and the characters were young, too, but given what they've been through, even before the games, and given that they were beyond their years as a result of their lives, I think it would have been okay to allow the characters to move forward in a very real sense rather than circle the drain for the entire book.  And besides, most people would make what little time they have left in this world, count.  They just would.  With all the details she included about everything else, every little thing, sometimes inconsequential things, plus all the mind-numbing inclusions of war and politics and all its variables and monsters and the horrors of war, I really think she needed to include at least one love scene between Kat and Peeta SOMEWHERE in book 2.  That would have been an awesome paycheck for our patience and diligence.  It didn't have to be detailed for goodness sake, but it would have cemented our affection for this pairing.  As it is, she takes us only so far caring about Kat's potential love affairs with one guy or another but all her feelings are never realized or actualized, so in the end all the flirtation, all the near misses and things said and unsaid just comes off as unconvincing, trite and juvenile.  It's fine if Katniss doesn't know who she loves more.  These things SHOULD take time.  You shouldn't jump into a relationship under bad circumstances or "just because" and they're both great guys and she has an amazing connection to both of them and it really doesn't help that Katniss is emotionally retarded, but Collins dropped the ball on the human nature side of things.  As longwinded as the 2nd book is, it really seems like it's an attempt to fill up space to make room for a 3rd book.  After what happens to Peeta in the 3rd book, I no longer care about Katniss or her romances.  And given that this series was centered around those very things from the very start, that's saying something.  The 3rd book -- I just don't know where to start or stop.  Okay, to be fair, Collins really delves into the realism of war and does it really well.  She has a great imagination for all the Capital's crazy weapons and put a lot of work in describing them and what they do in the goriest of details, but after a little while that got tired really fast.  The momentum built up by the previous books is forever lost because so much time is spent on training, healing injuries, and other subplots.  They never get back to building Kat's relationships so she never gets out of the one-dimensional stage.  Nothing about:  The beaus, her mentor, her mother or just figuring out who Katniss herself is.  What does she like to do when she's not hunting, what are her dreams, let's hear some good memories.  She's just always The Girl On Fire and man that old quick, too.  I love girl power and all that and having a healthy image of a girl who's kickass instead of wobbly and silly like Bella Swan who literally falls apart at the slightest of setbacks, but Katniss is the polar opposite and not necessarily in a good way.  People grow, people mature, people make mistakes and hopefully learn from them.  That's what was missing in Twilight and it's missing here, too.  Her life can't always have been bad.  We got one story about how her dad sang, making even the birds stop and that's more or less it.  For a girl who was so upset and devastated over her father's death, we never learn anymore about him.  My dad died when I was 8 and I never quite got over it.  I'm 40 now.  In spite of the fact that I've forgotten so much over the years, there's an awful lot I still remember and cherish...and miss.  I wish I had known him better from a more grown up perspective instead of a little girl one.  I have so many questions only he could answer.  I wish I could tell him so many things and I wish he could have been there for all of my life's ups and downs.  He was my best friend, my Knight, the one person who loved me unconditionally growing up.  Attending my graduations, scaring my beaus, walking me down the aisle, holding my babies - He missed it all.  None of that's ever mentioned in the books.  So when she talks about missing him and how life was hard afterwards, I'm neither convinced nor impressed.  Instead, Katniss just gets homicidal.  She's just single-minded and on a single trajectory and that made her one-dimensional to me.  Because grief takes on many forms.  Collins spends a huge amount of time making Katniss suffer through half the book without Peeta and when she finally gets him back he's been fractured into a million pieces.  I could say that that was incredibly disappointing and horrifying, but the truth is it was brilliant.  That's exactly the way I imagine it would be and exactly what the Capital is capable of doing to him.  It was incredibly heartbreaking that they couldn't have the homecoming they deserved - that we deserved.  And what's even sadder, is that's the last time you feel any hope for these two.  After nearly three books, that's the closest we get?  Unsatisfying doesn't begin to cover it.  The rest of the book is cold and calculating.  From there on, he and Gale are slowly pulled away from her and Kat is turned into another person.  Granted that happens in war and the rest of the book is about the war and its atrocities and that's where it goes to hell for me.  The horrors within were so unappetizing I almost stopped reading it several times.  This is a YA book.  12 and 13 year olds will be reading this and it's all melting people, people being chopped up and descriptions of torture in gory detail.  I just don't know what the hell Collins could have been thinking.  It's written well enough, it describes all the horrors of war really well and all that goes with it in a very realistic sense.  I just didn't want to read that.  I didn't want that to take the place of all the storylines we've invested ourselves in for 2+ books.  If that's where she was always going to go story-wise, I feel like the first two books completely mislead me and that annoys me more than anything.  I expected a war but I didn't need a play-by-play to such a degree.  It literally took half the book.  I expected a resolution in the love triangle but I thought it would have some kind of definitive declaration of Kat's feelings (as in she FINALLY figures out who she wants) but we don't get that, either.  She mentions love once or twice but she never tells it to them.  It's not until the last chapter that she says anything and when she does it's matter-of-fact.  Something to the effect of "we started over again," or something like that.  That's it, that's what we've been waiting all this time for!  That's the whole crescendo, that's what three books and a brutal war with all the losses she's suffered and all that's happened, that's the grand finale.  A half-sentence lukewarm admission of - pshfftsh - who knows.  I don't even know what you'd call it.  No mention of Gale, no mention of her mom, no mention of her mentor.  Just an off-the-cuff mention of being PTSD and getting married and pumping out some kids.  O how romantic.  It's quite literally not anymore touching than what I just wrote.  Katniss speaks so unaffectedly, that I quickly become unaffected, too.  I'm completely at a loss to how to feel about it.  I guess I'm glad for her, I did want her to end up with Peeta, but I wanted to be a witness to it.  Didn't you?  Isn't that why we're here?  Extremely anticlimactic and unsatisfying, that about sums it up.  And just so you know, I didn't expect a happily ever after.  I knew there wouldn't be, how could there be?  I expected her to lose half or more of the people she loved.  That happens in war.  I half-expected the possibility of Katniss dying or at least one of her beaus, maybe both.  Imagine my surprise.  Not everyone that comes home from war is so messed up that they stop living.  I know a lot of soldiers and believe me, if it's one thing soldiers know how to do when they come back from their deployments is LIVE.  And lots of it.  As much as they can do or are allowed to do.  Even the ones who are really traumatized by the war seldom stay that way.  It's true, some are so messed up they never come back.  But for the most part, most of them come back bit by bit.  Katniss it seems never does.  I know she says she does at the end, but I'm not convinced, or moved.  I expected more.  I expected a writer of this caliber and imagination, to come up with an end that involved feeling, growth and real affection and inflection, rather than focusing on weapon specs and military procedure.  Plus, most of all, I thought we were going to watch Katniss grow into a woman, not just a soldier.  For example, when the proposition of another Hunger Games using the Capital's children is discussed - no one could really blame her for feeling this way, so soon after her sister and all, but this would have been an excellent time for Katniss to search within herself and ask herself, `What Would Peeta Do?' because so many times during the series, although she's brave and smart, she only ever thinks about herself.  And she does so again and this was at the end of the series.  For all she's gone through, Katniss hasn't grown an inch.  Maybe Haymitch was right.  She doesn't deserve Peeta.  But I really, really wish Collins had convinced me she does.
While I basically like this book, I found that the "world building" (amount of detail provided) is a bit weak even considering that it's written in first-person voice from the point of view of someone who's largely kept in the dark by a totalitarian government. To me the setting basically seems too surrealistic for the level of believability that the author seems to be aiming for simply due to the lack of detail about the world itself. Obviously the whole premise of the book is far-fetched but in order to have characters who behave according to believable realistic human psychology you need enough detail about the environment to get the feeling that their behavior makes sense. I feel like there are too many unanswered questions and unspecified details to give me confidence that the author is making realistic statements about human behavior and society.  For example, I'm constantly thinking to myself: "There's absolutely no way they'd need to have a lottery to force someone to participate. They would always have volunteers, and if there was a lottery it would be to decide which volunteer actually got the option to become the 'tribute'. There are simply too many adolescents who are suicidal, or want some sort of fame and don't really grasp that they're over 95% likely to die, or maybe just want to die or would be willing to just to be famous for a while."  Maybe I'm just hyperanalytical, or I just spend a lot more time than most people do studying how people behave in real world extreme situations, but while I think the author does understand certain aspects of human psychology very well as it applies to warfare, I still can't help but be bothered by too many behavioral assumptions that just don't seem to match up with real-world study and experiences.
The Hunger Games  by  Suzanne Collins  Made into a movie starring Liam Hemsworth better known for his sometime association with Miley Cyrus. The other `man' is Josh Hutcherson who has a much larger acting experience and the girl at the centre of it all is played by Jennifer Lawrence. Picked up a copy of the DVD but decided to read the book first so back to it. By the way the individual books are a better buy in E-Book Format than the trilogy as a whole.  To stick with movie terminology for a moment this is  a high-concept novel written for young adults. Bucking the trend toward paranormal romance involving werewolves, vampires, and other magical creatures the people here are real but the reality they inhabit is a distopian society of an imaginary future. Genre bending it plays like a Reality TV Show the action playing out in the present with constant flashbacks to the past. Whether this be intended as a parody in the manner of Orwell's 1984 is unclear.  The gender neutral names given the teens leaves their sex in doubt for several chapters however it soon becomes apparent that basic survival is nore important than romance here. Despite the hype surrounding Liam Hemsworth his part in the movie is played down even more than the character Gale in the book. As Jennifer Lawrence says in an interview in the supplements disk movie scripts tend to ruin the book. The reality TV Show analogy is apt, the action being to a large degree scripted, in this case totally so.  The book and the movie are so intertwined I'll do a single blog entry regarding both. Whereas a book tells  you how it happened, a movie shows you; therefore a scene that may take several pages to set up in text passes in seconds on screen. On the other hand before CGI things the imagination can do are damn near impossible sometimes on screen. Holllywood loves young romance so it could not resist playing up the relationship between Peeta and Katniss.  Whether or not Suzanne Collins is aware of it the short story The Lottery by Shirley Jackson published in the June 26, 1948 edition of The New Yorker bears a striking resemblence to this plot line, or should I put it the other way round. The other parallel is The Most Dangerous Game based on a short story by Richard Connell that dates back to 1924 proving that there isn't very much new under the sun.
I was incredibly hesitant to read this book after hearing it was about children killing each other.  However, EVERYONE who told me they read it said I would love it, so I eventually gave in.  The story is so engaging and the picture painted so detailed, that you almost forget children have to kill each other.  The society described is basically nothing anyone would want to live in (oppressed poverty) and is ruled by a caricature of a corrupt government and indulged existence.  The citizens of every district but the ruling one have to choose one child to send to this survival event, held every year to remind them of "the dark days" when humans almost destroyed themselves. It is a fight to the death, leaving only one survivor.  Still, I see why the book is so popular.  I was hooked so hard and fast that I read the entire series in a week.  It's very well written.  The scenery was so detailed (without being boring) that I felt like I could be dropped in the middle of District 12 and find my way straight to every location mentioned. The characters are detailed and likeable, or dis-likeable if that's their  purpose.  The author also manages to keep up so much mystery in their personalities so there are twists and turns in their fight for survival. Thankfully, the actual killing scenes are brief.  So brief in fact, that you almost gloss over them.  I couldn't wait to get to what happened next so I am ashamed to say I barely acknowledged them unless they made me cry.  Parents in doubt, I'm telling you it's a brutal, disgusting story.  I have no idea how this became a children's book!  I certainly wouldn't want any child of mine reading it before they were... 14?  At least old enough to discuss the issues presented in the story. Trust me, there are plenty. I wish I could better explain the positives, which are mainly in the overall writing and description of the character's journey. It's a story focused on survival, not death. The reassurances I received from my friends were all spot on, and I certainly do not regret reading the book.  However, I encourage you read it before you let your child read it.  Borrow it from the Kindle library if you can!
"The Hunger Games" is a book written by the author Suzanne Collins. In my opinion, this book  has a number of genres, such as: actions, adventure, maybe even some romance, sci-fi, and a little bit of drama. I especially like the action parts of this book, when the main character, Katniss, is hunting for food, or when she is training to enter the Hunger games. The main theme of this book, I would say is the inequality of the rich and wealthy people, and the poor people of the lower districts. The rich people have to barely work at all to gain their money or are just born into it. The poor people have to slave around all day in mines and other places, and they barely make pennies a day. I also like how Suzanne Collins writes this book, because when this book starts to get really suspenseful a little bit after the beginning, that suspense stays inside of your mind until the Hunger Games are over. I also thought that a lot of the characters were very extraordinary, especially the ones in District One.  I enjoyed the setting and the plot of this story very much. It was unlike any book that I had read before. It was almost like a post apocalyptic feeling even though it only took place in the non distant future.  It felt post apocalyptic because there was a massive civil war that took place, and an entire District in Panem. I also enjoyed the characters very much because I can relate to them very much. They all have to work hard for what they can get, and once they have it, they have to keep working harder to keep it.   Panem is basically America in the future, but it has been separated into thirteen districts. Then the districts became enraged at the capitol and revolted, a war broke out and ended with huge bombs dropping on District thirteen, completely obliterating it and ending the war. That got me wondering if the people fear the capitol and its people, or just the power that those people posses. Then I figured it all out, they do not fear the people there, they just hate them so much because the capitol people have everything and the other regular people have nothing except for the top three districts. They also fear that the capitol posses because the President could decide to drop bombs on them at any given time, and to the capitol people, killing is merely a game, and they kill mercilessly.  I enjoyed reading this book very much and I hope that you enjoy reading it as much as I do.
The book Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a thrilling and adventurous book. This first person narrative was very interesting and I enjoyed the detailed observances of Katniss Everdeen and the suspenseful situations throughout the storyline. The setting is in a nation called Panem that has been through a huge civil war with rebel forces and the powerful government known as the Capitol. The main theme of the story is power and control. The Capitol is in charge of all of the 13 districts and is very strict, and in some cases extreme in its laws and punishments. When the Capitol was at war with the districts they ended up annihilating district 13 to set an example to the rest of the districts.   The story begins with 16- year old Katniss Everdeen, the main character who lives in district 12. Her family, Primrose and her mom are poor and without a father, who died in a coal mine accident. Katniss was very close to her father, he taught her to hunt and gather roots outside the district fence. Although she continues to hunt in order to support her family and trade at the hob, the black market of district 12. Katniss's hunting buddy Gale accompanies her on her hunts for game to feed both their families. They often talk and express strong feelings about the corruptness of the Capitol and its annual hunger games when alone in the woods.   The hunger games, where there is a drawing to select 2 tributes a boy and a girl from each district ages 12-18 the Capitol enforces it to represent its victory against the rebel forces and their power over the districts. President Snow is the president of Panem and is in charge of everything, including choosing game makers to help decide the outcome of the games. In district 12 Effie Trinket announces the tributes and accompanies them throughout hunger game preparations. Katniss's sister Primrose is called and so Katniss steps forward and Peeta is called to attend the 74th annual hunger games. They now have to compete in the hunger games against 22 other tributes. They prepare for the hunger games by getting advice from their advisor Haymitch, the town drunk. I believe each main character plays a strong role in the novel, and that helps create a good plot. I like the selection and how the author builds onto the main characters. Also the author hints here and there how much the citizens of Panem disagree with the strict rule of the Capitol.   The setting of the book, like I said earlier, Panem is centered with the capital and all the remaining 12 districts are located around the capital. Panem, that has been free of war for 74 years, has a strict government and reminds me of modern countries that are ruled by dictatorship. Suzanne's choice of writing in the first person point of view of Katniss makes the story a whole lot more intense and creates more imagery. There are so many mixed emotions and right away you lean to hate the Capitol. You realize the environment Katniss and the citizens of Panem live in is hostile and unmerciful.  Personally I loved the book and everything about it. Some of my favorite aspects of the book are the suspense, the details, the unpredictable plot, main characters, and the setting. This book was a great start to the trilogy that includes Catching Fire and Mocking Jay. I would highly suggest reading this book especially if you like adventure books, suspense, and a fantastic plot.
The Hunger Games   The book Hunger Games written by Suzanne Collins is a fictional novel that is very interesting to many people. There is a movie about this book because it was so popular. But the movie is very hard to understand if you don't read the book first, so this is my purpose of writing this review to get you to read this book. This book among many other books she has written is and great and a fast read even for slow readers.   One of the reasons her, the author, books are easy to read are because her style of writing. She has a very informal way of writing, like she writes it how you would say it. So as to help draw in her intended audience, which in fact people in early to late teens. Why I say that is because the main character is a 16 years old girl. She is very good at make sure that the intended audience knows who there are by the way she words her books. She makes you feel as if you are part of the story; the detail in the book is amazing. If the was a different shape of brown in a tree she told you about it, the detail is what I thinks brings her stories to life unlike some other authors. But the cliff-hanger at the end is epic and how it makes you go and get the next book, it will make do this I promise you that much.   Now let me tell you more about the story... This all take place in future America and the country has been ravaged by warfare. What is left has been divided into 12 districts and a central capital district like modern day DC. The main character, Katniss Everdeen , is as stated early a 16 year old girl trying to take care of her mom and little sister Primrose after her dad died. But she doesn't do the really safe way as you will read. Now I said that so as not to give away the book as other reviews do.  I find it really annoying to be honest with you. But she does what she needs to to keep her family alive and she is doing well until the yearly election you could call it to see who goes to the hunger games. But I won't go into detail because then the beginning in ruined. The main theme behind this book is very important and Katniss's struggles to keep her family alive is very harrowing and is how we should strive to be. I think the theme is to always keeping going no matter what is in your way. That is really why I recommend this book to everyone.
Hunger Games is a great science fiction young adult novel written by Suzanne Collins. Split into 12 districts, North America (know as Panem) is now controlled by the strict capitol. Every year one boy and girl tribute is selected to represent their district for a fight to the death, this is known as the Hunger Games. The first person structure in this novel makes it very easy for me to follow the writing style. The book has such a creative plot line, and in my eyes has a marvelous futuristic feel to the story.  Given the fact that this book is based in North America it makes me compare and contrast many things in North America today and in the Panem future. In the setting of the book it is mostly fabricated in the Capitol and the Hunger Games arena. If Panem did exist it would be Salt Lake City, Utah and living in SLC Utah makes me vision everything ultimately the same of what I see everyday. The arena where the games take place I envisioned a great forest with countless tall pine trees and prominent mountains surrounding the tributes. How Suzanne Collins wrote the book really helped me imagine the great country of Panem and the arena in which the Hunger Games take place.  The characters in the book are so alive with the intense details that describe each person. The main characters Katniss and Peeta make the book more likeable with their strong attributes. Katniss is a great hunter and good with a bow, in the book it tells how she would learn the great skill of using a bow from her father. Peeta on the other hand is in a family that owns a bakery, so he is strong from lifting flour bags and he is on the more wealthy side of the people in district 12. When given two tributes that are dissimilar in many ways it is simpler to compare them and get a better understanding on the lifestyle in Panem.  Suzanne Collins is a great author and she explains the plot and setting through fascinating characters in a very laid-back manner. I personally enjoyed this book very much with an easy to follow story line with remarkable characters to take you along the action packed book. Hunger Games is a great read and once you read the first book you have to read the next two in the series.
It took me a couple of tries to get into this book at first. The overall story is solid but I found it difficult to really get attached to characters as it lacked interesting dialogue. In my opinion we should have seen more of Gale in the opening chapters so that we get a real sense of the love triangle that's to come and i really wanted to see more of Hamish as well.I was totally hooked when I reached the Hunger Games event, it was exciting, tense and gripping throughout, I couldn't read that part fast enough. The character building or lack thereof just left me wanting a bit more, perhaps that's been held back so that we can appreciate it in book 2??? I love a good romance element but it fell a bit short of what I've come to expect. To be fair i suppose book 1 is called the hunger games and i felt that part of the story to be completely fulfilling. I'm still interested to find out what happens next, I've held off on watching the movie until after the book so perhaps that will add more emotion to the story.  Updated after movie - if I thought that the book was emotionally cold in places boy was the movie so much worse, poor camera work, poor casting, the games themselves were completely lacking in intensity compared to the book, they were lack lustre and lifeless, many details from the book were omitted. A huge opportunity was missed here to make the movie even better than the book and take it to places emotionally that the book never did. It has left me feeling cold. I know Jennifer Lawrence has unfairly received a hard time because she's deemed overweight, a beautiful girl, but on the casting as a whole you do expect the characters to be svelte, running around, climbing trees with ease etc. but it just looks like they walked into a regular high school class and picked a couple dozen random people to play these characters, which gave no credibility to the story as it contradicts descriptions given in the book. This has nothing to do with the review of the book i know, but I urge people not to bother with the movie, as it has actually put me off reading the next instalment.
Review of The Hunger Games  In Suzanne Collins's fast paced book, The Hunger Games, you will feel as if you are alongside Katniss Everdeen as she struggles through poverty, oppression, and potential death. The Hunger Games take place in the country of Panem, a place recently known as North America. Panem is made up of a wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding poor districts. The games serve as a punishment to the districts for their attempt to overthrow the wealthy capitol. Through the violence and brutality in the games, the districts are reminded that the Capitol has ultimate control over them.  "Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor."  As Katniss hears the announcer's sarcastic welcome at the reaping, an event held to house the annual lottery, she thinks about the possibility of being chosen as a tribute in the Hunger Games. Both Katniss and her younger sister Primrose meet the requirements to have their names entered into the lottery. Her biggest fear becomes reality when Prim's name is called to be in the games. Without hesitation, Katniss runs to the front of the crowd and volunteers to compete in Prim's place. Katniss will be forced to compete against a boy and girl from each district, ages twelve to eighteen, in an arena where they will fight to the death.  The Hunger Games is televised and required for all of the members of Panem to watch to serve as a constant reminder of the Capitol's power. Many families are forced to watch as their loved ones are brutally murdered. Gamemakers virtually design every detail of the games, from the number of weapons in the arena to the weather conditions, is under their control. The Gamemakers decide on new rules for the tributes to follow unexpectedly, one of which has a large impact on Katniss and the male tribute from her district, Peeta Mellark.  Throughout the Hunger Games, the role of both rich and poor people and their influences on society as a whole are illustrated, especially the economic influences on the society of Panem. Each district specializes in one industry that contributes to the Capitol. Throughout the story, the power of the Capitol is challenged by the tributes, sometimes unintentionally. The people of the districts take note of their rebellious acts and also begin to question the Capitol's authority.  The role of the poor district people on the country of Panem becomes more significant as the story progresses, leaving readers intrigued by the acts of courage demonstrated.  Rue, a twelve year old contestant that reminds Katniss of her younger sister, Prim, is shot in the chest with an arrow during the games. Although Katniss is expected to fight the young girl, she does the unexpected. Katniss sits by her and sings as Rue takes her final breaths. Katniss shows compassion by burying her in a bed of flowers, an act that the capitol views as rebellious. Through Katniss' brave actions, the people of Panem begin to idolize her. As the Capitol recognizes Katniss' popularity, they attempt to kill her by worsening her conditions in the games.   "As I refill my pack I have an awful thought. The lake. The one I saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound. What if that's the only source in the arena? That way they'll guarantee drawing us in to fight."  Katniss faces many obstacles during the games. She suffers through sleep deprivation, severe burns, stings, cuts, dehydration and deafness. Katniss is forced to form alliances with other tributes when the conditions become too bad to continue alone. Throughout the games, Katniss and Peeta begin to develop feelings for each other. Katniss struggles with her feelings towards Peeta as she questions whether or not the love she feels towards him is only an allusion. The tributes begin to make choices that will reflect their personality to the district people in order to gain popularity. Katniss is confronted with a difficult decision when Peeta is unable to keep up with her. Is it better to save herself or help Peeta?  There is never a dull moment in this story of survival and perseverance. Katniss is faced with many decisions involving the ones she cares for the most and when to stand up for what she believes. Who will come out of the Hunger Games alive? Will the people of Panem follow in the footsteps of Katniss and go against the capitol? You will not be able to put this book down as you go on the journey through the Hunger Games with Katniss.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This is a tale narrated by Katmiss Everdeen.  It is sometime in the future in the country of Panen and there has been a rebellion.  The Capitol has conquered the 13 Districts--note the 13 original colonies--of what was once the USA, and had a nuclear holocaust of District 13. The other 12 Districts are submitted to the Capitol's rule by forcing them to have The Hunger Games--where two children--a boy and a girl--are selected each year to compete in a contest to the death.  Katniss sister, Prim, is selected to compete, and Katniss volunteers to take her place for District 12--the Appalachians and the coal country of today.  The boy selected is Peeta Mellark, the baker's son who had been kind to Katniss when she was hungry.  There is a gruesome description of Katniss' hardships and how she had survived by hunting in the woods with her friend, Gale--to put food in their family's table after her father had died in a coal mine explosion.  Then there are The Games themselves.  The Capitol manipulates them and they are a mandatory spectacle.  Since I don't want to spoil the ending I'll just say that I was disappointed with the fact that instead on concentrating on the carnage itself, the books switches at the end into a love triangle between Gale, Katniss, and Peeta.  The book needs improvement.  Instead of a first person narrative, it could have benefited from the technique of writing from a "point of view perspective."  Instead of having Katniss tell us what she thinks is going on on her coach's mind--Haymitch Abernathy--a prior winner of the games, we could have been shown what was on his mind, if the author told the tale from his perspective. Instead of telling us what Peeta's mind is thinking, Ms. Collins could have showed us if she had told the story from his perspective.  And so on; what the people at District 12 are thinking is told to us by Katniss, instead of using her sister's--Prim--as the perspective.  I know this is supposed to be a young adult's book, but the writing is soapy and childish.  The book reads easily in a day or two, and is quite entertaining.  It just doesn't have much as far as literary value is concerned.
I confess I went in with low expectations. I'd seen lots of people raving about it but with very little detail. About all I knew was "teenage gladiatorial combat", and that didn't really thrill me. I thought perhaps this was some odd dystopian tale of the perfect society that every now and then tossed some of its children into the meat grinder for fun, perhaps a bit like The Lottery but more cruel.  Well, yes and no. I'll put in a mini-spoiler here that is revealed quite early in the book, and that's the fact that this is far from a perfect society, and the tossing of kids into the ring is an intentional act of cruelty by an oppressing victor over its vanquished foes. Once that became clear, these games took on an entirely different feel to me.  And then... Wow!  The protagonist is imperfect but very likeable, responsible but frail, and angry while still compassionate. Yeah, lots of contradictions wrapped up in one amazing character. I found her very compelling.  And the story kept me guessing. One of the drawbacks to writing stories is that you get a good understanding of how stories work, how they flow, the build and release of tension and all that literary crap. It also means that I don't get surprised all that often anymore. And while our protagonist's dilemma is presented fairly early, my guess of the resolution kept changing the further I got in. Oh, betrayal! No, it's going to be sacrificial! No, wait, it's something else! Where is Spartacus??  So, I say definitely check it out. It's got action, tragedy, ingenuity, more tragedy, and some bittersweet victory. The real villains, of course, are those who run the games, and with two books to go in the Hunger Games trilogy, I have some hope that those villains will get fitted for a nice spit.
The Hunger Games starts with an engaging protagonist, Katniss, and continues with an explosive premise: an annual death match between two dozen tributes.  The games push Katniss and the other tributes to their physical, mental, emotional, and moral limits.  However, one part of the game dynamics bothers me.  I'll have to warn you: spoilers ahead.  There are two kinds of tributes.  Most districts choose their tribute by lottery (shades of Shirley Jackson), but three of the districts train some of their children for the games and volunteer them -- the "career" tributes.  In the arena, the career tributes kill most of the lottery-chosen tributes (the innocent ones), and then Katniss kills most of the careers.  The innocent lottery-chosen tributes rarely kill each other (although Peeta kills at least one); the careers don't kill each other, except perhaps in the case of the first career who died on the first day.  The heroine kills 4 out of the 6 careers and none of the non-careers.  This is an old formula: bad guys kill innocents; then the heroes kill bad guys -- that way the heroes get to engage in violence and still be good guys.  Suppose those tracker jackers had been more effective and the last five tributes were Katniss, Peeta, Foxface, Thresh, and Rue?  Aside from that, though, the book is strong in many ways.  Collins shows a lot of violence without making it look sexy.  Getting into a fight is often bad for both parties and the consequences of a wound are severe.  The people who run the game manipulate and pressure the tributes in a lot more ways than just putting them in an arena together.  The interplay between tributes, mentors, and sponsors is subtle and dangerous.  Several of the tributes besides Katniss try different approaches to the game.  Foxface never speaks and appears in only a few scenes, but her unique strategy provoked me to a lot of thought.  Similarly, I don't see Thresh much, but there are tantalizing bits of clues.  I still haven't figured out Peeta's plan -- and maybe that's intentional; maybe he was too overwhelmed to have a good plan.  Haymitch fascinates and horrifies by turns.  Collins does not make him give a speech saying why; she just shows Haymitch and the reader figures him out along with Katniss.  And in a horrifying moment, Katniss realizes that if she lives, she will have to do Haymitch's job.  Caesar has an unexpected streak of goodness.  Is he just good at his job, or does he really give a damn?  I'm interested in reading more about him in the sequel.
Katniss Everdeen has lived in District 12 all of her life. She's sixteen years old and has entered the reaping since she was 12 years old for the Hunger Games held in the Capital. For every year you enter in the reaping one entry is added to the previous year all entries are cummulative. By adding tesserae gives two more entries in the reaping for Katniss. Katniss has been taking care of her family for the last six years since her father was killed in a coal mining explosion. Katniss's mother was no help to the family following her husband's death. So it was up to Katniss to make sure the family had plenty of food. Katniss goes hunting and gathering in the forest beyond the electric fence which could earn her the penalty of death for stealing food. Gale is Katniss best friend and partner together in hunting and gathering in the forest. No words are needed between Gale and Katniss or Catnip as he calls her. Katniss goes home to get ready for the reaping her sister Prim is wearing special outfit today. The Hunger Games is the Capital's way of reminding the other eleven districts about what happened 70 years old when there had been 13 districts. The reaping calls for two tributes one boy and one girl from each district. Haymitch, a previous winner of the Hunger Games, will be the mentor of the two new tributes from District 12. When Prim's named is called Katniss deseperately says she'll be the volunteer in her place. Katniss's world narrows drastically and is stunned when Peeta Mellark's name called instead of Gale's. Katniss and Peeta enter the world surrounding the Capital yet nothing prepares for the gauntlet that is the Hunger Games. How will Katniss and Peeta survive? What will the Hunger Games do to them? Will Katniss and Peeta help each other? Who will win the Hunger Games? Your answers await you in The Hunger Games.
"And may the odds be ever in your favor."  Whether you are interested in finding out what this book means or you are just interested in finding a good new book to read, you're in the right place.  The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, hyped up beyond belief was, to my great surprise, one of the best books I have ever read.  Finishing it in two days, I could not put it down.   There are 723 people on the holding list at the library, just for three weeks of "the book of the decade!"  Within a month of coming out The Hunger Games made millions of dollars.  It surpassed both classics, Harry Potter and Twilight.  When the movie came out a year later, fans screamed for it, newspapers wanted a glimpse at it, and before the midnight premiere, it was almost as loud and crowded as a sold out One Direction concert.  EVERYONE had watched it within two weeks of the premiere.  It was about the only topic of everyone's conversations at school for weeks.   In this popular favorite, you'll find action with a bit of romance.  The United States, now called Panem with twelve districts and a Capitol, hold an annual televised event called the Hunger Games.  Two tributes from each district (one boy and one girl from the ages of 12-18) are chosen to compete in a fight to the death.  Katniss, a sixteen year old girl, gets into the Hunger Games along with another boy from her district.  Who will survive?  What will happen?  Will there be a love story involved?  Find out the answers to all these questions by reading this wonderfully written novel.   Looking for great characters? What about creativity or drama and suspense?  All of these are shown in Collins' book, The Hunger Games. The characters are remarkable.  Protecting her family from harm, Katniss Everdeen hunts for her family with her best friend, Gale, in the Seam (the forbidden part of District 12).  The soft, loving girl helping her mother is Prim, whom Katniss loves dearly.  Also living in District 12, there's Peeta, the baker's son, also known as "lover boy."  And lastly, there are the people living in the Capitol.  They, to Katniss, look very much fake and plastic.   Collins has a great mind especially when it comes to her imagination and creativity.  How many of you could have thought up the plot and setting that she did.  I mean really! North America in the future - Panem with 13 districts (one getting destroyed by the Capitol) and holding the Hunger Games to keep the other districts from trying to over throw the government ever again.  It's genius.   Going along with her creativity comes all the drama and suspense in this book.  Katniss, one minute strategizing her next move, could be scrambling rapidly trying to escape the fiercest wild fire ever, the next!  Or, concentrating immensely Katniss could be figuring out how in the world she is going to get down from the tree and then the next second worrying about how to survive the tracker jacker attack.  Oh, I almost forgot about the romantics of the novel.  Will Katniss fall for best friend or "lover boy?"  Will this lead them to their ultimate fate or help them survive this crazy journey of the Hunger Games and be the first survivors of the Hunger Games for District 12 in 20 years?   Excited to find out more about everyone's fate?  Well you should be. This awe-inspiring contraption is one of the only hyped up books I actually liked.  Have you finished the first book and thirsty for more?  No problem!  The other books in the series are Catching Fire and Mocking Jay.
Do you like romance? Violence? Drama? If so, the Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins is the book for you. Between the love triangles, the food shortages, and the games itself, this book will leave you hanging on the edge of your seat.  The setting and background of this book catches your attention and really contributes to the plot. As you read the book you will see something, very different then anything you have ever seen or heard of. The capital and the districts are located in North America, demolished during a war. Its split up in 13 parts; District 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13, an abolished district, and lastly the capital. The abolishing of district 13, caused the Reaping and led up to the Hunger Games. The reaping sends two people from each district to the games. The Hunger Games are a one to four week process where everyone fights to the death. The reaping is held to remind the districts to never rebel against the Capital again. Each district specializes in something. All these districts give their specialized item to the capital. The Capital, brimming with money and supplied with everything they need from every districts, doesn't participate in the Hunger Games. As you read this series you will see what is to come of the Capital and how the games affect the whole nation and all the characters as a whole.  The Hunger Games has quite a list of characters. The Hunger Games characters, spanning from small parts to larger parts, greatly influences the story. The primary character in this book is Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old living in District 12 of Panem. Katniss, brown haired, brown-eyed girl, seems very general. But she's not. She can hunt better than anyone in district 12, along with her fellow hunter, Gale. Gale Hawthorn is one of the strong male parts in the Hunger Games. Along with being the person who hunts with Katniss, he is her best friend, her supporter, like a cousin to her. They both hunt for one reason. To support their family. Katniss father was killed in a mine explosion along with Gale's father. That leaves their family with very little. Gale's family is made up of his mother, Hazelle, and his three younger siblings, Posy, Rory, and Vick. Katniss's family is much smaller, made up of Prim and her Mother. Prim is her 11-year-old sister. It is her first year in the reaping. She only has one slip in the glass bowl, but consequently got picked. Katniss, terrified for her sister, offers to be a tribute. We are introduced to Peeta Mellark, the male tribute. Peeta, the youngest of the four bakers sons and a strong and kind-hearted boy, confesses his love to Katniss during the games. Throughout the book you see Peeta and Katniss's character developing and creating entertainment that will make you love this book.  Overall I think was a very good book. She used vocab that was fairly simple that could get boring at points, but still kept you on the edge of your chair. The setting was very creative, and the plot of the story though very disturbing, was highly entertaining. The end of the book was a real cliffhanger, which will almost force you to have to read the second. As a whole I would give this book a 4.5 out of 5 only because the vocab was not very educational, but the book itself is highly enjoyable.
I am a little bit conflicted with this book. I enjoyed the plot and the character of Katniss. In fact there are a lot of things to like about the novel. But I really had a problem with the world building. The story takes place in a post apocalyptic North America. There is very little back story provided. A long time ago there was a calamity, out of which came the country called Panem. It is ruled from a Capitol city surrounded by 13 districts. 75 years ago or so the districts rebelled against the Capitol and were defeated. One district was obliterated and the remaining 12 are forced every year to supply two teens, one male and one female to compete in the Hunger Games, a televised contest where the teens will fight to the death until only one remains. The purpose is stated to be partly revenge for the rebellion and an attempt to intimidate the districts, because of a fear that another rebellion could take place.  The teens from the Districts are chosen by lottery. For the purposes of the novel it is obviously more dramatic if the odds of getting picked are higher- so we are told the total population of District 12, the home district of our protagonist, is 8,000 people. If we assume that the other district's populations are of the same magnitude, then the total population of all the districts is about 100k to 150k. That's not a lot of people, especially since it is implied that the districts cover the former area of the US, the Capitol being specifically placed in the novel in the Rocky Mountains and District 12 in Appalachia. Furthermore the Capitol is implied to be a large city, and has a very high technology. A technology that has cloaked hovercraft and the ability to genetically modify animals. In contrast the Districts technology is that of horse drawn carts and bow and arrows (although they have TV).  It makes no sense that the Districts would be militarily any challenge to the Capitol- they are too few people at too great a distance away, with too primitive technology. And it makes no sense for a Capitol so technologically advanced to rely on (very few) half starved laborers to provide them raw materials and food. The whole premise behind the idea of the Hunger Games just didn't ring true to me.  Having said all that I did like the book, and after the first few chapters I got engrossed in the drama of the games themselves, forgetting about the world outside the arena.
As a writer, I am sometimes brutally critical of others work. Not a keen reader of others works. However the Hunger Games both as a book and now on DVD, is one of the most thought provoking and HONEST works I have had the pleasure to read and WATCH as a movie.  I was impressed by the directors' work. The characters, the production and the book in itself are as close to how future wise WE WILL BE as a HUMAN race.  I've read some critics reviews re the book. We are by our nature a cruel and sometimes brutally savage race of beings. Suzanne captures the essence of that brutality and if Katniss appears a little cold and indifferent then lets not be critical of her attitude in that sense. Why should she NOT feel, be aware of the savage cruelty of those who purport to be kind? To be caring ? When she knows and no doubt fears, the terrible realization that what she dreaded has come to fruition.  If she has to kill to survive? To win at all costs ? Who we ask put her there in the first place, WHO decided her course of action, her chosen path ? The reality show? Lets face it, reviewers should stop bleating about the scenario being anything but plausible. We only have to take a look at the current reality situation to understand the truth on that !  The Arena has long featured in human activities from the Romans to the Greeks and across the centuries in one form or another. For true honest SPORT or for savage games, brutal consequences in the hunt to the death.  Love the book, loved the movie and due credit to Suzanne for her brilliant work, read the book as it is not how YOU want to perceive it as anything but HONEST. Savage, cruel and indifferent, just like us as so called HUMAN beings, sometimes sad to see that that is so close to the word HUMANITY. We are often anything BUT !
Let me just state that I'm not saying that the book or the writing style was bad but... Battle Royale came out before and it was much better, more tightly plotted and it left me feeling what this book was unable to make me feel which was sad and angry.  In this case I completely blame Katniss for this little hicup.  Katniss as a the main character was dull, cold, prickly, not engaging... I kept scratching my head going 'why does Peeta or even Gale like her?'. I kept wondering why her? Why this girl who by her own admition was only made to stand out by Peeta and the help of her stylist the one that ignited rebelion? As a main character Katniss just lacked that something that made you want to root for her or even become attached to her. I mean in the beginning you never find out why people from district 12 were attached to her... she hunted? Definately not because of her warm and inviting personality because she didn't have one.  Then there was Katniss' undue angst over her non-existant love life. I mean she's killing people or running for her life and she's wondering 'Peeta or Gale?' or feeling guilty because of her developing feelings for Peeta because of her friendship with Gale because Gale has feelings for her that she doesn't share... Right, because when I'm killing people or watching other people be butcher I'm going to have moments where I feel all conflicted about who in my so cliche love triangle I should choose. It made me want to hurl. Why does every book that comes out now have to have a love triangle in the first place? Come on the concept that a person could be so very indecisive as to not 'know' which person they have feelings for is just annoying. Then add to the fact that the two mem (why is it always men by the way? I find the concept sexist that pretty much all the love triangles out there consist of the male characters waiting with baited breath going 'pick me!'.)are just hoping against hope that the women will turn their fickle affection toward them... again barf.  I have to say that there was also the characters self absorption, everything from the first book to the last was about oh you guessed it Katniss. She never looks beyond herself and what she's lost and her own pain.  It's been a while since I've disliked a main character this much.  On the whole the plot wasn't bad just something I've read before, the world the writer created was interesting but nothing out of the ordinary.  On the whole this book was just that so ordinary it was unremarkable.
I lucked out.  I worked at a bookstore that had galleys (Advanced Reader Copies) of this book and I grabbed one because a co-worker in the Children's Department spoke so highly of it.  Then it sat on my desk for a year and half collecting dust, until one day, needing something to read, I finally picked it up and within 20 pages began mentally kicking myself for going so long with out reading it!  Collin's descriptions of this future dystopian nightmare are so vivid that when the characters actually get to eat, you feel just as gratified as they must be.  Survival takes on a whole new meaning in this series.  I think this is why I loved it so much.  In our age of instant gratification and communication, feeling so removed from my life and being inserted into Katniss' was a treat, despite her dire circumstances.  What would we do if we had to hunt for our food in order to not starve to death?  To live everyday in fear of a fascist government that could obliterate our existence at any moment?  To have to literally fight to the death to save our own life?  The characters are fantastic.  I have heard from others that Katniss came across as un-nuanced and boring.  I completely disagree.  Is she supposed to be giggly and cheerful living in this hell?  Surviving another day and feeding her family is the only thing on this young woman's mind, and I felt that with her every step of the way.  I was on the edge of my proverbial seat every second of this book, and over-joyed when I discovered it was a trilogy.  This is YA fiction, but like Harry Potter, it has mass appeal.  A definite must read.  Just be sure to give yourself a little time because you won't be able to put it down or rest until you find out how it all ends . . .
The Hunger Games is, technically, well-written, but its style is not very engaging. Katniss, as the narrative voice, is too apathetic. She doesn't show compassion towards others, except maybe her sister, and even that is evident only in her decision to take her place in the games. Her sole focus is in hunting and surviving. She's very narrow-minded. She never seems to consider the broader scope of the society she lives in. Human history provides many examples of people in harsh conditions who consider how to make life better not only for themselves but for others. Consider slavery. Frederick Douglass learned to read and write while enslaved, and escaping wasn't enough for him. He fought to free all of the slaves. Katniss instead chooses to tolerate her life and hope that neither she nor her sister get selected to participate in the games. It never once crosses her mind to try and do something proactive.  Of course, readers of the novel understand that Collins is not endorsing a society that makes use of child violence for entertainment. I've heard and read many discussions of people saying how horrible the slaughter is, but this discussion does not happen within the novel. The viewpoints of the characters are not discussed, not even in the sense that many of us talk about the violence in our large cities. The problem with the violence is that it plays out more like a Hollywood action movie, which serves the goal of making it exciting rather than a condemnation of violence. These teenagers fight one another more like action heroes/villains and cold-blooded, experienced assassins than frightened, inexperienced teens. The novel's message would have been more effective had Collins instilled the sense of terror of battle, or a sense that these teenagers are being forced to kill when none of them want to. And with an exception of one character, the deaths are not seen as tragic, but as one less obstacle in the way of Katniss winning. In Howard Fast's The Hessian, grown men prepare to ambush a troop of Hessian soldiers. As they wait for the Hessians to arrive, they shiver with fear that they'll die. And when the ambush is an overwhelming success, they grow sick at the sight and smell of death. That level of humanity is missing here.  What also struck me was the lack of emotion during the lottery process. Where are the mothers and fathers crying out in agony, fighting desperately for their children? Why aren't the teens themselves overwhelmed with fear? They all accept their fate like sheep. Nobody fights for their own survival, or the survival of loved ones. They simply accept their fates. This is why I included the Martin Luther King quote at the start of this review. The people of Panem accept a negative peace in order to avoid tension rather than a positive peace. I can't help but think of King's condemnation of those who silently watch and do nothing, believing that justice will prevail eventually but feeling no need to fight for it. The novel views Katniss as a strong female character, but she doesn't fight except when her own survival depends on it. To me that's cowardice. And it's short-sighted. She's no stronger than her mother because she's just as mute when it comes to her society. She would rather tolerate her life than fight to make it better for her and her people. Her only form of rebellion is to say, I refuse to have any children. That's good for her, but what about the generations to come?  At one point in the novel, Gale wonders what would happen if everybody refused to watch the games. This is an interesting question, but it's the wrong one. The right question to ask would be, what if the tributes refused to fight?
In a futuristic setting, the parallels of fiction grasp the reader as they relate to the emotions of physical existence. A tale of wilderness survival compounded by a game of Tributes and Careers. "The Most Dangerous Game" meets "Lord of the Flies" meets "Spartacus"... on P.E.D.s! This pretense for The Hunger Games can only be described, nominally, as "Brilliance Noir". In the imposition of fate by lottery, the raconteur offers a perspective of indistinguishable fortitude and submission dosed with defiance. This is pronounced by the spry maturity of Katniss' voice, as the spirit of an arduous time in her life, as it pertains to the narrative zeitgeist of the history of Panem. In this way, our protagonista has generated an anthropological primary source to a developed "possible world."  The perspective of Katniss offers the reader little resistance to the savagery of Panem and the perils of the arena. This literary tool I found to be both captivating and liberating. As an outsider the very idea is barbarous and inhumane. From within the arena the imperative to participate seems essential; almost germane. The dichotomy of selflessness/sustainability is permeated by the concept of "tessera" as it relates to cooperative economics in a vastly codependent society. The barter system amongst Tributes could not have been more eloquently presented by Collins. The reality of survival deviates from non-fiction at the same time it personifies it.  Irregular syntax in dialogue (and introspection) offers an abrupt euphony in perusing for flow. The acceptance of the sociological status quo by Panemanians is the gap that must be bridged by the reader in the abstraction of psychological themes. The administration of mythical Panem could be thought of as "post-historical/neo-democratic" in the sense that this future-primitive setting is both archaic as well as technologically advanced. This is exemplified in the contrast between the economies of the Hob and the firmamental holographic projections and hovercraft used by the Gamemakers. Although it is unclear as to how the Gamemakers can observe the events of the struggle and the players actions through the tree cover or even broadcast the games to the viewing citizens. I assume that the environmental controls are a similar object of this fiction.  Overall, a well-bound and rounded-off installment as the first book in a series. Suspenseful and Satisfying!  Text Excerpt pp. 310-311:  "No more fear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But then... what? What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food. Take that away and I'm not really sure who I am, what my identity is. The idea scares me some."
The nation of Panem was born out of the ruins of what was once known as North America, and at its center is a powerful, beautiful, and technologically-advanced city known as the Capitol. Twelve Districts surround the Capitol. It was once thirteen. Once, long ago, the Districts tried to overthrow the oppressive Capitol. They were all defeated, District 13 was annihilated, and as a reminder to never rebel again the Hunger Games were born. Every year, each of the twelve Districts must send one boy and one girl, aged 12-18, as tributes to fight in the Hunger Games. It's a brutal fight to the death, and there can only be one survivor. When Katniss Everdeen's twelve-year-old sister is selected as District 12's seventy-fourth female tribute, Katniss volunteers to be tribute in her place. Thus begins an unrelenting story of one girl's desperate quest to survive in a contest she stands little chance to win. Making matters worse is that the boy tribute from District 12 is Peeta Mellark, a boy who once saved her life.  THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins is a non-stop journey into the desperately flawed heart of humanity. Twenty-four teenagers are thrust into an impossible situation that requires them to do things they were never meant to do merely to survive. The result is violent and unsettling, but we grow to love Katniss Everdeen and hope for her survival because she seems meant for so much more than the Hunger Games. She seems meant to cut to the heart of the Capitol, and this story seems to begin that journey.  I'm not sure why, but I really enjoy post-apocalyptic stories, and this is one of the best I've read. The story concept is twisted, and no sane person could hope for another person's death because they ended up in the Hunger Games, but the story creates a world that is obviously corrupt and desperately in need of redemption. I loved that about this story. I haven't read the other two books in the trilogy yet, but I'm hoping for a taste of redemption by the end.  I loved the first-person narrative of the story because it makes the reader feel like they're experiencing the Hunger Games through the eyes of Katniss. I also felt like I really got to know her character because we get to hear her thoughts throughout, and she quickly became a very likable character.  Foundational to the concept of THE HUNGER GAMES is the idea of sacrifice, that for one person to live someone must die, or in this case, twenty-three people must die. Katniss makes what will possibly be the ultimate sacrifice when she volunteers to be a tribute in her sister's place, and we see this concept of self-sacrifice throughout. For the most part, the tributes aren't heartless. They don't want to kill, but they must kill to survive. But alliances are built along the way that makes the idea of killing someone you possibly care about very difficult. Collins amps up the stakes up to the very end of the story with this theme. Will Katniss kill to survive? More importantly, will she kill someone she's grown to care about to survive? Collins pulls you into the story with the emotional cost the Capitol wants the tributes to pay.  The world of THE HUNGER GAMES is incredibly well-built. I could picture the run-down appearance of District 12 and the gleaming technological perfection that is the Capitol. This is another way the first-person narrative really helped to drive the story. Panem is the epitome of human depravity as we learn that those in charge in the Capitol have an insane thirst for power, and this plays out in their enjoyment of watching the teenaged tributes slaughter one another in their yearly games. Their greatest source of entertainment is also their primary method of exacting punishment and ensuring the obedience of the Districts.  The characters were brilliantly developed. Katniss Everdeen, a girl who has survived heartache and subsequent abandonment because of the death of her father, cares deeply for people. Collins shows this through Katniss' actions and inner dialogue over and over again throughout the story. Yet she's also forced to do things that no one would ever hope they had to do. I found myself desperately wishing she didn't have to kill anyone, but understanding that she's been placed in the most impossible of situations. Haymitch, Katniss' mentor, is intriguing because of how winning the Hunger Games has affected him. Peeta Mellark, the boy tribute from District 12, is an interesting character because of the choices he makes throughout the story and the revealed motivations behind those actions. The other tributes range from sweet and innocent to vengeful and bloodthirsty. The collective entity known as the Capitol is the most mysterious character of all. They leave me with the most questions. How did they get so powerful? Why did the Districts feel they needed to rebel, and why was the Hunger Games the response the Capitol came up with to punish the Districts for their betrayal?  The end of THE HUNGER GAMES left me wanting to read the second book immediately. I'm interested to see the aftermath of what happens in this story and Katniss' place in it all.  Given the popularity of THE HUNGER GAMES movie, it's clear that Suzanne Collins has written a story that resonates with people. It explores the messy choices people must make in the midst of a dangerous world and the nature of sacrifice. It's a dark story, but it's a story that confronts us head-on with the value of human life and challenges the terrible ways we're tempted to treat one another. I can't wait to see the movie now that I've read the book, and I can't wait to dive into CATCHING FIRE.  I received this book for free for review from Scholastic, and I was not required to give a positive review
When I fly internationally, I usually watch movies that I wouldn't normally watch at home. Back when my wife and I were together, I thought it was funny. We'd be scrolling through a list of movies to watch and I would say "I saw that" and she would look at me like I was crazy and ask in a very surprised tone "when did you see THAT?" Well, we're not really together any more (but we are getting along better) but I am still travelling internationally. On a recent trip to Mexico, I realized I had caught up on every George Clooney movie, so I decided to give The Hunger Games a chance.  All I knew about The Hunger Games was what a religious leader I respect had said "it's terrible that so many people are excited about a movie that glorifies killing people" (or something close to that).  I guess I also knew that there was a dude in the movie that my daughters thought was hot. So I settled in and watched a movie that I knew nothing about, with little opinion about what to expect (kind of like watching a George Clooney movie  The Descendants,   but with young people in it).  In the end, I was entertained and eager to watch with the girls when I returned home to the states.  While we waited for the movie to become available to the rest of the public, Lorna read the whole series.  I finished reading the first 4 Song of Ice and Fire books and Tom Andry's  Bob Moore  Bob Moore: Desperate Times  series. While I waited for Tom's knew book and the 5th Ice and Fire book to be more reasonably  A Song of Ice and Fire, Books 1-4 (A Game of Thrones / A Feast for Crows / A Storm of Swords / Clash of Kings)  priced, I decided to read the first book of the Hunger Games.  My ex playfully mocked me "that's a book for teenage girls". Yeah, but I saw the movie and it was good and it's sitting around the house for free, so I ignored her jabs.  Since I was a teenager, I have been very interested in apocalyptic scenarios, when my kids were younger, I became less interested, but lately I have been really interested in predictions of what could happen to us. My religious friend was kinda right, killing is glorified in this book, but only as a form of oppression.  The citizens of Panem are lucky enough to not live in a time of bipartisan bickering. They live in a time that probably resulted from it, only in this future scenario, there is absolute power, and they remind their citizens of this power by putting on The Hunger Games.  As a fan of rebellion, intelligence and resourcefulness, I can't help but love the main character "Katniss" and sympathize with her plight as she reluctantly becomes the star of The Hunger Games.  I am left intrigued at the end and wanting more, wandering what happens in the next 2 books, how does she handle her relationships with Gale and Peeta, what happens to her Mom and sister, what would George Clooney do? I check and A Dance with Dragons is still $14.99 to download, while Lorna has the second book of The Hunger Games downloaded on her Kindle, I guess I will find some of the answers to my questions while I wait on more reasonable pricing.
I've heard references to "The Hunger Games" for some time now, and as I pay little to no attention to pop culture phenomenons, I ignored this one till my husband rented the movie on Amazon on Saturday night. The movie intrigued me enough to check out the digital sample, and I followed that up by buying each installment of the trilogy.  The premise is the struggle between a decadent, corrupt city-state ruling over the unwashed masses with an iron fist, and the strongly individualist protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. She's a 16 year old who unwittingly and unwillingly becomes a national symbol of resistance to the tyrannical central authority. She stumbles into this role when she volunteers to take her younger sister's place in a deadly annual ritual forced upon the populace. This is called the "Hunger Games", wherein 24 people, one male and female from each of 12 districts, are pitted against each other in a winner takes all struggle to the death for the entertainment of the effete citizens of the Capitol, and the humiliation of those subjugated to them.  Both sides of the storyline take their roles to extreme levels, the central authority so cold and calculating that it forces adolescents to murder each other, gruesomely, and celebrates the spectacle, and Katniss taking individualism so far as to appear rather repellantly self-centered and unaware of others, or the bigger picture playing out around her.  I'm giving this four stars for several reasons. I liked the premise well enough to pay the $5 it cost on Amazon Kindle, but I'm not a fan of first person narration. While the author pulls the technique itself off, the fact that the person narrating is so frequently confused and/or conflicted about events and her own emotional reactions (or lack thereof) to them detracts from the overall effect.  I found myself liking the people who loved Katniss more than I liked Katniss, herself. She couldn't understand why they loved her, and frankly, neither could I. She's almost wholly a creature of impulse, alternately swayed by the impulse for individual survival, and the impulse to do whatever she needs to do in order to live with herself afterward. Regardless, her motivation is selfish. Her only truly unselfish act of sacrifice is when she volunteers to take her sister's place as a player in the Hunger Games.  Her final act in the Game is another impulse decision, an act which unexpectedly proves to be the catalyst for a long-simmering rebellion against the Capitol. The David vs. Goliath struggle foreshadowed throughout the first book led me to purchase the rest of the books in the trilogy, mostly to see how the rebellion would play out.  On reading back over this, I can see how my overall impression of Katniss, formed after having read all three books in the past day and a half, has colored her more harshly than a reading of the first one alone would have done. I rated it three stars originally, and upon thought increased it to four stars for this installment of the set.
Sometime in the, hopefully, very distant future, the United States is divided into 12 districts, with the capitol located high up in the Rocky Mountains, where it is easily defensible from the hoards of disgruntled citizens.  In the capitol district, everything is fine, but elsewhere, it's a sub-sub-standard of hand-to-mouth living.  Each district is responsible for a specific service to the country: providing coal, manufacturing, agriculture, etc.  To keep the citizens entertained, each year the capitol district hosts the Hunger Games.  Participants are selected at random, with one boy and one girl chosen from each district.  We follow the fate of the twelve, focusing on the pair from District 12.  They are very close friends Katniss, daughter of a miner killed in an explosion, and Peeta, son of a baker.  But, according to the rules of the game, only one may survive.  The dozen are placed in a specially developed arena to battle each other to the death, leaving only one survival.  The weapons include bows and arrows, slingshots, spears, rocks, anything that will make for a gory death. That's the fiction part.  The science part entails the various ways the nation has of watching the participants on TV.  Through technology, each of the 12 is continually monitored.  At the end of the day, the pictures of those who have deceased during the day are projected onto the sky so the combatants know how they stand. Further, the game directors can, at will, change the weather conditions to make life even more difficult.  Also, from time to time, support for an individual participant is parachuted to the one in need. That's just the bare-bones description of what goes on here.  There is so much more to this captivating book.  I couldn't stop reading it and will immediately turn to the next book in the series, "Catching Fire."
It is the future, and the nation of Panem has arisen out of what was once North America. Panem is represented by a glorious Capitol, and the world Panem rules is divided into 12 Districts, each focused on a particular industry, like agriculture or coal mining. Those in power remind the citizens of Panem just how insignificant they are once a year, by forcing each District to choose one boy and one girl to represent it in the Hunger Games, a battle of survival televised to all citizens. The contestant who wins the Hunger Games spends the rest of their life as a celebrity to their District and all of Panem, while the other contestants meet their fate at the hands of one another.  Katniss Everdeen is a 16-year-old resident of District 12. She steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games, and although she expects it to be a quick death sentence, she realizes she actually wants to survive, and win. But what she faces in the Games--both physically and emotionally--is far beyond anything she could imagine, because much like our own reality shows, the Capitol manipulates the circumstances of the Games.  This book hooked me from the very start. While the creation of a new world out of the one we know isn't new, Collins' depiction of Katniss' life and the description of the circumstances around the Hunger Games is tremendously compelling. Having watched more than my share of reality shows and knowing how "real" they are, I still was captivated by the Games themselves. And while I had suspicions of how the story would unfold, I still was excited to finish the book. If I had any criticism of the book, it's that its main character was a 16-year-old girl, so some of the rationale behind Katniss' actions, and her reactions to situations, were a little childish, but this didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.
That I'm an "older reader" who cares very deeply about what's replacing Lord of the Flies in 10th Grade English as "the morally challenging novel"? That I'm not going to compare the two books? That I'm looking for things to read my grandchildren? (No: not this, not yet.) And that I'd give it 3.5 stars if amazon.com would only let me?  All that's accurate, but this will simply be a straight up comment on what I found to be a surprisingly appealing, often gripping, and sometimes moving young adult yarn. For me - given the right reading material, I can be a sentimental, foolish, fond old man - as long as I didn't stop to ponder but just let the story roll over me like a Saturday-matinee movie, The Hunger Games worked fairly well for some three-fourths of the way through. Then, with too many rabbits being pulled too frequently out of too many hats, it became a (bloody, but not obscenely so) Saturday morning cartoon, oozing its way along to a predicable, but nevertheless satisfying, conclusion, and then some.  But as long as the story ripped along, I liked Suzanne Collins' pacing, telling us just what we need to know only when we need to know it, and interspersing introductions to a fairly stock range of sympathetic-to-despicable characters, who give the interesting, attractive (but who knows it? she doesn't think so) resourceful (of course!) young heroine Katniss Everdean something varied to react to, thereby to define her character for us. In fact, I liked Katniss a lot (and Rue, too) - I think Katniss might even grow up to be something very like Lizabeth Salander, a dark avenger - Peeta a little less, and I liked the tension over variously motivated characters that Collins builds into the story. (I haven't seen the film but greatly look forward to seeing whether it succeeds as well as the book in creating nerve-wracking anxiety over fundamental "who can I trust?" issues. I found that cluster of worries handled very, very adroitly by Collins.)  I also enjoyed the moral quandaries Collins thrusts upon her young readers, asking them to confront questions of right and wrong, at the existential level, in the starkest of contexts. If the author is sufficiently skillful in drawing the reader in, playing the "what would YOU do?" game creates a deeper involvement with the story and makes the material grip harder. One is forced to wonder, however - spoiler? nah: just a musing -  one wonders why everyone goes along, like Orwell's Eloi, with the murderous, dehumanizing games, why it never occurs to the majority of "Tributes" - or even a small, rebellious sub-subset - to try and take over the game, gang up on and dispose of the bullies, then go on strike, trying to exert some muscle of their own, despite the stacked odds. In the end, Collins' rationale for the games and the compliance of the Tributes isn't very compelling, and that's part of my problem with the last quarter of the book, which then - finally, when you do stop to ponder - feeds back into, and recolors, the first three-quarters.  Because Collins' silly, post-apocalyptic North America, Panem, is almost wholly unbelievable, a  dystopic cartoon state that might have been dreamed up by Ayn Rand on crack. But of course if we have no silly, murderous, authoritarian, plutocratic, crypto-Roman Panem (with its profusion of ridiculous Roman given names - I know: it's post-apocalyptic, the world has de-evolved, regressed, whatever, we're back in a North American version of Nero's Rome, bloody games and all) - we have no pretext for a "most dangerous game" scenario, and thus no book.  But, perhaps most important of all and trumping those reservations about the story: as Shakespeare (!!!! Here? I sincerely apologize, but I really do have a point) demonstrated in his "romances" or "romantic fantasies" at the end of his career as a playwright, you can put people into absolutely absurd situations ("Pericles, Prince of Tyre," "The Tempest," "The Winter's Tale") and, at the end, if those people are written as compelling human beings - and they were, and Collins more or less does - then the very human emotions that play out against even the loopy backdrops nevertheless move audiences powerfully. Human emotion is human emotion, easily recognizable as genuine or not in any type of writing, and Suzanne Collins, in my reading, succeeds in pulling the right strings.  I'm not sure I'll continue with the series - okay, I probably will: I read all the Harry Potters (they were sooooo Dickensian...) - but I thought spending a few hours with this one at the beach last weekend was most worthwhile. (Hmmmm, I've almost talked myself into adding another star...)
I was given The Hunger Games for my birthday a couple of months ago and made it a priority read, even though I have over a dozen books on my shelf that have been calling out my name to be read for over a year now. Now that the Hunger Game series is complete, a movie has been made, and the store shelves are complete with merchandise, I figured I'd finally get on the bandwagon and check what all the hype is about.  In case you're wondering, I was avoiding The Hunger Games for a couple of different reasons. One being the issue of my reading backlist. The other being that the plot sounded too much like Battle Royale. As clunky as some of the writing was, Battle Royale was a great novel. You can check out my review for it here. But when The Hunger Games came around, I figured it was just a copycat of Battle Royale and decided to avoid it like I do so much other uninspired fiction and entertainment.  When I finally finished The Hunger Games (I'm referring to Book 1 in this review), I realized that there were enough differences in character, plot, and writing style to call The Hunger Games somewhat original when compared to Battle Royale. However, I won't say I was enamored with the book overall.  The Hunger Games opens with a great character voice, that of Katniss Everdeen. One major thing that keeps The Hunger Games apart from Battle Royale is that Battle Royale was written from many different points of view and The Hunger Games focuses on one specific character, her story told in 1st-person. It works well for the book and does a great job getting me to invest in the character.  The plot of The Hunger Games is believable and tragic. You understand from the very beginning what the conflict in the story is and the seemingly impossible odds the characters in the book have to face in order to live day to day. I especially loved the parts about the hunting that goes on past the fence surrounding District 12 and the loyalties that the residents of the district have to each other as opposed to the Capitol. It gave a sense of hope in mankind and shed light on the aspect of community.  The book progresses along pretty smoothly. I enjoy Collins's writing style. Never once did I have to stop and reread a passage to figure out what the author was trying to say. That's important to me as a reader, because I have so many books I want to read, I really don't want to be wasting my time having to reread stuff I've already read just to understand what the characters are doing or where they are in the story. I have trouble with this sometimes in some of Stephen King's work. As much as I love his Dark Tower series, there are many times I have to reread passages to figure out what the heck is going on or what King is trying to say. Most of that is probably due to the fact that he has so much exposition in his novels. Collins does a good job balancing exposition with action to keep the reader moving along.  The world of The Hunger Games didn't feel filled out. In Battle Royale, the characters question the government, their world, others around them. In The Hunger Games, it seems to be well-accepted that children will be thrown into an arena to kill each other at some point in their adolescence. The parents of these children don't seem as broken up over this as I would expect them to be. Maybe if the world was ALWAYS like this from the time of its creation, I could believe it, but the book clearly explains that things were not always like this. I've heard that a rebellion begins in the second book in the series, but it felt strange that it didn't start in this one.  When I read Battle Royale, it took hundreds of pages to get through the 42 contestants. It seems by the time I got about halfway through The Hunger Games, there are only a handful of participants left alive. And herein lies one of my gripes. The killings felt a little evasive - in regards to the author's willingness to tell/show us what happened. I'm not asking for gratuitous violence - especially since this is a `young adult' book - but I yearned for a little more description as to what happened to the other characters. Some seemed to just vanish into thin air, with no real details of how they died.  Battle Royale was also a bit more gruesome than The Hunger Games, as well as more psychologically rife. That's one thing I didn't find realistic about The Hunger Games. It seems some of the characters do in fact question the morals associated with killing one another, but they seem way more concerned with their own well-being than allowing a corrupt government establishment to turn them into murderers. Katniss barely questions killing anyone during her time in the arena. When she does finally make her first kill - intentional or not - she stops for a few seconds to ponder it and then she is off again on her adventure. I completely understand that one doesn't have much time to get philosophical when in a bloodbath arena dueling others who want to kill you, but still. She seems to carry little to no remorse, and I find that to be somewhat disturbing in a novel aimed at such a young audience.  One thing that I did not like about the book was the ending.  *Spoiler Alert*  Throughout the whole book, I was anticipating Katniss to rebel against the Capitol. In fact, I told myself that if it didn't happen, and if she just went along with the rules of the game and came out the winner simply due to the fact that she killed the rest of the participants, that I would hate the book. I mean, what purpose would the book even have if it just stood to chronicle a mass of kids killing each other for the amusement of a sick and twisted government?  First, I felt surprised, shocked, and somewhat confused when the wolves came into the arena. You know, the ones who are actually mutated versions of the other contestants of the Hunger Games. That was weird, felt a little out of place, and was never explained. Granted though, there are more books in the series, so I guess it's kind of okay that this was left somewhat open ended. But it felt random.  Hope was instilled in me when Katniss and Peeta decide to rebel against the rules of the Game stating there could only be one winner after the rule was changed earlier to include two winners. It came as no surprise to me that the Capitol went back on the rules - they want entertainment, and I knew pitting two victors from the same district against each other would satisfy that need for an entertaining fight. When Katniss and Peeta decided to feign taking the poison berries so that the Capitol would have no victors, I was glad for the welcome story twist.  From that point on, it felt as if there was another climax that was building up. There were still a few chapters left in the book, and I had hope that Katniss would rebel against the Games and start a riot or something and that would open up the door for the second book in the series. Maybe the wolf creatures would be explained. At least, that's what I thought might happen. Instead, for a couple of chapters, the author builds up this crazy tension and anticipation. Katniss is filled with paranoia about what the Capitol is going to do to her and Peeta since they rebelled with the berries. So while the Capitol is putting on a show of crowning Katniss and Peeta as victors, you're left waiting with bated breath as to what the Capitol really has up its sleeve. I mean, these two kids just pulled the government's punk card. Surely there will be retribution.  I literally find myself on the edge of my seat as I rip through these last chapters, waiting for something great to happen, something to fulfill my desire for an uprising against this travesty of a government. I mean, we're talking about twelve districts against a corrupt government. And yet, there isn't much mention - if any (I don't remember) - of anyone even attempting to create a rebellion of any sort, at least not since the Hunger Games have started. (The whole reason for the Hunger Games is because there was a failed rebellion attempt years earlier.)  Instead, I'm left with a lackluster ending that seemed to be built not around the Games themselves really, but around the theme of romance and betrayal. Peeta realizes that some of Katniss's affection towards him was contrived. I'm not sure why he would be so surprised, seeing how he was playing up that angle in the very beginning. But at the end of the book, he seems truly hurt and offended that Katniss would do such a thing to him. And for some reason, Katniss suddenly has mixed feelings about Peeta. I can believe that part to a certain extent because it would be natural for her to feel close to Peeta in the arena when he was the only one she could really trust. But her feelings seem to take a violent swing toward the other end of the spectrum as she rides that last train home, and it doesn't sit in my mind as all that believable.  I am debating on picking up the second book in this series. Some have told me it's better than the first book, but I don't know. Overall, The Hunger Games was a decent read, but it's another one of those books that makes me scratch my head and ponder why in the world it gained so much buzz - enough to be made into a movie and eventually grow into a worldwide phenomenon.  To sum it up, the book was okay. Surely not the phenomenon everyone has been raving about. It entertained me, had a lackluster and anti-climactic ending, and probably could have used a bit more filling to make the pie sweeter.
I heard a ton about The Hunger Games before I read it. A lot of people said it was really gruesome and intense--even more people said it was sad and heartbreaking. Personally, I didn't think it was particularly gruesome or heartbreaking. It felt like "Survivor" meets Lord of The Flies and the myth of the Minotaur. My familiarity with similar types of stories and knowledge about the plot going into the story contributed to my lack of shock while reading The Hunger Games.  Even though a lot of people thought that The Hunger Games was really gruesome, the fight scenes were not described in too much detail, so this was not a problem for me. The overall concept is, of course, appalling--but that is the point of the novel. No one goes into Lord of the Flies expecting it to be an uplifting story, and no one should go into The Hunger Games expecting a story filled with joy.  The deaths and tragedies of the story weren't particularly upsetting to me either. The majority of the players in the games weren't very developed. There was only one character that dies that I cared about, but I knew she was going to die so I did not let myself get too attached to her character.  The best part of the novel for me was definitely Peeta and Katniss. It was a joy to see their interactions. You can tell that Peeta truly loves Katniss, and even though Katniss is just playing the game, there is clearly potential for something beautiful to develop there.  Filled with the makings of a beautiful love story, a tragedy torn nation, and a lot of action, The Hunger Games is definitely a must read. Perfect for fans of "Survivor," Lord of The Flies, and the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, The Hunger Games has enough action and romance to leave you wanting more.
Okay, so I picked this up to read it because I'd heard about the movie coming out and wanted to see what the fuss is about.And I read right through it and through both sequels in pretty short order.  SPOILER ALERT: the book is a LOT better than the movie! Do yourself a favor and read the book, leave the movie for one of those nights you're flipping channels and can't find anything else to watch. Yes, the movie is that bad.  Which is a shame, because The Hunger Games is a book that seems ready-made for being made into a movie. One thing I will give Suzanne Collins credit for, she can write some very dramatic sequences. I read this book and thought, wow, I can't wait to see how that looks on the big screen. And I was terribly disappointed. The movie was just flat, flat, flat. If I'd seen the movie before reading the book, I probably wouldn't have bothered with the book.  For those that liked the movie, I will offer this example. Read the portion where Petra confesses his love of Katniss on Caesar's TV show. Now watch the movie version. Can you honestly say it is anywhere near as dramatic? I was stunned that the director ruined what was such a tailor-made moment. I could give a lot more examples.  Anyone with a lick of sense will see where this series is going but as has been said many times before, sometimes the fun is how you get there not where you end up! There is a fair amount of silliness, particularly the Twilight-like flailings of the protagonist and her inability to decide whether she loves Petra or Gale. And yet, the book does manage to hold your attention. And it has those wonderfully written dramatic moments!  What did I like? It's a quick read. The premise is interesting. Some dramatic moments that are very well written. I also appreciated the angst suffered by Katniss, both in this novel and the sequels, resulting from the killing she witnesses or is responsible for. Too many times novels like this tend to brush off violence and repercussions, the characters don't see to dwell on what they've done. This series, to it's credit, does not do that. Katniss suffers considerably for her choices and actions (as do some of the other victors).  Bottom line: it's a good summer beach read. The book is recommended, the movie is decidedly NOT.
This is definitely one of my favorite book series and my favorite book out of the series. I read this right when it came out and could not get enough of it. I have read the book twice and seen the movie twice. It's such an impacting story. I love how it is for all ages. Well adults and teens. I think it's a little too graphic for young kids. The story is exciting and new and keeps you on your toes the whole time. The story is unlike anything I've ever heard or imagined. Its fake but yet seems so real and could possibly happen. It's such an extravagant story and makes me wonder hoe the author came up with all these details. It's a story about the future, which is totally up my alley, but it's not just the typical futuristic, world-ending story. Its much more tan that. It's a twist on the future. About power, control, punishment, and entertainment. The typical rich get richer and poor get poorer motto. Although it takes place in the future part of it feels like the olden days. It has everything packed into this book. Drama, love, action, thrill, and adventure all make up this obsessive story. It's more than I ever thought it would ever be. It really pulls you into the story and at some points I even wished it were real. You get sucked in and don't want to put it down. I think I read the book in about 6 days. My favorite part in the book is the actual "hunger games". Its such a neat concept. It's cruel but powerful and goes into so much detail. The detail is what really gets me. Everything about this world and the games are strict and clean. There is a reason for everything and everything has a place. Everything in the world is so precise and creative and that is really portrayed in the book so that you can imagine it in your mind. After finishing the series and seeing the movie I became even more enthralled and went out and bought the extra books. Books that go into more detail about the world of the hunger games and the characters. The characters are amazing! They each have their own background story of how they became the person they are today. They are each so different but all blend together and connect with one another. Its almost like they fit like a puzzle. They play off each other and lean on one another and even fight and kill for one another. Its such a powerful story because even though Katniss and the rest of the poor districts are over powered by the rich, they take a stand and fight for their rights. They are treated like crap, yet stay so strong and continuing doing their best so that they don't lose. There is not one thing in this book that I didn't like. Not to mention that its an easy read and everything is understandable and portrayed in a simple relaxed way.
I was lent this book and was told it had a teen genre to it. I gave it a read anyhow and was glad I did.  I was pleasantly surprised, with the riveting story of a future which is dark, sad, and bleak. The great continent of North America is no more. Instead we have the country of Panem, 12 districts and the Capitol City. In district 12, which is in the former Appalachian region of coal mining we have the story of a girl becoming a woman in the most harsh of circumstances.  She lives in a future where 2 young contestants from each district are chosen annually for a fight to the death in the Hunger Games of Capitol City. The games are televised &amp; there is but one winner.  Katniss is our protagonist here. She volunteers to take her younger sister's place at the Games.  With one victor, one would think the plot pretty much cut and dried, as in the old Gladiator days of yore. We all make choices in our lives, this young woman is compelled to choose in a world gone mad. Government has decided that these barbaric games take place to keep an already down-trodden populace in their place and under the government's thumb. Nicely written, a page turner is how I felt about this novel. It had been loaned to my Kindle from a friend. No question it has a teen slant being told from the young lady's perspective in her own narration. Young love is involved in the storyline as well. Or is it? Being pretty far removed from my teen years, I enjoyed this novel thoroughly and have bought the next 2 installments of the trilogy. It's not just for young people at all. Ms. Collins has seen to that very well.  This idea has been tried many times before in novel and movie form. This version from Ms. Collins shines brightly.
Let me start off by telling a little about myself.  I am a 45 year old male who is not an avid reader.  I read a lot in support of my profession, but it is definitely work reading and not reading for pleasure.  I guess I read so much at work, the last thing I want to do outside of work is read.  However, I do read for pleasure periodically.  When I do, I am very selective.  I prefer fantasy and sci-fi.  If you read some of my other reviews, you will see that I also enjoy role playing video games.  I like to escape in my entertainment. As with the games I enjoy, with books I prefer authors who can build a world and suck me into it.  I prefer complex stories with exquisite detail woven in a creative way such that it compels me to continue reading for hours at a time. I consider Tolkien to be the master in this regard; the one author who writes perfectly for me.  This is my first book review on Amazon.  That said, I had no intention of reading this book; none whatsoever until I saw the movie on an international flight recently.  I was intrigued by the movie, and thought there was a lot that felt "missing" that the book would most certainly clear up. I asked my oldest if she had the book...she did...I borrowed it.  When I asked her what she thought about it, she said it was good.  When she doesn't add a bunch of details, I know that she only thought the book was OK...not something she'd read twice (and she reads almost everything more than once). I asked if she had the other two books..."no"...another indicator she was not excited about The Hunger Games.  The story is very good.  It is fairly simple, given the audience, but I think it may be too simple.  For example, Harry Potter was geared towards a slightly younger audience, and I feel that it is a tad more sophisticated in style and content than The Hunger Games.  There are a lot of fragments.  I mean a lot.  If you are the slightest bit OCD about grammar you will not like this book.  I've also run into several copy-edit errors as well (I have the paperback edition with the movie tie-in cover), of course that is not Collins' fault.  Unfortunately, I think the author leaves too much to the reader to figure for themselves.  There is a fine balance when building a world and a story, and that balance is easily skewed, and I would expect an experience author such as Collins to have a better grasp on the process.  A friend of mine rationalized it to me that we are actually reading the story from Katniss' perspective, and thus the reader is only getting what she sees and understands.  This is a fair review, and one that certainly makes sense given the way the story unfolds.  I still think that the story is a good one.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and have ordered the next two books in the series.  I am betting most people will really like this book.  It is an easy read, despite the herky-jerky fragments, and it really does pull you in.  Like Stephen King said in his review "Addictive...I could not stop reading."  You will find yourself rooting for Katniss, I promise.
Katniss is a young lady who is the sole caretaker of her family. She lives with her younger sister, Prim, and her Mother. They live in Panem, which is ruled by the Capital. They live in District 12 where they make coal. Katniss and her best friend, Gale, go hunting outside of the district on a regular basis to feed their families and to trade for other goods.  Every year the Capital reminds the districts that they are in control by conducting the Hunger Games. Every child between the ages of 12 and 18 must put their name into a bowl at least once; they can put their name in more often for additional rations of food. The Capital picks one boy and one girl from each district to compete in the games. The games are televised and everyone in Panem is required to watch. The 24 children are placed in an arena and are forced to fight to the death until only one remains.  When the names are called for District 12, Prim's name is called. Katniss cannot allow her to go, so she volunteers. A boy named Peeta, who Katniss has always been grateful to because he gave her bread at a time she didn't think she would live, is also called for the games.  Peeta plays the audience by telling them that he has had an unrequited love for Katniss for as long as he remembers. The games begin and the excitement mounts. Katniss finds herself thinking of both Gale and Peeta and a possible love triangle ensues. With only one winner, there is no way that Peeta and Katniss can both come out alive, or is there?  This is the first book of a trilogy. Initially I read this book only to see what all the hype was about, as I don't typically read fantasy books. This was a pleasant surprise. The tale starts with love of a young girl for her sister that is strong enough for her to give her own life. The whirlwind of the days before the games, then the action during the games, add a touch of romance (for the ladies), and it makes for a great read! I highly recommend this book and will definitely be reading the next two in the series.
I originally purchased this for my daughter, and when she was done with it, said `Mom, you NEED to read this!'  So, I listened to my 15 year old, and I'm glad I did!  The book takes place in a North America that has been destroyed and is now run by the powerful Capital and is divided into 12 districts (district 13 has been destroyed due to a rebellion). In district 12 ace hunter Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl, carves out a meager existence for herself, her younger sister Prim and their widowed mother. In order to keep the 12 districts aware of who runs the county, the Capital arranges a game to the death each year in an elaborate arena. Each district holds a drawing of one boy and one girl to go as tributes. When her sister is picked, Katniss exercises her option to volunteer for the games. Along with Katniss comes also Peeta, the baker's son, who grew up with her.  Katniss and Peeta must fend for themselves against natural elements, the Gamemakers and the other contestants whose only option is to kill or be killed.  So the book sounds simple enough, but also hits many themes including teenage anguish, love, work, poverty and more.  It was an easy and quick read, as well as full of action.  Now, anyone that has read my other reviews knows I compare almost everything to perhaps the best book I've read in a LONG while, Jonas Hyde's, Melpomene's Tears Melpomene's Tears.  While The Hunger Games hits nowhere near the emotional cords that Hyde's work does, it is definitely more easily digested.  As a whole, it is also much better than 50 Shades.  So, if you're looking for a quick read, check this out.  If you want something more heartfelt, go check out Hyde's work.  Either way, you will enjoy them both!
Okay, so I finally broke down and read this book.  Honestly, its a decent book, but I have no clue what all the hype is about...  The story is about a teenager in a future world where America is now broken up into Districts that are ruled by the Capitol.  As part of their punishment for rising up against their rulers, the Hunger Games are played.  Teenagers are picked by a lottery from the Districts and are forced to fight to the death in a dangerous outdoor arena.  The odds are stacked against them because the people running the Games keep changing things to keep it interesting for the viewers.  The main character, Katniss, volunteers to go in stead of her younger sister and Peeta is the male chosen from the same District.  Its obvious to the reader that he loves her, but she takes a long time to figure that out and even longer to realize that she has feelings for him.  They are billed as a love interest during the Game, the first ever.  Overall, its not a bad read...save that its hard to like many of the characters because they come off a bit flat.  The Game itself is predictible.  Perhaps I expected too much, but if this book hinted at the end that this would lead into Katniss becoming the head of a revolution against the Captiol, then I would be happier with it.  I haven't read the second book, so perhaps that's where the author is heading.  My main concern with this is the idea of having teenagers playing a "Game" where they murder each other.  Yes, this is a future world where life seems cheap at times, but one wonders at what impression this gives to teenagers who read it.  There also didn't seem much in the way of explanation over why the Districts were closed off from the surrounding countryside where there was, obviously, still food to be had.  Or why they weren't allowed to farm.  Perhaps, if it had been made clear that areas of the land were radioactive or something?  But there was no sense of this.  Was this just a means of the Capitol further controlling them?  That wasn't made clear if so.  And why keep a population hungry when it doesn't have to be...that's just asking for trouble in the long run.  I did enjoy the book for what it was.  But its just an okay book in my mind.  Not something I would necessarily recommend to anyone under the age of 16 or 17 due to the teenager on teenager violence that, honestly, we don't need to glorify.
While not a terrible book, I did not find this novel to be that entertaining. I held off reading it amidst the movie hype as I figured it was a mindcandy sort of read and I really did not want yet another cheap paperback book cluttering my already cluttered bookshelves. However, with the Kindle app on my tablet I was willing to give it a go in a digital format (which was actually very well done).  The Hunger Games was not a bad book, but it's really not a good book either. Set in a dystopic future where the country has fallen apart and been rebuilt as a totalitarian state, the book has an interesting setting. 'The Capitol,' which sounds like West Hollywood relocated to Denver or Aspen, demands a tribute of children from subject territories and then makes the kids fight each other to the death.  It's an interesting setting, but is executed with clunky prose and a  predictable plot. From the first few pages, you have a pretty good idea which characters will survive and that the status quo will be shaken up in the process. I suppose the target market is young adults in their tween years, so perhaps they will enjoyful the color descriptions of the capitol and the "Running Man" premise which Collins has repackaged for children. The melodramatic moments of death and separation seemed forced and campy to me, but a younger audience might appreciate it more.  Parents should feel okay in letting their children read this. I did not find the book to be that disturbing even though it is about... well, children murdering each other. But if parents are looking to give their children a taste of good, accessible science fiction tales, I would recommend Ender's Game or The Giver far more than these books. Now those are classics.  I would give this book 2.5 stars if I could. But I can't quite bring myself to give it three. If you're interested in this book, read it now. Because in a few years (after the sequels have been made into movies) no one will really care anymore. Mass market fiction at it's best and worst.
Hunger Games is the first of the trendy trinity (Harry Potter, and Twilight), that I decided to read. I had no idea what the story was, and was informed by a friend that it was Dystopian - and not absolute fairy tale escapism like the previous mentioned books - and the movie was fantastic. I chose to see the movie with some friends, and was impressed enough to purchase the book.  First of all, this book deserves serious credit for extrapolating into the future just how limitless our puerile desire for `reality TV' will take us. First contestants merely quizzed each other for money to entertain us (The Newly Wed Game, Family Feud, etc). Then they began to kick and punch each other (WWF). Now they frequently humiliate themselves into a point of no dignity (Every reality show presently out). And in the future, they will kill each other.  Of course in order to coerce 28 people into killing each other, you need an omnipresent and oppressive state, which brutalizes the lives of the poor, and keeps them separated in their division of labor from meeting and communicating with others. Although this is a sci-fi novel, it does take place in America, and it's not entirely improbable to envision the descriptions of each poor district as the future description of each actual American district.  This is ultimately the world of Panem: America after another civil war, where the poor lose, and the rich choose to humiliate them, and defile their dignity, by making 2 members of each district fight to the death on live television. Of course, the state is careful to propagandize this point as a rewarding tradition, which bestows honor and glory on the winners, and reminds the poor of why they need the Capitol in the first place.  For a novel aimed at teenagers I like the message, and the implication. This is certainly a superior choice for a teenager, over 1984, or Animal Farm, whose implicit USSR references would be totally lost on our youth; moreover, those novels fail to criticize the trajectory of American, and only the former trajectory of a different failed state.  Nonetheless, this book still only warrants four stars for several reasons. One, the movie, which was written by the author, offers a narrative that isn't entirely 1st person, in the main characters head, and I think ultimately this broadened the available options of exploring Panem, and different districts (The revolt in district 11 in the film could not happen in the book). Second, it is clearly written for teenagers, and I'm not the target audience. Only so much satisfaction can be derived from reading extremely simple prose, and teenage relational sentiments, where kissing and holding hands are momentous events in a post-puberty state of being.  Finally, I have a reactionary grievance that's two sided... First, when I hear people in the theater or in the book store talking about this book, all I here is the same old banal tripe: "It's so good." "I loved it." Nothing about the actual critique of the American state, environmental, and welfare policy, or the NEED to revolt against those who exploit economically, and psychology. Comments on state based ideology are entirely lacking, and I sincerely doubt reality TV viewership has taken a hit. Instead, this novel aimed at teens, with a serious message, is being consumed by adults, with the reading comprehension level, and moral integrity, of a grapefruit. Second, I suppose that's why the three biggest hits (Harry Potter, Twilight) are aimed at kids, yet sweep our countries, and in general must contain a sci-fi escapism element, just to rouse people away from the TV or the People Magazine, in order to give reading `another try.'  I realize these are not directly criticisms that should detract from my review of the content of the book, but I couldn't help feeling this constant annoyance while reading that: the content is being lost, like all popular rebellion in capitalism, the message and content are commoditized and drained of their non-exchange-value (Think everything John Lennon ever wrote solo). Rebellion is consumption, consumption is rebellion, and soon we'll be consuming the cable channels that air the deaths of our community, if we aren't careful.
As a reader: Suzanne Collins had a number of successful young adult books prior to The Hunger Games, so I was not surprised when a few of my students recommend the title to me. I never expected, though, to be blown away with the sophistication of the writing and the themes. This is one of those rare books that speaks to readers of all ages and all genders. It is a twisted love story, a wrenching coming-of-age tale, and an action-packed adventure. What makes it truly a gem, though, is how it uses a futuristic setting to force readers into examining so many aspects of contemporary society. I instantly fell in love with Katniss, who narrates this book and the others in the trilogy. She is the epitome of an unreliable narrator, yet she is so strong that you find yourself believing even what you know is likely untrue. The supporting characters in the book are equally wonderful. They are flawed and unique, and Collins unfolds each carefully over the course of the book and trilogy, so that every page offers new insight into someone.  As a writer: I was into book three before I realized what was off about the writing of these books. They are written in first person present tense, a very rare narration choice, but one that works for these books. First, it builds suspense; you can't assume Katniss will survive the way you could in a first person narration told in past tense. Second, Collins clearly is a master at it. The fact that such a unique form of writing can go unnoticed means the author is skilled in her craft. The reader is so in Katniss's head that it doesn't seem at all unnatural that the story would be told in present tense. As mentioned above, Collins is also a master of characterization. She creates a world where a large chunk of the characters, those from the Capital, could seem outrageous and unbelievable. She described them, after all, to look the way one might picture the performers in a Cirque du Soleil show, yet as we meet each, we love or loathe them for their personalities alone. The final skill I envy Collins for is her world creation. As I mentioned above, this is not an author who is new to fantasy writing, but the detail with which she describes this world and the various settings, creatures, and technology is amazing.  Bottom line: I think I've gushed enough. Read it for yourself. Read it to your kids. Read it with your students. You won't need me to tell you it is worth the all-nighter.
I was a little late to the Hunger Games as I did not read the book until after I saw the movie.  I was pleased with the film; however, it seemed obvious in parts that the book goes into greater detail.  As I was reading the book I found this to be true with the most notable examples being the sponsor gifts and the history of Panem.  The Hunger Games is meant to shock you.  24 children and young adults put in an arena with the goal of outlasting everyone else by either killing them or surviving while your opponents succumb to the element.  I like Katniss as a character.  She is smart and does what you would think a normal person would do put in her situation.  The Hunger Games is also littered with other memorable characters such as Haymitch, Cinna, and President Snow to name just a few.  Another high point of the novel comes with the emotions that are channeled to you through the characters.  What Katniss thinks about people in the Capital and how she reacts was almost exactly how I felt while reading.  I felt a connection with Katniss and genuinely cared what was going to happen to her.  The Hunger Games is meant to shock you.  Unfortunately the shock value has been a part of the hype and it elevates a good book into a cultural phenomenon.  There are some problems with the book, with perhaps the largest one being contestants in the Hunger Games forming alliances with one another.  Some, like Katniss and Rue, and Katniss and Peeta, make sense however some of the other alliances were such unintelligent decisions by the characters it is hard to believe someone would actually do it.  Another issue I had was how the book ended.  While the ending itself was satisfying it did feel a little rushed and anti-climactic.  It seemed like the Hunger Games ended and the book was over 5 pages later with, in my opinion, some very important parts being summed over in a few sentences.  All in all the Hunger Games is a very good novel that does a good job at keeping your attention.  I finished the book in a little less than a week and probably could have got through it faster if not for outside factors.  The author writes a compelling story with real fleshed-out characters and leaves me eager to dive into Catching Fire.
The Hunger Games...what can I say? I'm somewhat hesitant to admit to enjoying this book...but honestly, I found it quite interesting and very intriguing. The subject matter is abominable when you think about it, yet for a generation that's been raised on reality shows where it's common-place to eliminate a player each week, The Hunger Games definitely has a familiar feel. The main difference here is that the players are reluctant children, and failure means death instead of simply being "voted out".  Katniss is likeable and easy to sympathize with; she's been through tougher times than most of us will ever know, but she's a fighter and is full of determination. Family is extremely important to her, in fact she breaks the law nearly every day just to feed her mother and sister. (It's actually her love for her sister that brings Katniss into the Hunger Games, she basically sacrifices herself to take her sister's place.) Katniss doesn't believe the structure and actions of her government are correct, and she knows the whole ideal of the Hunger Games is warped.... however, the Capitol City has zero tolerance for rebellion or protests of any kind, so Katniss keeps her beliefs to herself, knowing she would be killed for speaking them out loud.  Peeta, who is the other tribute (or player) in the Games from Katniss's district, is also very interesting to watch. There's much more to him than you might think at first glance. He has the ability to evoke such a wide range of emotions from me...a couple times his actions confused me, giving me pause to ponder his intentions, but other times I felt sadness and sympathy for him, and still other times he had me smiling in silent laughter. He's an excellent character, and I really enjoyed how he and Katniss played off each-other.  For those wondering about the gore and violence factor, obviously just from reading the synopsis you can tell this is not a "warm and fuzzy" book...but in my opinion, considering the extreme subject matter, it's handled fairly well. There is violence and gore, but I wouldn't call it gratuitous or drawn-out; it was actually milder than I expected. The entire story is told from Katniss's perspective; she has limited contact with most of the players (many she doesn't even know their names), and thankfully she isn't present every time a player is eliminated.  I can definitely see why The Hunger Games has everyone's attention. It's extremely intriguing and you just can't help but want/need to know what will happen next. I hesitate to associate the word "entertaining" with it, but honestly, it really is. It's a picture of a warped futuristic version of Survivor, in a society where life has no value and the government has complete and total reign over the people. Katniss knows things aren't right, and I'm really looking forward to seeing if she's somehow able to bring change to her world over the course of the next two books.
In the future, North America has transformed itself into a country known as Panem.  Twelve districts, whose populations are in general underfed, produce different products (coal, agricultural goods, etc.) to serve the needs of the central city known as Capitol.  To keep the twelve outlying districts under Capitol's heel, every year each of the districts is required to select two tributes -- one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen -- to fight it out in a televised to-the-death free-for-all known as the Hunger Games.  Twenty-four kids placed in an arena disguised to look like a natural landscape spend approximately two weeks hunting each other down until only one survives.  The winner, along with their home district, are lavished with wealth and prizes.  The Hunger Games were created by Capitol after it suppressed an organized uprising of the districts many decades before.  The author makes it clear that the Games are generally reviled by the inhabitants of the outlying districts.  But under the memory of the failed rebellion and Capitol's continued repression, there is little the districts appear to be able to do.  Enter Katniss Everdeen.  After her younger sister is selected for the Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  Thrust into the myriad preparations for the games, Katniss must cope with the alien environment of Capitol and must quickly adapt to navigate her way through the Games' preparations.  As if this is not enough, Katniss must also cope with some mixed feelings about her district's male tribute, Peeta Mellark.  But Capitol and its many differences to her home district along with any mixed feelings she has about Peeta quickly fade when the twenty-four tributes enter the arena.  Because in the arena, everyone is an enemy and Katniss will have to keep all of her wits about her to try and stay alive...  I'll admit, Hunger Games turned about better than I was expecting it to be.  The characters are engaging and believable.  Katniss is a strong heroine.  And where the author really went right with this book is that we get to know Katniss so well that when she is thrust into the horrific environment of the arena the vile nature of the games is graphically emphasized.  How can anyone do this to kids??  But the author left the story wanting in other areas.  Primarily, I really wanted to get to know Katniss's home district -- District 12 -- better before she was pulled from it and thrust into the bewildering environment of Capitol.  I wanted more about its people and its past...perhaps some enticing tidbits about their role in the rebelling decades earlier that led to the Games and would serve as a strong connection to home when Katniss is fighting for her life in the arena.  Instead, the entire focus is on the Games for much of the book and Panem's -- as well District 12's -- history is left by the wayside, hopefully to be picked up again and fleshed out in much greater detail in the subsequent books of the trilogy.  Nonetheless, the story of Panem is thoroughly engaging and I can easily understand why it has connected with so many readers already.  I look forward to picking up the next two books in the near future.
NOTE: I read this a few years ago. *Way* before a movie was planned.  Surprisingly, I wasn't too keen to start it. I don't know why, I was just hesitant. But as soon as I read that first sentence, I was somehow hooked.  And that first sentence, that one sentence, was all it took for me.  I think it was Collins' writing that first drew me in. The detail and emotions she describes - it just sent shivers up my back.  Katniss, I feel, is a cunning and strong female character. Now-a-days, we rarely see a girl like her. Most authors aren't interested in a strong woman hence why we have characters like Bella from twilight*, Jacinda from Firelight and Sam from Shiver**. Katniss, for me, was always the one saving Peeta or some other guy's skin.  Speaking of which, I must mention my adoration for the little bakery-boy. Is it just me, or is he Katniss' puppy? He follows her around the place, wanting to be loved by her. I found it quite cute! And I thought that Peeta was very nice and kind. (but I didn't like the way he joined up with Cato and co.)  Gale on the other hand...well, I liked him in the first book - short as his appearance is - but when I travelled deeper into the trilogy I found myself loathing him. But, since I'm not reviewing the second and third book, I'll just say that Gale was a short and likable presence (in the first book). ***  *When Edward broke up with Bella, she laid on the forest floor, in a ball, and cried herself to sleep. Twi-hards please face facts; that's NOT the characteristics of a strong woman.  **No, that's not a mistake.  ***By the way; THE TWO GUYS WHO PLAYS PEETA AND GALE IN THE MOVIE ARE DELICIOUS.  The romance isn't important in this book (thank the gods), it's a nice little thing to add for good measure, but that's all it is; a little thing. Katniss is a little too busy keeping herself and Peeta alive to sit all-day and kiss him.  The world-building, I shall admit, is not original. Teens killing each other? Where have I heard that...oh yes; Battle Royal. The bloodiest book I have ever read in YA. I was a little upset at the start that Collins has the same idea as Takami, but around the middle of the book I began to realize something; a lot of books are the same in some ways. And so what if they have the same concept? As long as it's good, why should you care?  NOTE: I did read Hunger Games &amp; Battle Royal. And I love both equally.  Suzanne Collins has written a fantastic novel, I can tell that in the future; it will be written down in history with Harry Potter.Hence why I have rated it 5.  However, there was only one thing - only one mind you! - that bothered me. And that was Foxface. Being a large Foxface fan, I was gutted that Collins decided to kill her off so suddenly and so easily. Foxface was clever, sneaky and had slyness about her. She had great potential. So why did Collins make her death an `unfortunate mishap'? I do hope that the Suicide Theory for Foxface is true, because if Collins does deny those facts (and to my knowledge, she hasn't): I will change my star rating.
WARNING:  CONTAINS SPOILERS  Oh boy.  I finally see why this book is so popular.  I have been told to read this book by several people, sites, forums, recommendation engines... I finally got around to doing so.  There was a lot I liked about this book.  The most obvious thing that drew me to it was that it was a well-recommended dystopian book with a thrilling survival element.  Once I started reading it, the excitement and emotional involvement kept me coming back.  The survival part of the Games was well-written and entertaining.  I liked the twist of the beasts at the end, as it helps demonstrate how truly sadistic the Capitol is as a whole.  I really enjoyed the character of Katniss.  She is refreshingly self-sufficient and defiant.  I enjoy a good heroine who can hold her own against the best of them, especially when she uses her wits as a weapon.  While Katniss herself feels that she is often uncaring, I think she was just the right level of caring.  She cares for her sister enough to volunteer as tribute in her place, essentially sacrificing her life for Prim's.  She has love for her father in her memories.  She appears to hate her mother on the surface for shutting down and failing to care for the family, but we see glimpses in which Katniss does indeed still love her too.  She cares for Gale.  She cares for Rue deeply, associating her with Prim and trying her best to protect her and avenge her when she fails to do so.  And she does care for Peeta.  I found myself able to relate to Katniss surprisingly well with her dealings with Peeta.  Her thoughts about Peeta's actions really tugged on my heartstrings.  When he would do something kind for her, she would repeatedly think that he was just playing into the "starcrossed lover act" that she thought Haymitch concocted.  Any time she started to feel something, she kept reminding herself that it was just part of the Games, that it wasn't real.  This relates to me on a personal level, because I have some major issues with trust.  This is particularly true with men, and particularly so where relationships are concerned.  Every time she doubted Peeta's motives, I could feel myself in her shoes.  Every time half of me was like "can't you see, Katniss?", the other half of me was thinking that I have probably very similarly, maybe just as foolishly, disbelieved someone whose motivations were genuine.  Although the end left a lot of conflict unresolved (obviously opening for a sequel), I enjoyed what did occur.  I appreciated how Katniss started distancing herself from Peeta on the way home, because she was entirely under the belief that everything that occurred between them was just part of the Games.  I liked Peeta's cold, biting reaction to her hurting him, and I very much look forward to seeing what occurs between them, and between the other characters when the District 12 victors return home.
Unlike some readers, I had the pleasure of meeting this book after I saw the movie. And I have not read the 2 other books. Usually before I write a review, I make a point of reading all of the previous reviews of the book on this site. Unfortunately the sheer mass of these makes this impractical. So I might be stating views already given, but here goes.  The most interesting aspect of what reviews I did read were those by people negative. Like KMR, who suggested that "the premise ... lacks authenticity" and "the people of Panem are so resigned ... they never question it" and "in 74 years, not even one tribute has questioned the mandate". But look at our own unlamented North Korea. Under a stifling and near absolute dictatorship that harks back to 1945 when World War 2 ended 67 years ago. Where in the last 20 years a famine killed over a million people. Yet no rebellion. The 67 year Korean rule is not so far from the 74 years of the Hunger Games. Perhaps the reviewer should be more cognisant of actual history.  Then there is the reviewer Pseudotriakis, who opined that "the book is boring". Here the overwhelming mass of readers would absolutely disagree. As you can see by trolling the reviews, most found it gripping. And that is the verdict of the marketplace, based on the book's success. Plus, the movie was a faithful rendition of the book, as stated by the author herself. The movie was a smash for 2012. Which goes to show that the book was not boring.  Further, Pseudotriakis ventures that "Even when she is forced to kill, she feels little or no remorse"... "The author never lets her kill pre-emptively, only allowing her to act in self defense". The reviewer lacks enough introspection to see that he is largely answering his own question. The reason that Katniss feels no remorse is basically because she killed in self defense. Though I suggest that the author did this precisely to avoid the harder issue of how to depict the character if she had indeed killed several opponents, especially if this was done deliberately. If you read the book and think back slowly over the tournament events, you might get an extra appreciation for what Collins did and her skill as a writer. For all of the action and deaths, Katniss manages to segue aside. This lets her emerge at the end not as a hardened stone cold killer, and much easier for the reader to identify with.  I suggest that overall the critical comments about the society or societies in the book inadvertently show the author's constraint. She built this out into 2 more books where she fleshed out those facets. Including from what I can gather in the blurbs, where indeed people rebel against Panem. If she had put these into the current book, it would have made for a far longer text. Keep in mind one practical factor. This first book was market speculation by the author, as it really is for any author. She did not know how well it would be received. Investing too much time in a huge tome that was all 3 novels would have been a big risk of her time. Likely too that the publisher would have baulked at backing it.  Hey, if you liked this novel, there is another story about a death match that starts with 64 gladiators in a future world. Each paired with an opponent and in every round half the players die, until only 1 is left. Berserker's Planet by Fred Saberhagen. Not as successful in the marketplace. Mostly perhaps because the characters in that book exhibit far less empathy than Hunger Games. The biggest differences with Hunger Games are that those fighters enter the contest willingly and can be of any age. If the combat premise of Collins was interesting and you want more, try that book. It is also a reminder that Collins certainly did not invent the idea of a death match with only one winner. Surely there are other books of death matches, but the Saberhagen text is what I've read.  Another book recommendation that will be more germane to some readers is the companion text about the filming of the movie, The Hunger Games: Official Illustrated Movie Companion. Well composed and gives a cool backstory about the travails of filming in the forests of North Carolina.
From my blog:  This is one of the books that I received for my birthday which was only a couple weeks ago and I read it in the span of a few days. I would have read it faster if school didn't get in my way so much, but the speed bumps did let me savor the story a bit more. I had heard wonderful things about this book and was excited to read it and am happy to report that it lived up to expectations. There is a movie coming out soon (or it might already be out by the time this is posted) based on the book and I'm looking forward to seeing how they pull off all the places that special effects could be awesome.  Title: The Hunger Games  Author: Suzanne Collins  Pages: 374 paperback  Setting: Panem is what is left of North America after a series of extreme weather, earth quakes and civil unrest changed the face of our planet. The Capitol rules over 12 Districts in a brutally unfair government where people in the districts are always starving and people in the Capitol live in luxury as long as they don't say anything against the Capitol.  Premise: In this dystopia the Capitol does many things to keep the districts in line, one of which is the Hunger Games. Every year one girl and one boy between 12-18 are chosen from each district to compete to the death in a survival arena that is completely controlled by the Gamemakers who want the show to be compelling for the entire nation watching live. Katniss Everdeen ends up being one of the two from her district, though her district hasn't won in the last decade or more so things don't look very good....  Strengths:  The pace is surprisingly well done for a story that is about a non-stop fight for survival; I normally get stressed out with those sorts of stories but found this very well paced  The story is written in first person present tense, which is at first a little weird, but it fits nicely once you get used to it  Some wonderful supporting characters who really come alive despite the story being told in first person  Collins uses the tech of this futuristic society in interesting ways and has some fun new ideas for what a futuristic society looks like  Weaknesses:  I didn't get all that attached to Katniss despite her being the main character; I ended up caring a lot more about various supporting characters  The teenage angst gets a bit annoying because of Katniss' density towards human interactions  The book ends on teenage angst, which I just really hated, and I'm not planning to read the next book specifically because it picks up exactly where this one ended  The book takes place almost entirely in the Games, which is appropriate given the title, but I wish I could learn more about the rest of the world  Summary:  I did really enjoy this book as evidenced by the fact that I tore through it so quickly. It isn't too hard of a read since it's obviously aimed at a young adult audience, but it is still emotionally captivating for an older audience if you can ignore the angsty parts. It's great for trips since you'll totally forget about your three hour plane ride, though if you cry at books, you'll probably cry a little. I really wish the next books had more compelling plots, but from talking to people and reading summaries, it feels like Collins is trying to stretch this good idea into too long of a series, which is disappointing given the interesting things that can happen in dystopias run by corrupt governments. I would love to hear people's opinion on the next books though if anyone has read them! What are you most looking forward to about the movie if you've read this book?  More reviews at[...]
I read everything and anything I can get my hands on. So naturally, with Harry Potter sadly over and Twilight in the midst of fizzing out and dying even before the final and most "epic" movie yet comes out, The Hunger Games is a welcome invitation to move on and find a geat new trilogy and series. I will read eveything that beomes so popular only because I don't want to miss anything great and try not to listen to people who hate the books (ex: Twilight).  The Hunger Games had such a great plot. The author was halfway there with that. She could have done SO MUCH MORE and in my opinion failed miserably at writing a compelling series. I think the only moment I liked the main character Katniss, was when she volunteered for the games so her sister wouldn't have to. That was it. After that, she immediately got on my nerves and I never felt like I cared what happened to any of them. The feel of the whole book, was that is was written in a way that the author hoped to get a movie deal out of it. She could have elaborated so much more about things, making the characters more real, and still would have gotten her movie deal so I barely even consider this to be a real book. It reads more like a blabbering screenplay.  It's disappointing because the plot is a great idea. Was she the first to do something like this? No. But that doesn't matter when a great author writes a book. Harry wasn't the first wizard ever created on a page but he came to life and now no one will forget him. Even in Twilight, the vampires are real to the reader, whether or not you think the writing is good. These books Suzanne Collins wrote are so different. Somehow she writes fast paced and you can read it quickly, but there was never a point where I was concerned for anyone and despite the highly controversial/barbaric story line of what happens, it still didn't make me FEEL anything. Taking into account what these books were about, that's really saying something.  And Katniss, why are you constantly staring at the screen or mirror and all of you including yourself are "mesmerized" by you? And why when you were in the games, were you always acting for the camera, smiling in a sly way, calling for Peeta because it will seem like the right thing to do, and always saying so confidently, surely, every camera is on ME right now. Again and again. Are you a narcissist Katniss? I think so.  To me, the is a MAJOR issue and flaw with a book/series. The whole point is to lose yourself in a story and escape to another world. I could never forget I was sitting on my couch reading this.  As for the rule breaking, Suzanne Collins is not the first to have holes in her story. She did change the rules of the games 3 times I think which is a bit ridiculous but I get why she did it. If they never changed it to district partners winning together, and then back again, Katniss and Peeta would never have decided to "check out" together at the end of the games. But she could have acheived this ending without changing the rules..if only the characters had some substance and personalities. Every book has holes, Lord of The Rings, Frodo could have just flown to Mordor with Gandolf on an eagle and the whole journey would never have happened. In Harry Potter, Gobet of Fire anyone? Harry didn't need to win the Tri-Wizard tournament to get to the graveyard. It's hard to find a perfect book with no holes at all. But other authors manage to make it not matter, the book is so good, you let it slide. This book however was the opposite. I'm going to flat out say I changed the rules, wait i'm changing them again, now one more time because third times the charm. Suzanne Collins only put enough effort into this to get it into the movies. And probably this series will be one of those where the movie is actually better then the books.  That's not supposed to happen Suzanne Collins.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  Ok, ok, ok, ok!  I jumped on the band wagon.  I admit it!  See, I wasn't going to read the series.  In fact, it sounded a bit too violent for my taste.  Plus, I don't really like becoming a bandwagon fan.  But, I was taken on a date (he was nice, didn't go anywhere though) and we saw the movie.  So, I figured I should go ahead and read the books.  I mean, why not?  Especially when I could check The Hunger Games out for free from Amazon Prime.  So, I did!  And, I was pretty hooked, no lie!  So, I was right, the series is pretty dark and a bit brutal.  Many of you may be familiar with the concept, but I will write a brief recap.  Set in the future when everything has changed, now where North America stood is the country of Panem.  The "life" of the country is in the Capitol, where the wealthy (and rather frivolous and silly) live.  And party.  They're the kind of people who don't get up before 10am.  Before noon, really, if they don't have to.  They lavish themselves in wealth, luxuries and outrageous hairstyles and clothing.  But "layering" out from the Capitol are districts.  12 of them, to be exact though there used to be 13).  Once upon a time, approximately 74 years ago, District 13 was obliterated by the Capitol when they attempted to rebel from the leadership of the Capitol.  Now, as penance for their transgressions, each District is required to send two tributes to the annual Hunger Games.  The tributes are one male and one female between the ages of 12-18.  Once selected, the tributes must battle to the death in an arena created by the Gamemakers, until only one tribute is left standing.  The Capitol insists on this as a form of "entertainment" but really, it is to keep the Districts in line.  Most districts are poverty stricken, and in order to receive the basic necessities at time, potential tributes can accept rations from the Capitol in exchange for having their name entered additional times in the drawing for tribute.  This year, at the 74th annual Hunger Games, we meet Katniss Everdeen, whose younger sister Prim, must be entered into the drawing for the first time.  At the ceremony, called the Reaping, much to Katniss' dismay, Prim's name is drawn.  In a moment of shock, terror and desperation, Katniss steps forward to be the female tribute from District 12, the coal miner's district, in place of her sister.  The book is a first-person account of Katniss Everdeen's experiences in the 74th Annual Hunger Games as she is forced to be a pawn in the Capitol's annual "sporting event."  Will Katniss survive against the tributes from the other districts?  Even against the so-called "Career tributes" from the districts wealthy enough to train some of their children to be tributes?  Will Katniss' family face the loss of their daughter, and how will District 12 respond if they lose Katniss?  Or will something different happen?  Unanticipated by the Gamemakers, to set the 74th annual Hunger Games apart in history?  Read The Hunger Games to find out!  I have to admit, seeing the movie first, then reading the book is quite a different experience for me.  I was unable to get the visions of the actors out of my mine while reading the books.  Luckily, the actress who played Katniss was fantastic!  Honestly, first-person narration generally is not my favorite.  I much prefer third-person narration, so it took a while to get used to the style of the book.  I honestly think that the written version of Katniss was a good character but a bit dry.  The ability to supplement her character with the actress' interpretation is what really helped the character come alive for me.  She might have been a tad bit dry had I not had that supplementation.  However, the author, Suzanne Collins, paints a great picture of a futuristic world, one where a "President" reigns in terror and absolute control over the subsidiaries, and forces them to battle to the death yearly to maintain order.  It's a terrifying notion, that seems scarily possible at times.  Like the kind of future that could exist when power runs unchecked.  Luckily the book was a little less bloody than I had imagined, making it readable for me.  Because honestly, I can't handle lots of blood and gore.  That being said, it's still not great content for a younger audience because of the theme of young adults/children brutally murdering other young adults/children.  Katniss is shown to be a resourceful and strong contender, but she has to face an arena that has other competitors that have trained their entire lives for their moment in the arena.  This compelling tale is intriguing and also warns of the dangers of too much power, and how horribly a dictatorial government can cause the lives of the every day person to be.  All in all, I say 4 out of 5 stars!
I read this book a few years ago for a school book club, then decided to give it a reread when the craze started.  Then and now I've come to the same conclusion: definitely one of the better YA fiction books out there.  Didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed D.J. MacHale's Pendragon Series, which was pretty much the only thing I read in middle school, but it still ranks up there above many other YA fiction novels I've read, such as "Shipbreaker" and "Incarceron."  I just finished my second read today, and I don't think I enjoyed it as much as I did the first.  There's a lot of things that could've done that, though.  It might just be that I've grown up some, become more experienced in literature, and so it takes more to impress me.  Or it could just be that I still somewhat remembered what happened so I was never really worried about any of the characters.  I probably shot myself in the foot too, so to speak, having read an astounding King novel before I picked up "The Hunger Games."  There's no telling, really, but I definitely enjoyed it more when I read it a few years ago when it first came out.  The writing isn't anything remarkable.  It's simple, easily understood, and concise, which is completely fine, I just think the writer could have done a little more, I guess.  The one thing that bothered me most is, and this is just my opinion, the lack of emotional depth to the characters.  Katniss seems almost completely numb to killing other children in the Games.  She is responsible for the death of a few tributes, such as the one taken by the tracker jackers and, inadvertantly, the deaths of Foxface and the boy from District 3, but the boy from District 1, her first direct kill, has almost no effect on here.  Where is the lament for taking another's life?  I like knowing the characters I'm reading about have a conscience, like (and this might just be my inner Wheel of Time fanboy coming out) Rand al'Thor in Jordan's Wheel of Time series, who, several volumes later, is still weeping over his first kill, and even commits to memory all of the names and faces of the deaths he's caused.  Yet Katniss feels no remorse for the boy, doesn't cry once for him--not that I recall, at least.  I can understand her not feeling bad about kiling Cato--that was an act of mercy, not malice--but it annoys me that Katniss doesn't grieve for the atrocities she was forced to commit.  Maybe the author does it intentionally to show how the Capitol has numbed the public to such things with the Hunger Games and the difficult lifestyles those in the Districts are forced to live.  But, since Katniss ends up inciting the rebellion against the Capitol, it would make since that she hadn't been numbed by the Games yet; she should fight against what the Capitol and the Games stand for in all ways, not let herself be broken down by it.  I read this book without feeling any sort of emotion, which isn't good.  I like crying over the agonies of the characters, like I did when reading "Pet Sematary."  This incited almost no emotion in me.  In short, this novel, though, in my humble opinion, somewhat overrated, is good in that it delivers an original and quite enjoyable story.  And, thank the lord, it seems to have put Twilight off the map (I'm not just hating on the Twilight series for kicks and giggles; I actually really enjoyed "Twilight", but the other books in the series were dreadful).  This book also gets props for not taking 800+ pages to tell a good story; having read only thick fantasy tomes for the past year, it was good for me to experience a simple, clear, 300+ page story.  I'll be giving the next books in the series a read too, which shouldn't take too long, considering these are quick reads.  Good YA fiction--but not that best, in my opinion.  Not a bad book for teens or adults.
I rejected every invitation to read this book since it was compared to the much overhyped Twilight series. But I'm so glad I caved, because I was up till stupid o' clock for 3 nights just trying to finish the whole trilogy - I seriously couldn't put it down!  Suzanne Collins imagination is genius - the plot was properly thought-out and intricate, the writing style was straightforward but very descriptive allowing each scene to be crisp in one's mind. It's been 7 years since I was a teen, but perhaps everyone above 20 who loves this book is just simple-minded since most negative critics claim only young adults are supposed to find it enjoyable. Well, I very much liked its directness and the fact that it was not loaded with excessive and unnecessary literary fluff...therefore leaving more room for the actual storyline to be the focus.  My greatest fear was that it would be too graphic with kids killing kids, and I for one don't do well with gruesome. But Collins did well by reducing the goriness of almost all the deaths, and also by not letting us get too attached to the rest of the tributes (well, except Rue); which somehow made the deaths a lot more tolerable.  One bone I do have to pick is why Collins made Katniss's character so unlikeable. I wanted to like her, not only because she was the main character but she was also a martyr; and that was the right thing to do. But boy, did I struggle! Why did she have to be so bland, and stoic? It seemed to me like the author herself was confused about how to portray Katniss to the readers. Was she a hero? If yes, why was she was constantly in self-defense mode? Was she a sweetheart? No, not with that lack of emotion. Heck! Even drunk Haymitch had a little more personality. Perhaps there is a reason for this that would be revealed in the next 2 parts of the series. I am optimistic, so I will hold my breath.  Overall, I think it was a captivating book, almost impossible not to feel like you were right there in the arena.
There is something infectious about the short, declaratory sentences that open the Hunger Games.  Perhaps it is the indication made so early on and so tacitly that Panem is not a place for deep reflection, a land where long-winded soliloquies are wholly inapproriate and out of place.  Whatever the attraction, this is one of those rare books that snags you at the beginning and doesn't let go until the very end.  It may be impossible to say anything different from what hundreds have already said.  Quite simply put, this is a great book and deserves to be read.  The author, Suzanne Collins, does a phenomenal job in crafting a world that is at once engaging, brutal, and terrifyingly possible.  It isn't that the book is so fresh and original that one cannot help but be spellbound, indeed much of what the Hunger Games brings to the table can be found, bit by bit, in other literary works or in films.  That these various elements don't feel trite, however, is a great credit to how wonderfully put together they are.  If the narrative is interesting, I don't particularly care that there may be another book that is somewhat like this one, the book stands on its own two feet and in my estimation is more than original and creative enough.  Arguably one of the author's best decisions was to maintain a fairly rapid pace throughout the novel which kept moments or bits of plot from becoming old too quickly with perhaps a few stumbles here and there (the part where Katniss and Peeta are sitting in a cave comes to mind).  Katniss is a good main character and I found it hard not to like her as the protagonist, though at times she seems a little dense which is at odds with 98% of what the book reveals about her.  She's a smart and savvy hunter and can discern the intent behind a sponsor's gift but can't figure out that Peeta isn't lying about his feelings for her.  It makes no sense and is perhaps the only example where the author missed a great opportunity to make her, and that part of the narrative, more three-dimensional and gripping.  Of course, the book is "brutal" insofar as it goes.  I didn't find it to be overly graphic and unlike some others I don't believe in the slightest that the book glorifies or romanticizes violence as there are several instances where characters decry what's going on and express indignation about what they're being forced to do.  The thing to villify is not the PG-13 violence, but the hypothetical governmental forces that not only allow the killing, but compel it to happen.  Those who would see in the book an endorsement of meaningless violence are those that I don't think have really read the book.  You won't receive anything on the order of Golding's Lord of the Flies, but it will force you to ask a meaningful question here and there.  While the book purports to explore the effects of war and violence on those coming of age, it seems that the planned trilogy took precedence and so, maybe, that exploration will be truly started with the second book which might be appropriate since the first one needed to introduce the world and, as I said, it isn't yet one that invites much reflection or philosophizing.  Overall, The Hunger Games is a dynamic book that, with a few notable missteps, does a great job in whisking the reader away.  It can be forgiven for being somewhat derivative, if you choose to look at it that way, but it stands as an excellent achievement.  It might not be a true classic but it does leave you hungry for more.
Hunger Games Review  After the reading the first installment of the hunger games, I find myself having an insatiable appetite for more.  An absolutely wonderful read, the first installment in the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins follows two protagonists, a girl named Katniss, and a boy named Peeta on a remarkable journey. Set in a futuristic world where the North America as we know it no longer exists, Katniss and Peeta are chosen from their impoverished district, district twelve, to compete in the Panem (name of the new country) "Hunger Games". These games pit the two against not only each other, but 21 other participants from the other districts in Panem (12 total).  What Collins does well is establishing the bond between Katniss, Peeta, and their hometown of district 12. The book is a whirlwind of action and revelation. As both protagonists learn more of their abilities and potential in the hunger games, they also begin to reveal more about themselves to each other. A special relationship forms between Peeta and Katniss that plays a pivotal throughout the hunger games, at times pitting them against each other, while other times, making each other their only hope for survival.  The Hunger Games takes a daring twist halfway through the book, and to share it would only ruin it for you, but rest assured it will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole book. Collins truly has mastered the craft of keeping the reader guessing, and flipping the pages wanting more. The story is a very simple one of survival and spirit, but the characters and scenarios that arise give it a unique and memorable touch. The Hunger Games is a book that leaves you hungry for more, and thankfully there are two more installments in the trilogy to enjoy.  Regardless of what kind of book you like to read, the hunger games has a story and message universal to all. It will keep you flipping the pages until your eyes threaten to shut down, and even then you will them to stay open just a little longer. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody, and plan on picking up a copy of the sequel very soon. So happy reading! And may the odds be ever in your favor.
"The Hunger Games" is simply incredible. Good luck putting this book down after the first chapter! Suzanne Collins made me feel as if I were running through the arena with Katniss. Katniss Everdeen is a role model for all young girls. She is fearlessly passionate for her sister Prim, incredibly smart, and not afraid of heart break. Katriss is beyond her years when it comes to intelligence. Growing up in the poorest area of Panem, district 12, she learns to provide for her family. Panem is the remains of what used be North America. The 13 districts declared war on the controlling government, the Capitol. The Capitol not only won the war, but they destroyed district 13 to show the 12 remaining districts they meant business. They also had to agree on terms to provide one girl and one boy from each district to fight to the death on television, which they call the celebration of "Hunger Games". On the day of the reaping, which is when the boy and girl from each district are randomly chosen to fight in the Hunger Games, Katniss's younger sister, Prim, is picked. Prim is horrified knowing that she won't stand a chance against the 24 trained tributes. So being the courageous sister that she is, Katniss volunteers for Prim. And the heart- racing, breathtaking, incredible adventure begins. After Katniss is trained for a week, she is propelled into the arena with her other tribune, Peeta, for the 74th Hunger Games. Every twist, every turn in this book made my jaw drop and thirst for more. Thank heavens there is a sequel to this book or I would be heart broken. I rate this book 5 stars for making me think with a new perspective and begging for book two. I truly encourage you to read "The Hunger Games" because it is an amazing read and this book will go to infinity and beyond.
I am not one to hop on the bandwagon of popular fiction, but my friend Miranda said that I HAVE to listen to this audiobook!  I have to admit that I didn't really know anything about this book when I checked it out at the library, so it turned into a pleasant surprise.  Collins immerses us into a dystopian society that was formerly North America, but is now known as Panem.  The time of the annual Hunger Games is approaching as everyone prepares to attend the Reaping.  All citizens are required to attend the Reaping, where they will choose each Districts representatives that will participate in the games.  As you can tell from the summary above, young Prim is selected from her District, but that is when Katniss comes forward to take her place in the games.  It takes a courageous girl to step forward knowing that it is very possible she will be murdered because of her decision.  A boy and girl from each District will be chosen to participate, and the games will not be over until there is only one child standing.  When the games actually begin, I think I turned into a nervous wreck as I listened to this audio.  It was very intense as these young people are forced to murder in order to stay alive.  We see how Katniss herself deals with these conflicting feelings that arise as she fights for her own survival.  I am not going to tell you any more about this book, except that it was amazing!  I know that this book is considered a young adult novel, but obviously readers of all ages have found enjoyment from it.  With themes of survival, honor, trust, and family, there really is something that will appeal to just about everyone.  I don't hesitate in recommending this novel to just about anyone I know.
The Hunger Games~   This book was one of the best books I've read. Not only did the author create such a vivid image in your head when you read it, but also the story line kept you on the edge of your seat. The setting takes place years into the future into a new country known as Panem. This new country rose from the ashes of North America after it failed. In Panem, there are 13 districts and one Capitol. Each of the districts specializes in a certain area. While one district might supply weapons another supplies coal. One year though, district 13 decides to start a rebellion against the Capitol because they no longer want to supply them and be under their control. This caused the Capitol to destroy the 13th capitol and kill everybody remaining. The Capitol decided to make more laws and become extra strict. They wanted to make sure no one ever forgot what happened and the power they have over them all, thus creating the Hunger Games.   Every year and once a year, each district must pick two tributes, one boy and one girl, from a glass bowl. These 2 tributes are then shipped off to the Capitol for training. Here they meet the other 22 tributes. Soon after their tanning they are taken to the arena, the battlefield for the games. While in this arena the tributes are forced to kill each other until only one is remaining while every citizen is forced to watch every brutal second of the games. The last tribute remaining will then go home and receive riches for the rest of their life.   Meet Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old teenager from the poorest district, District 12. At a young age she lost her father and was forced to support her mother and her little sister Prim. To do this every morning she leaves early to go hunt in the woods with her best friend Gale. Although hunting is illegal, they never get in trouble because everybody could use a little food.   One the day of the drawing for tributes, Prim is chosen. Katniss leaps forward to volunteer to take her little sisters place. Once she is up on stage the boy tribute is chosen. The boy picked is Peeta Mellark. He is also a 16-year-old teenager. Katniss and Peeta know each other but aren't exactly friends. Peeta was the one who got Katniss to start hunting again and saved her family from starvation.   When the games began Peeta told all of Panem that he was in love with Katniss. This was supposed to be only apart of the show, but he was actually telling the truth. At the beginning of the games, while in the arena, Peeta joins forces with the Careers (the rich kids from the upper districts who have trained their whole life for the Hunger Games, to them it's a honor) and helps them hunt down Katniss. This ends up being a lie to keep them away from her. Although he knows he has to die to keep her alive, he is willing to keep her safe. This is the problem, both Katniss and Peeta want to keep each other alive but to do that one of them must die.   Then there was a rule change. During this rule change, two tributes can win if they are from the same district. This sends Katniss into a frenzy to find Peeta, who has been seriously injured. Once she finds him she learns that Cato, their many enemy and the one with the best chance of winning, sliced open Peeta's leg. Together they take shelter and Katniss nurses Peeta back to health.    Soon there was only three left, Katniss, Peeta and Cato. Though they were spread apart, so, soon the gamemakers (ones who control everything that happens in the arena) send mutant mutts to chase them to the middle of the arena. This is where it all goes down.   Once all three find each other in the middle, Cato puts Peeta into a headlock. He tells Katniss to go ahead and shoot him with her arrows because all it will do is send him and Peeta to their death. Being a smart young girl and an expert with bows and arrows, she shoots Cato in the hand causing him to let go of Peeta and fall to the mutts to die.    Once Cato was killed, Katniss and Peeta think they have won. That is until the previous rule change had been revised, meaning only one could win. Katniss wasn't going to accept this. So she pulled out the nightlock berries (These berries are extremely deadly if you take one tiny bite, you will die instantly from the poison) and hands some to Peeta. They counted to three and shoved the berries into their mouths. That's when they are told they have won. Each spit out the berries and is lifted into the hovercraft waiting to take them back to the Capitol. They are finally safe and can both go back home and live peacefully with their families.... Or so they think. At home trouble is waiting for them, why? Because they outsmarted the Capitol. And nobody outsmarts the Capitol and gets away with it.
The Hunger Games is a very thrilling romance novel for people of all ages. This book starts a romance like no other when Katniss Everdeen and Petta Mellark are forced to come together and a battle for their district and their own life. Katniss never wanted anything to do with Peeta, all she wanted to do was take care of her family and hunt with her best friend Gale. Due to the harsh ruling of the country Panem, every year there have a huge televised event. It is called the hunger games. This event was created for a very disturbing reason. Due to the harsh ruling of Panem district 13 tried to overthrow the government. Due to their failure the whole district was blown to pieces. These games were created to remind the citizens of Panem to not try to overthrow them. In the games 24 competitors have to fight and kill each other until the last one is standing. Shockingly on the day of the reaping, out of thousands of little children Katniss's younger sister Prim gets chosen to be the female tribute from her district, district 12. Sadly the ages to be chosen for this event are 12-18 and Prim gets chosen on her first year. Katniss couldn't stand to see Prim go so she had to come up with a solution and fast! Katniss volunteered to take her place. Prim was so upset and had to be pried off of her by Gale.    Due to this, now Katniss and other district 12 tribute Peeta Mellark head into the capitol for a life or death battle. They have to fight against 22 other tributes that have lots of strengths and they trained for this event there whole life.

Don't forget, May the odds be ever in your favor!  Created by: Noah Stokes
Have you ever really looked at an animal in a cage? Have you ever wondered what they are thinking?  For the people in the Nation of Panem they know the feeling of entrapment.  Panem is a nation located in what used to be called North America. It is made up of twelve districts that all surround their shining capital of corrupt power.  Each district is enslaved to do a certain task for the capitol providing the capital with supplies and power, while the people are left in severe poverty and treated like slaves. For Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen-year-old girl, life is not easy. She lives with her mother and little sister in district 12, the coal-mining district. Katniss is a strong and resourceful young woman who is brilliant with a bow and arrow and works outside the rules of the capital, as much as, she can get away with.  The capital is always looking for ways to show off their power and control over the people in the districts. Their greatest display of power takes place during their ultimate reality game show, the Hunger Games. The rules are simple, but the price is dire, they must fight to the death until only one remains. Each district is forced to relinquish one boy and one girl ranging from the ages of twelve to eighteen to participate in the game.  This large display from the capital, treated like entertainment, is beyond cruel and inhumane.  Forcing children to kill one another on TV, shows how unequivocally ice cold and appalling the capital is.  This book is not like any other novel out there right now; it is insightful and meaningful to the real world today.  It could be named my generations Fahrenheit 451 and 1984. Everyday our rights are changing and being more and more controlled by the people with power and money.  This book shows that idea in an accelerated way with a horrifying twist. However, some of the ideas are not that far fetched. Suzanne Collins had the concept for the book one night when she was flipping channels and was switching from reality TV shows and the news.  This book is a gripping and enticing read. You will not be able to put it down. So, make sure you have enough time to devote to reading and have the next book in the series on hand and ready in the wings.  Prepare yourself to follow Katniss on the twisty and horrific adventure of her lifetime.
Blake Bechard    Period 3    5/18/12    Wow, this book is amazing! when I read in class and at home I never wanted to put it down. I had to wait a while to start to read this book because my brother was in love with the book, and he was always reading it. Finally I was able to read it and it was awesome. It amazes me that they would put 12 year old kids fighting against 18 year old teenagers. I also saw the movie it was kind of disturbing in some parts like when I found out that the little girl Rue was killed, and all the other young boys and girls. The dramatic life-or-death plot is incredibly compelling to me. It is exciting and disturbing at the same time.    The setting was is in a post-apocalyptic North America and goes by the name Panem. In district 12 were Katniss, Prim, and their mother. They are very poor after Katnisses dad died in the mine. So katniss has to risk her life by going in to an unknown place where she catches food for her mother and Prim. She also has the help of her good friend Gale that always brings her fresh loaves of bread. Then they find out it is reaping day, which is the day when kids get chosen for fighting in the Hunger Games. When Katniss gets home Prim and her mother are there waiting for her. Just when they get there, they get scanned and then stand there waiting in groups to wait for Effie Trinket to start to call the names.    Just when Katniss thought her and her sister Prim were safe Effie Trinket called Primrose Everdeen. All of sudden Prims face was blood shoot and as white as a ghost. she was walking up to the stage when Katniss screamed, I volunteer. Effie Trinket said WOW! That is are first volunteer in district 12. Next name was called Peeta. To survive this game you have to have the heart to give to the audience and believe in yourself. You have to be careful who you trust. Her and Peeta show the crowd that they love each other. But only one person can win the game so Katniss had to be smart and use all of her brain to think of how to trust and how to play the game.
SUMMARY  In the ruins of what used to be America, post-apocalyptic Panam has emerged. To remind its people that going against the Capital as District 13 did, the remaining 12 Districts must have "volunteer" a boy and a girl tribute to play the Hunger Games. Only one will survive. Added to this sacrifice is the insult that everyone must watch the televised Games. As the residents of District 12 gather in the Town Square, Katniss Everdeen prays that her name is not called. It is not. The name is Primrose Everdeen. Making the ultimate sacrifice, Katniss volunteers to take her little sister's place as tribute. To her dismay, the boy tribute is called: Peeta Mellark. How is she to kill the boy who gave her the bread after her father was killed in a Mine explosion? She must, if she is to survive. She can't afford not to. Katniss can't trust her mother after she fell into an immobilizing depression. Prim doesn't have her cold and calculating temperament that is needed for hunting. Prim can't go under the fence into the woods of what was Appalachia. With out her, the remnant Everdeen family will starve. Let the Games begin. The Huntress becomes the hunted.  MY THOUGHTS  1.) Katniss is a wonderful character. She is a survivor. She had to become the head of her family at a very young age. It is no wonder that she seems cold at the beginning of novel. She found out that she can't trust anyone (with the exception of Gale) at the tender age of 11. She will never marry and sacrifice her children to the Hunger Games. She is wary of any kindness given to her. But she grows as demonstrated by her affection for Rue. My heart broke and tears ran down my cheek as Katniss sang the lullaby to the dying child and covered little Rue with flowers. The gift that Rue's district gave Katniss and Thresh's sparing of her life showed that character development. Her joy when it was announced that 2 tributes could survive if they were from the same district was genuine. She really did like Peeta and reflected a small amount of humanity that Peeta spoke of on the roof top in the Capitol. She did slightly disappoint me when she broke Peeta's heart at the end. My heart ached for him. I thought Collins would have let Katniss explore her warm feelings toward him. Remember the warmth and butterflies she had when Peeta kissed her the first time when he wasn't medicated or in pain? I enjoyed those scenes in the cave.  2.) I found it very interesting that the vanquished 13th District was the original 13 American Colonies where America declared her Independence from England to form a government of We the People. Panam's Capitol is in the Rockies, not Washington, D.C. and Panam's government is the opposite of the Founding Fathers: Totalitarianism. The tribute Games reminded me of an ultra-modern take on Shirley Jackson's THE LOTTERY.  3.) The writing is exquisite. Collins use of the 1st person from Katniss' POV worked and necessary. It is her story. The action is almost nonstop. The descriptive scenes at the Capital were amazing! I could see the "girl on fire" and her twirling in her gemstone gown and her amazement when Peeta declares he's been in love with her since they were five. I loved Rue, respected Thresh, hated the Careers and the Capitol. I loved Cinna, too. I can understand the appeal this novel has; it is amazing!!!!! I loved, loved it.
In a world where all 12 districts are ruled by the controlling and ever-oppressive government known as the Capitol, children are forced to fight to the death until one person remains in the annual Hunger Games for the amusement of the Capitol's citizens. Katniss Everdeen becomes the next female tribute from District 12 for the 74th annual Hunger Games when she volunteers to take the place of her younger sister, Prim. Afterward, she and her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, are whisked off to the Capitol, where they are primped and prepped for the televised appearances that precede the Game itself. All too soon, the two teens are thrust into the arena determined to make it back home to District 12 and the families that they left behind - all while the entire world watches their every move. The Hunger Games is a book that immediately grabs your interest and doesn't let go until the very last page. Readers will laugh, cry, and fight along with Katniss and Peeta as they attempt to show the Capitol that they are people, not merely pawns to be used in their Games for the sole entertainment of the privileged of Panem.  I started reading this book because of a good friend's persistent recommendation and I'd already been hearing about it because of the movie that comes out later this week. Regardless, I picked it up and I don't regret doing so for one second. I absolutely loved this book. From the plot to the characters, everything about The Hunger Games is incredibly brilliant. With this book, Suzanne Collins has managed to create a world filled with people and events that readers can easily relate to, fall in love with, and follow along throughout the entire story. That's what I loved about this book - the characters are so real that you feel like you are actually living out the story of The Hunger Games with them. I was hooked from the first few pages and literally could not put this book down - I even finished it in one day! If you like action, suspense, and an incredible storyline, then you should definitely pick up The Hunger Games. I promise you won't be sorry that you did. The Hunger Games will leave you wanting more - which is a good thing, since it's the first book in a trilogy.
A MINI-SPOILER review for I've-seen-the-movie-but-haven't-read-the-book types. I'll be writing this review in the hopes you'll give the book a chance. What you've seen on-screen hasn't touched the surface. Here I am simply juxtaposing the movie VS the book.  There are several movie fans out there who (like me) watched the movie first, and read the book soon after. Some of you have no intention on reading it because at this point (May 13th?) the trilogy may have been spoiled from you by others. It shouldn't deter you from reading such a masterpiece. The movie can stand alone by itself without reading the book. But just barely. The movie (while is does run 2 1/2 hours) simply doesn't have the time to explain what is going on. You'll spend too much time feeling clueless as to why X scene/character is significant. Simply put, it's too hard to get a feel of the characters, and understand their life experiences, and internal pain. You also forget to have sympathy for EVERY child involved in such a morbid scenario, and you may simply end up cheering for the underdogs. (A point that the movie completely undermines, and nearly misses it). The book is far more violent than the film.  Now onto why you should read the book.  First: Personality Development  It is an in-depth view about class war, abuse of power, and the will to live from the street-smart, hardened-heart of 16-year old Katniss Everdeen as the protagonist in first person narrative. The book digs deeper into her psyche. What you may see on-screen is a withdrawn character who has eerily calm demeanor, under the circumstances of her fate. In the book Katniss is is witty, sharp, and takes on the role of the paternal provider of her family. [MINI-SPOILER ALERT] A role that is necessary, but she inwardly resents. (Only her grieving widowed mother, and younger sister, Primrose remain after their father was killed in a mine explosion when she was 11).[END MINI-SPOILER] She knows they can't survive without her, so she sharpens her hunting skills to survive off the land. Coming from the lowest ranked and least desired district 12, The coal industry, she is no stranger to hard knocks. She is profoundly mature for her age, and is not the bleeding-heart type. She can't afford to be. You will also learn more about Peeta, her counterpart and his role. What you may not see in the movie is that he is dually charismatic and self-deprecating. What he lacks in strategy he greatly makes up for in charm.  As far as Gale is concerned there is less personality development than desired, but even less in the movie. He does show up more in Mockingjay. (The third installment). This early in the book, all we know is that she really opens up to Gale, her hunting partner and best friend. She clams up to everyone else, save Rue. Of all the main characters, Haymitch, Katniss' and Peeta's drunken mentor and previous winner from District 12 decades ago, is far more powerful and carries more weight as to why he's there. Effie Trinket, district twelve's Capitol representative and annual announcer for the games, is less two-dimensional than meets the eye. She does have compassion for her tributes, and even fears for them. She just insufferably communicates how she feels from a privileged point of view.  Second, after seeing the movie, it really helps to put a face to what you've already seen. What I've written may or may not change your mind, at the very least putting emotions into other characters in the arena will. You will hurt for all of them, which is the book's intention.  Get to know them. For a much better understanding. At this point, I am about 1/3 of the way through Mockingjay and will write reviews for all three books.
Can you summarize the plot?  This book is the first in the Hunger Games series, and it follows Katniss Everdeen on her journey to try to win the hunger games.  The hunger games is a contest held every year in which 2 people (a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18) is chosen to compete in a fight to the death for the entertainment of the rest of the Panem society.  That's as basic as I can put it.  What were your initial thoughts going into the book?  I was a little scared that I might hate it.  Despite having read many (many, many, many, many) amazing reviews on this book and truly wanting to see the film, I was scared the writing would be too dull or horrific to hold my attention.  I also have a penchant for good endings and well, with a summery like the one above, you know a lot of people are going to die and I wasn't sure if I would be pleased with that.  What were your initial thoughts after finishing the novel?  I was a bit speechless.  I loved it.  Honestly, I really do like reading a bit of gore, it just makes happy endings hard to come by.  I genuinely love Peeta (yeah, I am definitely team Peeta) and I wanted to see where their relationship went.  This book drew me in pretty quickly and it was hard to put down.  What did you like about this book?  I liked that it was written in first person because I really liked Katniss' no nonsense way of narrating.  I loved most of the characters ::coughs:: especially Peeta ::clears thoat:: The world it is set in is so different and excited and I just needed to know more and more about it.  I am a bit of an sucker for dystopian novels right now.  I also really loved the gore and the way Suzanne Collins didn't shy away from that or make it too easy on Katniss.  She gets serious injuries and has to really fight to stay alive.  What did you dislike about this book?  I didn't like the love triangle.  This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine because almost every YA novel right now has a love triangle and I hate it.  I hate it for several reasons, but one of the main ones is that it takes a male character (because it is always one girl between two guys) that I could adore and makes me dislike him for trying to break up the main love interest which I typically like.  It also makes the heroine seem...um...Bella-esque?  It gives them that quality that Bella Swan had where she feels ridiculously unattractive but every guy hits on her. Stupid, I guess would be the only word coming to mind that comes close.  If you have a better word, please comment and let me know.  Regardless, Katniss is anything but stupid so I hate that she was given that quality.  Who was your favorite character?  Oooo...hard one....::thinks:: oh yeah, PEETA! I also really love Caesar Flickerman.  Does it have a love triangle?  ...whoops, please refer to the "What do you dislike about this book" question.  Does it have a cliffhanger ending?  Yes, but not a massive one.  It is one of those small cliffhangers you can deal with.  Closing thoughts?  Just one: I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE! March 23 please get here faster!
About the Book:  In a dystopian society, the Capital controls the districts around it by forcing strict rules upon them such as no hunting, no weapons, and restrictions on what sort of jobs they can have. However, the worst thing the districts are forced into is something called the Hunger Games. In these games, a boy and a girl from each district are chosen to participate and then thrown into an arena until only one is left alive. It is in these games that Katniss finds herself, and she is doing whatever it takes to survive.  Review:  First off, I love the fact that Suzanne Collins does not shy away from heavy issues and violence even though this is a young adult series. I love the fact that she believes that even teenagers can handle such issues (at least in text). With that being said, time to turn my thoughts to other aspects of this book.  I have to admit that this was a page turner, even though it was fairly obvious what was going to happen at the end of this book. The question was how. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to see how Katniss got out of each scenario. I have to say that some of my favourite scenes took place in the Capitol. Yes, the actual Hunger Games were quite entertaining with its weapons and survival, but the Capitol is just as harsh. Just in a different sense. In the Capitol, we get to see the tributes battle the press and learn how to be a good celebrity so that they can obtain sponsors, which can help them better survive in the arena.  Besides the entertainment value, Collins does a fabulous job at poking fun at our current society (which I thought was a nice underlayer) such as all the fashion trends that can be so outrageous as to almost be grotesque. Then, of course, there are the Hunger Games that the Capitol people watch religiously like our own American Idol.  Collins also manages to create fascinating characters. Honestly, I cannot think of a single character I dislike. I may dislike that character as a person or be aggravated by some of their traits though. For example, I could not see myself getting along with Katniss, but she made an excellent character. Then again, Katniss isn't supposed to be liked by everyone. Some love her and other times she simple rubs people the wrong way, and that is how I felt about her throughout.  Not only does Collins create interesting characters but boy does she have a knack for getting images and emotions to stick in your head for days upon end. Don't worry. I don't plan on giving out spoilers, but I have to say one major part that is still with me is the climax of the actual Hunger Games with the mutts (genetically altered animals). There was definitely a creep factor when they came into play at the end.  To be honest, the only things I really disliked  was the present tense writing and the love triangle. I'm guessing the former is more of a personal choice, but I am sure plenty can agree with me that the love triangle is getting old. However, it was definitely a subplot and not the main focus so I did not feel like I was drowning in the trope.  So all together, I felt that this was an excellent read. It had an entertaining plot, well-rounded characters, and it did a fantastic job at integrating our current society in a heavy yet satirical way. Collins has a gift, and I would recommend this to many people. In fact, if you haven't read this, I suggest doing so (with the next two books on hand, because you will be wanting them).
Hunger Games   "Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor!"   The Hunger Games takes place in the nation of Panem, a place once known as North America. Katniss Everdeen, the main character, volunteers as tribute in the games for her 12 year old sister Primrose. The Hunger Games are a battle of 24 young tributes, 2 from each district, to fight to the death for a single victor. Peeta Mellark joins Katniss as the male tribute in the games, and soon after declares his love for her, creating yet another conflict. Now, she must choose between Peeta and her best friend Gale Hawthorne, causing a more relatable conflict.   This novel is full of action and intense situations that keep you turning the page. Although, the book is not too full of action, as to where it is hard to stay focused. It is a perfect balance of action and relationship conflicts. The likeableness of some characters depends on your personality. Gale is the tough, independent man who keeps his feelings for Katniss inside. Peeta on the other hand, is sweet and caring, and tells Katniss exactly how he feels. Katniss is the fearless girl caught in the middle, while trying to keep herself and Peeta alive. This novel shows a theme of the loss of childhood innocence in many cases. Primrose is forced to grow up too quickly in order to take care of her mother. Katniss is forced to keep herself alive and someone else alive, and Gale is forced off to work.   If you like action and suspense, this is definitely a book for you. I would also recommend it to anyone who is looking for a different type of relationship conflict, but who still enjoys a little romance. This is a novel that keeps most anyone entertained and interested. It is a fantastic read.
As many have said, I loved the premise of this book. Borrowing from Lord of the Flies, the book chronicles a young woman's experience as she is swept up into a cruel, gladiator-like battle royal between fellow teens from different districts. All of this occurs at the fancy of a ruthless, totalitarian regime that wants to punish the districts for staging a rebellion against their leadership many decades prior. This book is extremely engaging, but it is not without faults. Told in the first person, we end up gaining the protagonist's perspective fully but lose much of what goes on behind the scenes. This serves to propel the action forward---but ultimately fails to put those experiences into a higher context. Fact is, there is/was a lot going on behing the scenes. For example, I would have loved to get more of a sense of what was going through the Chief Gamemaker's mind. Also would have loved to know a little bit more about the Capitol.  Collins has a way with action sequences (some of which had me on the edge of my seat)--but makes little attempt to develop any of her characters beyond the superficial. I never found myself believing in the love triangle--in part because I never got to know Gale. A few more introspective moments involving Peeta might have also given me reason to care more about him as a charater. Rue also came and went without any significant character development. Having said this, I found this to be one of the more memorable books that I have read in some time. I riffled through it on a plane trip and felt the need to finish it as soon as I got a chance (which meant reading long into the night). That is the mark of a good book....but not a great one.---Just rue (no pun intended) the missed opportunities to slow the book down a little, and cater a little more to an older readership who seeks a little more than what was given.
Imagine if the TV show "Survivor" featured kids instead of adults, and rather than voting each other off the island, the competitors had to hunt down and kill one another. Amid the bloodshed, two of the teenage participants seem to fall in love.  Would that be compelling television, or what?  This, roughly, is the premise of "The Hunger Games" the Suzanne Collins novel that has proved wildly popular among teens and tweens.  As a 51-year-old dad, I realize I'm not in the target market for this book. But my daughter, 11, devoured the book, and with all the buzz about it, I figured I should check it out myself.  Mostly, I liked what I found. Collins has created an intriguing, if grim, futuristic world where a rich and powerful central government dominates the populace (hmmm, a political message here?), keeping most people impoverished and scrapping to survive.  The story centers on the annual Hunger Games in which children from age 12 to 18 are randomly picked from throughout the country of Panem to fight to the death.  The weeks-long, 24-hour TV event transfixes the nation, with each "district" cheering for their representatives and the well-off residents of The Capital betting on who will be the final survivor.  Our hero is Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl who is sent to represent "District 12" in the Hunger Games. It's nice to see a tween book with a female character who is as strong and smart as Katniss turns out to be. In this sort of book, it's natural to play along with action, wondering what move you'd make next in the battle for survival, so it's good to have a protagonist who is clever and (mostly) avoids doing dumb things.  Collins sprinkles the story high-tech twists and imaginative elements like "tracker jackers," genetically altered wasps that attack and torment the games participants.  As the story goes on, a love story develops between Katniss and fellow competitor Peeta. To me, this was the weakest element of the book, simply because it's fairly familiar and less inventive than the other parts.  I also was not thrilled with the ending, which basically leaves you hanging and waiting for the next book. Even when they are part of a series, I like books to have a solid ending.
Hunger Games: a novel of the future, in which children are pitted against children, for the amusement of the 1%. Surely civilization will never sink to such depths, but then, many people thought the Holocaust could never happen.  It seem to me the basic tenant of the book is that the masses, the 99%, provide entertainment for the remaining 1%. This may or may not be true. My personal feeling is that the 1% gives the 99% what they want (the NFL, NASCAR&lt; the NBA, etc). In return the 1% takes what they want (money , power, Wall Street, law firms, etc). So far, the trade seems to be working: the obscenely wealthy are getting more wealthy, and the NFL and NASCAR are more popular than ever. Thus, the story line, that children will be pitted against children, for the amusement of the 1%, seems to not stand up to comparison with observation.  This book is also,in conjunction with other books in the series, a movie. It's one of the most poplar movies ever made, if  the press notices are to be believed. People are flocking to it; screen are sold out. People like to see other people threatened with injury and death, and survive. Escapism; the good guys win or survive (in this case,a n girl and boy), while the bad guys (in this case some fat kids from the city) lose. These stories used to be called "man against the elements" or "Cowboy movies". Would we read the Odyssey if Jason had drowned somewhere? would "Shane" be as good a movie if Shane had been killed in that bar room shoot near the end? No to both questions. Unfortunately, the fact that people are streaming to this movie is a tacit admission that the tenet of the boo, is probably correct.  If you admit you're one of the 99% being controlled and manipulated by te 1%, see the movie, read the book.
I read this book after seeing the movie with my daughter, and I really enjoyed it.  I've read over some of the negative reviews and I do think there are some things we have to keep in mind while evaluating this work.  1.  This is a book written for teen agers.  Therefore, we shouldn't expect it to be extremely deep, nor should we expect the writing to be beautifully crafted fair.  Collins isn't going to be confused with Faulkner or Shakespeare.  But that's OK, because most of us hated reading those authors in Jr. High and High School.  Collins's book is designed to give that demographic something to read and enjoy, which is most important to getting someone hooked on reading.  2.  A lot of people are saying that this book is a rip off of Battle Royale.  I haven't read that book yet (I am not a large consumer of fiction).  I do have to point out that Battle Royale was not, I believe, written for the teenage demographic.  I'll also point out that just about everything has in fact been done before.  Stephen King in fact said that Battle Royale had a lot of similarities to Running Man.  OK, onto the review.  THere are probably going to be some spoilers here (although, if you are reading reviews on Amazon, you should probably expect to see a couple, so no use whining about them).  For a quick picture of what this book is, cross 1984 with Gladiator and Survivor.  Really, the 1984 themes just ran strongly through the book.  The book is a fast paced read, with quick sentences and a cliff hanger at the end of every chapter which makes you want to keep going.  THe imagery is really good as Collins takes the time to describe things in detail.  I won't do a synopsis of the story as you have probably already are aware of it (or can read Wikipedia).  I will just point out a few of the reoccuring themes of the book.  1.  Food.  Food is constantly talked about - every meal is described in detail.  Despite the obvious title reference, I think food is such an ever present force because it is used as a weapon against the people of the districts, but also it is the source of Katniss's power - had she not been a hunter, she never could have survived long enough in the games to have won.  She understood how to live in the wild without the help of others - the lack of this skill lead to the death of at least one of her opponents, and weakened several others.  2.  Selflessness and Selfishness.  Katniss was willing to sacrifice herself to save her sister - Peeta was willing to sacrifice himself ot save Katniss.  However, the were too selfish to sacrifice eachother, despite what it would mean going forward.  Also, Haymitch's constant drinking was a shield to protect him from getting to know people that he knew were ultimately going to die in the slaughter.  And, of course the people of the Capitol, with their obliviousness to the country at large and their shallow focus on trite things like fashion while the gross majority of the country was being systematically starved to death.  ALso, Rue's exposure of herself to Katniss was an unselfish act, as her strategy was all about avoiding being seen.  3.  Resources.  The arena really pits the "haves" versus the "have nots" - the disticts that prepare their tributes for the games versus those that do it unwillingly.  4.  The power of a narrative.  Both the Capitol and the DIstrict 12 team want to shape the correct narrative to survive.  The Capitol one of all consuming power that would be pointless to oppose, and the team one of love and commitment that would be overly cruel to destroy.  Lastly, you do have to suspend some disbelief while reading this.  A rudimentary understanding of supply chains and economics would certainly tell you that a contry like Panem could not really exist.  Almost all fiction requires a suspension of reality (that's why it is fiction after all).  Just sit back and enjoy it.  I'll close this long - and perhaps not very good - review by just saying, read the book.  The odds of you enjoying it are ever in your favor.
It's not that I fell victim to the hype; "The Hunger Games" was recommended by a coworker at least a couple of years back - the recent release of the film is what moved it up on my reading list. The story represents for me something of a parallel universe that takes Reality TV to the next level.  It reads like a fusion of sci-fi adventure and romance, neither genre alone is typically enough to draw much interest from me; but the subtext, as I read it, provided a much richer experience of the story.  I couldn't help thinking about the similarities between "The Games" and the Reality TV show, "Survivor".  Both are televised events featuring contestants (tributes) who compete for a prize (fame and fortune) by voting off all other competition (or killing them).  Through this lens, the story becomes a cautionary tale warning us of the dangers of a society desensitized to violence; where viewing the most atrocious scenes of human debasement becomes entertainment for the nation. Where the manipulation of human emotion - by The Gamemakers (entertainment industry) and tributes (the romance back-story of Katniss and Peeta or any number of "Survivor" contestants who've manipulated fellow players to stay in the game) - is commonplace; expected even and ultimately, if you're really good at it, rewarded with the prize. Today's prize is a million dollars and the potential to earn more if your celebrity status is sealed due to a particularly vile form of manipulation and cruelty.  Some years from now, the prize could be your life.  The potency of the former statement is magnified when I recall my feelings towards one of this season's "Survivor - One World" contestants. While I don't recall the guy's name; I clearly recall his persona and particular brand of cruelty. A young, privileged, southerner and - by all indications of how he played the game - well versed in the ways of subjugation and manipulation to get what he wants; to win. During a tribal counsel; he attacked a fellow contestant with the most despicable assaults to the other guy's profession (a comedian), economic status (underemployed, barely making it - could really use a million dollars!) and character (called him lazy, needing to get a "real job"). His tone was sharp, sassy even; condescending and belittling beyond the point of cruel and rife with racial stereotype. In the following episode, he fell ill with appendicitis. I relished in his pain; told myself I could care less if he died and in that moment realized the failure of my humanity.  In that moment, I was one of the people from the Capitol.  Both stories will forever be connected in my memory, the preferred being Collins' imagined portrayal of the ultimate survival game.  Her writing is accessible and efficient - perfect for a teen/young adult read - while well paced and sufficiently nuanced (there are elements of government control, genetic engineering and social repression here as well) for a broader audience.  Although I don't plan to watch another episode of "Survivor", I'm sure to read the next installments of Collins' trilogy; imagined, fictional cruelty is much more entertaining than the real life version. A Recommended read, Enjoy!
Hunger Games started out with an amazing amount of promise. I'll even go so far as to call the first half of the book a classic. It's semi-futuristic, dystopian vibe was on par with that of 1984. Not only that, but the pervading sense of helplessness and hopelessness sitting juxtapose to such a dark and gritty event as the Hunger Games elevated it to be the most refreshing and thought-provoking novels I've read in over a decade.  That promise, though, was quickly squandered. The climax of the book happened merely halfway through with the action and intensity reaching its peak at the start of the games. What followed was a slow, dreary walk in the woods occasionally punctuated by a brief and trivial encounter with other tributes. Not to mention her decision to succumb to the tastes of love-starved high school girls and tweens alike and force a love story that was best left omitted.  What was worst, though, the thing that I felt best illustrated the incredible promise was the ending, an ending which addressed the complex, intriguing and ultimately heartbreaking ethical dilemmas with nauseating cliche's and cheap plot devices. In the end, her book failed to conclude these ethical dilemmas that made Hunger Games such an incredible book in the first place. Want my ending? Here it is.  Following the death of Kato and the rise of the artificial sun, Katniss and Peeta have won. But no, the announcer has just proclaimed that he was, in fact, kidding about kidding and they'd have to kill each other. With the hopelessness of the situation put in full perspective as well as their depressing helplessness against the tyranny of the capitol, Peeta expresses one more time the desire that he's communicated to KAtniss throughout the story. "I wan't them to know that they don't own me".  With that, Peeta climbs to his feet, takes his knife, looks defiantly into the cameras and slits his own throat. That incites rebellion and along come the sequels. The end.
In a distant future, after war has destroyed the world as we know it today, what was formerly known as North America is now Panem. Panem is made up of 12 districts ruled under a totalitarian authority. Katniss Everdeen is our heroine, who lives with her mother and younger sister in the rustic District 12. In this future world, the authority holds what are known as the Hunger Games each year, where two youths from each district are picked at random to compete to the death. Sounds brutal, but this is how the government reminds the population that they still have control.  Author Suzanne Collins has created a delightful futuristic world with Panem. We have several diverse districts; some having little to no technology, while others are overwhelmed with sophistication and wacky clothes to match. When Katniss ends up being a player in the games, her journey in preparation for the games is one full of colorful characters, bizarre foods, and lots of unique sight seeing. While some areas described give us the notion that the future world is a desolate and miserable wasteland, those Katniss visits throughout the games show us that we've also made quite a few interesting advancements to say the least.  The book really kicks into high gear when the games begin. There is not a dull or boring moment once things get going. At the beginning of the book I found myself not liking Katniss; I felt she was, well, a bit of a bitch for lack of a better term. But as the games progress, they cause a bit of self-discovery for her and as the reader we really begin to cheer for her. The other characters we meet are also likable and the enemies in the games are as gruesome as you can imagine.  Collins' writing style is just the way I like it: short and to the point while also adding that level of sophistication that tells you you're not reading a kid's book, but also doesn't show off like a thesaurus was constantly on stand-by. The detail given allows us to visualize first hand the manufactured and controlled battlegrounds during the games and gives us perfect images of devices and objects that have not yet come to existence.  The book is geared towards younger readers, but older readers should not let this deter them from picking it up. In fact, it's tough to tell what age is actually appropriate for this book. With the entire concept of the book being based around violence, it's definitely a young adult read, but the themes are socially relevant and would appeal to many adults as well. If you're looking for something with high action, political turmoil, a touch of sci-fi, and even a slight romance angle, The Hunger Games will not disappoint.  The book is the first of a trilogy which is also currently being developed as a film series at the time of this review. It will certainly be interesting to see how the films play out, as with the many non-existent items and all. The second and third books have since been released, Catching Fire and Mockingjay, which have been getting good reviews as well. With the gaining popularity and upcoming films, it will not surprise me that more will be heard about the series, and Collins will be much deserving of her accolades for crafting such an exciting modern adventure.

I hate using clichéd terms.  I very much want to find something more imaginative sounding than "gripping" or "thrilling" or even "compelling", but either my brain isn't working properly (highly likely) or those words genuinely do it justice.  I've had trouble putting this book down, and in fact, am probably at least 1/3 of the way through the second book of the trilogy.  This book was also my first ebook experience, having read it on my kindle.  But lets get back to the book.  The Hunger Games takes place in what remains of North America, now called Panem.  Panem is divided up into the Capitol and 13 Districts.  There was an uprising in the Districts about 74 years earlier that was put down by the Capitol.  In the process of this, District 13 was completely annihilated and the rest of the Districts left to eke out their lives in service to the Capitol, whilst annually supplying a lottery-chosen boy and girl between 12 and 18 years of age to take part in the Hunger Games. These Games are required viewing by all and are designed to remind the greater population that they are subject to the Capitol, with the victor being the last "tribute" left alive.  It's a fight to the death.  The main character Katniss finds herself thrust into the Games after she volunteers to take the place of her 12 year old sister Primrose as the District 12 tribute.  And so the Games begin.  The Hunger Games presents such a bleak picture of life in Panem.  I found myself hoping from the start that they would rise up and overthrow the Capitol.  So many people in the Districts are left to starve to death under the horribly sadistic government, that just surviving ordinary life is no mean feat.  The story is told in first person present tense, which took me a little getting used to, having never read a book in this tense before.  I think it adds to the pacing of the book though.  Collins apparently came up with the premise of the book while watching the television one night and channel surfing between reality shows where young people were competing for money and stories of actual war, where young people were fighting each other to the death.  Whilst it is set in a very bleak world, I really enjoyed this book.  In fact, I found myself getting quite emotionally invested in it and feeling a genuinely concerned about whether I could handle the stress of the story when reading the second book. That's got to be saying something about the skill of the writer, if you find yourself that involved in their literary world!  I  give it an 8 out of 10.  Review first appearing at [...]
My 13 year old daughter tried to get it at the library but there was a waiting list and of course she couldn't wait! So I spent $5 for the kindle version. She seemed thrilled by it and I've heard older people seemed enthralled by this novel and want to continue through the other 2 episodes which make up a trilogy.  I was intrigued by the writing style, the fluidity of the story line which opens with the heroine Katnis getting out of bed in the morning and wishing she could kill her sister's beloved cat. Right there you get a jolt. This 16 year old girl has a vicious streak. She does love her sister however. She has definite strong character traits.  Katnis has a daily mission - to feed her sister and mother by hunting with a male friend in the illegal territory of woods. She is a true shot with her bow and arrow. She's joined with a boy just slightly older than herself whom, she infers is just a friend. No love interest. They are both out to survive and keep their families from starving.  The main plot is the ghastly program run by the Capital, an iron fisted government that demands two young people, one male, one female, between 12-18 from each of the 12 "districts" to come together into an "Arena" of weird changeability, woods, mountain, lake, dangerous unreal wildlife. The object is to survive not only this environment, but to kill everyone else until one survives - the glorified Victor.  Katnis's 12 year old sister, Prim, has her name drawn. Katnis immediately volunteers herself as substitute. This is a very emotional, telling moment - this heroine has strong feelings, both of love and ferocious determination.  Why do I think this story is for female juveniles? - First of course there's teenage Katnis, who is heroine all the way through. Then, during the glorified preparations with much ceremony and fanfare before the "Games" begin, there is plenty of costume and makeup description most girls enjoy. I don't think a boy would be so enthralled by this. She is attended by two skilled body beauticians and one very creative costume designer. Her male counterpart also gets a makeover, but that's a minor supplement. A boy might like the episode about weapons training.  I'm not going to go into detail about the Game itself. It's the super-adventure part. Really really out of this world in scary detail and weird happenings, and if you like this, then the book is for you!  Then, finally, there's a Love bit - can't have a juvenile girl's story without Romance! Her male companion, Peter, claims to be in love with her right in the Game's outset, much to the joy of the Capital. They defend each other through it all. A big thing is made of this also by the blood thirsty Capital as entertainment. All is televised to the entire country. The people have to watch. Whether they approve, is not allowed. I'm sure they watch with horror and apprehension. After all - their children are being forced to fight to the death, with only one survivor.
This book is a fast read.  It took me 5-6 days to read on my Kindle Fire, which is the fastest I've read any book.  That's how interesting it is.  But, I do see some issues that I think parents should know about before letting their kids read this story.  Before I start on that, I'm an aspiring writer, and for the most part, don't believe in censorship.  But I do believe in self-censorship, within reason.  The author has a unique voice, and writes well (this being the first book I've read from Suzanne Collins, I've read plenty of other authors).  There's no denying she has talent.  However, given this particular story is marketed toward 12 year olds and up (7th grade +), I think certain scenes should have been omitted as inappropriate.  For example, when the protagonist Katniss Everdeen (a 16 year old girl) reaches the Capitol, she is made to strip completely naked in front of two stylist assistants, before Cinna comes to look her over for styling.  Cinna is an of-age male stylist who lives in the Capitol, and requested the, "Tributes," as they're called, from District Twelve.  At this point, Katniss is still completely naked, and stripped of excess body hair.  She doesn't cover herself up in front of him, and is not sure if she should.  For me, this is a main sticking point.  As prudish as it may seem, I don't think children should be made to stand naked in front of strangers.  Even in a work of fiction.  Life imitates art, exaggerates life.  A story geared essentially for teens may give an impression - regardless how subtle - that this kind of thing is okay to do.  I was talking to a friend of mine, who's main concern was not this, but the amount of violence shown throughout this story.  I agree with her that this is excessive.  While death and murder is a part of the real world, society struggles to keep it to a minimum, if not eradicate it altogether.  Showing how 12 - 17 year olds are forced to kill or be killed, for the entertainment of its rulers - and a country which is forced to watch - is something to be questioned.  Yes, there are horrors in this story.  I'm not one who is shuns horror stories, as I grew up on stories by Stephen King and Dean R. Koontz.  I've watched the Friday the 13th movies, and other similar movies and shows growing up.  I say this here to tell you that I am not opposed to horror stories.  But this is a different type of horror, and I write this review as an adult.  One who still reads Stephen King and Dean Koontz, as well as various authors (both male &amp; female) across this and similar genres.  Would I recommend this story?  To most adults, probably.  To anyone under 18 years old, probably not.  If you pre-read your children's books, consider what I've written here in addition to pre-reading this one.  Ultimately, the choice is yours.
This is book 1 in the trilogy. Around when the movie came out a few of us at work decided that we really did have to read the trilogy, so one of us went and got the first book and I have just now ordered the rest of the books. I gave actually ordered all of them now. Just Friday was I able to get the first from my coworker, after two others. On to the review now.  The United States is now, made of up districts, each with their specialty and each controlled by rulers in the Capital. In order to remind the districts of the control they have each year the Capital draws the a name of one boy and girl from each of the districts and forces them into an arena for a fight to the death.  Katniss has supported her family since her Father died a few years ago. In order to do that she has learned to be mentally strong and to hunt or forage so she can keep food on the table. Now, she must use all of her knowledge to stay alive in the arena. In the arena is Peeta, also from District 12, like Katniss and they have a history together that neither of them can forget. But, are unsure on how to let that effect them in the games. Then there is other Tributes from the other Districts to deal with too, and though she is suppose to kill them and Katniess isn't sure how she feels about that.  As you can tell from the fact that I got the book on Friday and finished it today I couldn't put it down. It is a YA book and truthfully I am not sure what age it is for and am not really sure that it is something I would have been allowed to read as a youth. But, I think there are great themes in the plot that I hope parents would talk to their children about as they read it. There are themes that are just scratched here in the first book in the trilogy and I look forward to seeing how they are dealt with in the next book. Mostly the political stuff, it is presented but needs expanded on.  This book concentrates on the arena and what happens there with the characters developing who they are and making choices in how the arena effects them. Hard decisions are made by all of the characters and seeing how they deal with the decisions adds to the dimensions of the plot.  I would recommend this book to others, giving it 4 stars, but when it comes to YA, I would suggest the parents read it first and be prepared to talk about things especially if the kid is under 15.
Sports stores around Northern California are sold out of archery supplies. Store clerks said The Hunger Games were behind the surging enthusiasm for the sport. I had to find out why!  This young adult story's theme is that goodness can stand up to evil. You may not prevail but you can survive without stooping to the same level of savagery as your opponent.  Protagonist Katness Everdeen, a mid-teens female, is admirably developed as a character early in the story. Her family is poor; her father dead from a mine accident. She is smart, quiet yet assertive and courageous. She is a skilled archer and small game hunter willing to break the law by hunting and gathering in the off-limits forest to feed her mother and younger sister. Other characters are not so well developed. Those close to her who survive get more attention than those opposed who die in the Hunger Games. Even though this is unsatisfying to some readers it may be intentional on the author's part to avoid having to kill off characters with whom the target audience (young adult) has bonded.  The basic conflict is between a central government (the Capitol) and 12 provinces (the Districts) that lost a war with the Capitol. This too is not well developed. There is insufficient background given to explain their source of power other than references to various technologies they employ to catch you out if you are a "traitor." Their enforcers ("Peacekeepers") are corrupt. Peacekeepers prefer to turn a blind eye to the protagonist's illegal hunting in exchange for the opportunity to buy a squirrel or rabbit for their table. Seems food is scarce for everyone outside the Capitol.  From a technical point of view the book has quite a few literary flaws. Yet it is "a page turner" for those of us interested in entertainment. I like the personality conflicts and relationships in any story to be believable, even when a large stretch of imagination is required (e.g. Tolkein). Most of this book meets those criteria until you get close to the end, when some scary fantasy creatures inexplicably appear out of nowhere. Before that event everything that happens seems possible in a real world of the future.  I am torn between 3 and 4 stars for this book. In the end, because it was a good read and fun, I give it four.
The Hunger Games is a really captivating and intense book that catches the reader's attention from page 1 and has a great plot with really interesting characters. The story revolves a post-apocalyptic America and there are 12 Districts which ranks people in a class-type system. District 12 is the poor class and each District above ranks higher and higher. Protagonist Katniss Everdeen lives with her family in District 12 and hunts for food for her family with her friend Gale. Once a year, "The Hunger Games" are held throughout all 12 districts, and it involves picking 1 boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to fight each other to the death and specially designed arenas. When all of the youth gathers up to be chosen, Katniss's younger sister, Prim, is chosen and Katniss steps in and volunteers to take her place. The boy on her team, Peeta, had saved her family's life from starvation so she felt guilty that she would be fighting to kill someone that saved her life. One aspect that's really unique is that you feel like you're always in Katniss's head because she thinks a million questions at once and she thinks the way a true hero does. Before these Hunger Games take place, the 24 chosen ones have to go through interviews and training for the games, and everything is shot on TV for everybody to see; so families  of the chosen ones actually watch their children die. In the arena, Katniss is very different compared to the others. She makes friends with a few of the chosen people and receives lots of help like food and medicine from sponsors; that's very rare for people in such a low district. Katniss makes her closest relationship with Peeta, and they survive by faking a love relationship with the audience. Katniss sounds her age when she's going through with this, very confused if she actually likes him or not. The ending has an amazing climax, and I'm not going to spoil it. I highly recommend checking out this book, it'll be a really quick and fun read!
I saw (and liked, much more than I expected to) the movie before reading this, and I like the book just as much. I don't think I have a preference--though the book has all of the extra time and space to say more about Panem society, to let Katniss and Peeta and the other characters talk to each other more, to go harsher, more disgusting, and more complicated places than the movie went. (And it has the characters as they should be, free of whitewashing.) I feel like the film did a better job of making it clear that the Games succeeded or fell on the basis of their having that narrative structure, the final push to the one victor--the theme was there through the entire film, but felt pushed a bit into that final scene in the Arena in the book. But the book was clearer in its condemnation of what the Games do to people watching it, in the Capitol, how they remove people's actual empathy and leave them watching only edited caricatures, easy to relate to story-people they can feel safely removed from but still 'care' about. The book was also clearer on how confused Katniss was at the end. And I like that very much, letting characters be very confused about what they feel and why! Attraction feelings are confusing even in real life, with no death games in sight. (Another point in the movie's favor was the use of different perspectives it introduced, with the scenes with President Snow and Seneca, the scenes in District 11, etc. I liked those, though they fit a film structure better than a book structure. Really, the film and the novel work as a very nice pair, one Katniss-centric, one showing other viewpoints.)  Very, very, very easy to read. I'm a little irritated there's such a strong Dramatic Romantic Choice vibe (I'll be over here on Team Cinna, just to be contrary). The story and characters are strong enough I don't feel I need a DRC to interest me and carry me through to the third novel.
I saved a ton of money by buying this as an eBook for my lovely kindle. I breezed through it (like so many others have) in about a day. I'll admit, I wasn't too keen on reading it at first, as I am curmudgeonly and usually avoid anything too popular out of spite, but my sisters (both in their early twenties, for the record) insisted that I give it a try. I'm so glad I did!  This isn't a perfect novel, not by far, but it is just compelling enough to keep you going, just human enough to make you really care, and yes, just violent enough to entertain in the way that only such things can. I don't think the violence was too much, nor do I think it was gratuitous--at least for this first installment in the series. Be warned: there is enough of a cliff-hanger of an ending that you will really have to read the next two books.  "The Hunger Games" is very dark, thematically, but then it would be, wouldn't it? For the parents out there wondering if this book *promotes* child-on-child violence, I have to say: emphatically not. "Harry Potter" does that more than this book does, because unlike Harry, Katniss never sets out to deliberately humiliate anyone (but I digress! I loved the Harry Potter books, but for those of you looking for a benchmark, I do think HP is much softer on bullying behaviour than the Hunger Games books). Katniss is a fine heroine--a believable teenage girl, but not a stereotype.  So why not five stars? Well, while the story and characters were compelling enough to keep me going, the writing was a little lackluster at times and even though I liked Katniss, it could get a little frustrating being "stuck in her head," as the entire novel is written in first person present. Additionally, just because Katniss doesn't want to know to much about the other children in the story (for good reason, if you know anything about the basic plot), as I reader I would have liked to know a bit more!  Plus I really do think this book should have resolved in a way that left a better option for treating it as a stand-along novel. I know it's a trilogy, but as it is sold separately I would have preferred that it have enough of a resolution to be its own entity. Other opinions may differ.  If you would like to know more of my thoughts on the series as a whole (with spoilers, though!), I've been writing a series of blog posts on the books at [...]
(spoilers)  I have to give my appreciation to the author. It is hard to create a setting with so much potential and completely avoid any kind of drama or interesting development whatsoever. Another author would've had the characters sturggle with the moral mess that the Hunger Games are, would show the dispair and the terror of kids sent to a televised death.  But no. Instead, we got Twilight with a fun video-game like setting.  The "love story" had a lot of potential - the constant knowledge that the other might betray you any second, yet the desperation and the terror of the moment overwhelm you so much you throw yourself in any open arms, even if they might strangle you later... yes, I could see potential in that. Yet instead, we got that extremely convenient rule change, which took every bit of drama out of the relationship between Peeta and Katniss and made it boring.  Instead of a rough, messed up, and ultimately interesting to watch love story, we got a bitchy Katniss abusing poor Peeta's feelings so she could get some bread soup. Even that had the potential to become interesting, but the author decided to pull a Twilight instead and make Katniss completely undecided about whose arms she liked to cuddle in better. It would've been dozens of times more dramatic if, say, she knew from the beginning that she prefered Gale and she only acted like liking Peeta so as to help her win the game. Perhaps, by the end of the games, she realizes she isn't completely indifferent to Peeta. But no, instead we had to be reminded each time she seemed to go one way or another that she was undecided.  I kissed Peeta, BUT I KINDA LIKE GALE TOO. The tought of Gale makes me fuzzy, BUT PEETA GAVE ME BREAD 10 YEARS AGO. That was so sweet, BUT GALE HELPS ME HUNT. That gives my family food, BUT PEETA IS BLOND AND HAWT."  I felt like the author tried way too hard to make Katniss conflicted about her feelings, when she could've been way more subtle (and spare us from a couple dozen boring pages). Even Bella realized only in the 4th book that she loved Jake too. Until then, it was hinted at and shown that she wawsn't completely indifferent, but it wasn't outright stated until a few thousand pages later. Here, from the first two chapters we have the love triangle already set up and prepared to be overused to death and beyond by the author.  So, besides the love story, the book was good right? An arena where kids have to fight and kill each other... there must be a lot of drama, betrayal and hard choices, right? Right?  No, appearently. A good part of the characters are dealt with by other contestants in the Hunger Games. Whoever Katniss starts to feel sympathy for is conveniently killed by some bad guy, who then becomes an acceptable target to kill, which she promptly does.  First, I really don't understand why there had to be bad guys". At least four psychopaths and most of the other characters are made unlikable enough as to spare poor Katniss from any moral trauma when she murders them. Why were the carrers" all bad guys? Risking your life for the wellfare of your district and family seems rather heroic to me. But no, each career is made up to be as a snobby sadistic son of a lady dog who has no morals whatsoever, therefore making it completely morally acceptable for Katniss to massacre them.  Why did Peeta have to be a good guy all along" and not actually betray Katniss when he joined the Careers? Why didn't Katniss have to kill anyone she didn't have a personal thing against? Why didn't Rue betray Katniss? Why did Katniss befriend Rue in the first place? Why did Thresh, whom Katniss became sympathetic to, have to be conviniently killed by the bad guy? Why did we have that ridiculous rule change which took every tiny bit of drama and potential out of Peeta and Katniss' relationship? Why couldn't Katniss let Peeta die so she might win? Why (on EARTH) did Thresh let Katniss go? Basically, why did the author do anything humanly possible to take every single potentially interesting bit from the book out, just so her heroine remained morally as clean as a baby's ass?  The potential for drama was there and it was huge. We could have had Katniss constantly on the move, constantly alert, scared for her life, hunted by other scared children, suffering the psychological traumas of killing and being hunted, having to kill both friends and enemies, perhaps a part of her even resenting Prim for having gotten her there. But no, she was safe and sound in her trees, always having enough food, her morality protected from any dillema by (appearently) all the gods and men and always having an ally who adored her and who she could feel safe next to.  The equivalent of this book is having an helicopter and using it as an air-blower. So much potential, so little of it used...
I don't often see movies or read books due to media hype. After seeing and enjoying the movie adaptation of this story I rushed out and bought the book. Panem is the new incarnation of the United states that was obliterated during a violent civil war. In the dark days there were uprisings and rebellions that were eventually quashed by the powers that be in the Capitol. As punishment for these insurrections, THE HUNGER GAMES were established to show the districts just who was in control. Two adolescents were chosen in a lottery -one of each gender to participate in the games and fight their peers to the death in the arena. Catniss Everdeen takes the place of her younger sister whose name was pulled. Also chosen was Peeta Mellark.The two must train and learn to fight and survive and the last tribute standing is named the victor.  The book itself goes deeper into the background of the games and explores the ideas of the totalitarinism of Panem and how it's citizens are mere puppets in life and in the games.  Catniss is a rebellious character who doesn't want to but is forced to follow the rules. The games are televised so she cannot overtly pull a fast one and risk reprisals for her friends and family in district 12.  The story is well written. There are elements of suspense and plenty of action. Themes include compassion for others when self preservation is the norm. There is romance as manufactured by the game makers and Catniss and Peeta have to play the game to survive in the arena and the world at large. Any deviation is cause for treason and punishment. This book was a real page turner as it has some thing for every one. It is rated in the Young adult category but adults will enjoy the book as well. I highly recommend it and give the story five mocking jay pins.
I really liked it.  Having said that, I would like to point out how reluctant I was to read it. I felt the story was overplayed. When I first heard the plot, I immediately thought of Battle Royale as well as the story of the Minotaur. My best friend kept pressuring me to read it and I kind of wanted to see the movie, so I broke down and bought it.  It moves very quickly. I liked how it was set up and the progression of the plots and themes. At times, I would sigh because I wondered at the quality of the writing. However, you need to remember that this is written from the point of view of a 16 year old girl and realistically conveys this idea. It also is about a 7th or 8th grade reading level. It likely won't challenge the adult reader, but it does create a nice escape while you read. It took me a little less than a day to read and I would say I am a relatively slow reader.  I think there are characters that everyone can relate to. I liked Peeta the most. I felt he was the most relatable especially with how he is portrayed in the book when compared to the movie. I'm not saying they did a bad job in the film because they really didn't. Things in the books just made the basic framework of Peeta's character clear and it's just not possible to put everything in a movie. I can see many teenage girls relating to Katniss and her struggles to fit in, survive and figure out what she wants while fulfilling what she sees as her responsibility.  I do think this would be an appropriate read for a younger teen. I probably would say no younger than 10 although you know your children. It may be something you could read together and talk about injustices the government is committing. I'm not saying you should raise rebels or anything, but every child needs to learn at some point if or when they would need to stand up to an authority figure.
I decided to read THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy after seeing (and loving) the movie.  I thought the characters were fleshed out really well in the film and the quick pace of the plot moved the story along very quickly.  It made me want to know and learn more...right away.  I bought all three books and dove right in.  The first, THE HUNGER GAMES, is a combination of Lord of the Flies and the reality TV show Survivor.  Kids from a futuristic society are chosen from twelve "districts" to fight to the death in yearly games set up by the wealthy and privileged who live in the "Capitol."  It's purposely unclear when this futuristic society takes place, unlike the very specific Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell.  I was glad, though, that I saw the movie before reading the book.  It made the movie that much more thrilling, because I didn't know what was going to happen during the Games or where the story was going.  I truly was surprised...and amazed.  The book, however, answered some of my questions that came up during the movie.  It reveals a more insights into the Games, the Capitol, the world where Katniss and Peeta live, and the origin of some things in that world.  There were very little differences between the book and the movie, but I thought the movie did a better job of portraying the excitement and terror of the games.  And, visually, it was just stunning.  One thing I noticed in the book was that it was overly detailed with its descriptions of food, and sometimes that was a bit off-putting.  Obviously, I know why there were these inclusions (it's in the title!), but it seemed like Katniss was constantly counting up her food supply and describing each and every thing that she ate in too much detail.  For me, it made the story drag a little.  All in all, though, I loved the concept of THE HUNGER GAMES and the whole futuristic society that Suzanne Collins put together.  I'm looking forward to jumping right into the second book, Catching Fire.
"The Hunger Games" is meant for a young adult demographic.  There is no going around that fact.  As such, the character development and themes are going to be much different (e.g. a bit tamer, less confusing) than, say, from the pen of a Stephen King or some such author.  That being said, "Hunger Games" is easily good enough to captivate even adult readers, which is more than can be said for many (most?) young adult books these days.  For a basic plot summary, "Hunger Games" introduces the premise of a state-controlled society where, each year, a group of children are selected to fight to the death for the amusement of the Capitol.  This year, young Primrose Evergreen is selected to participate in the Games...but quickly volunteered for by sister Katniss.  A whiz with a bow/arrow and possessing the ability to live off the land, Katniss must outwit the 23 other "tributes" in order to survive.  Along the way, Katniss must deal with her emotions involving fellow tribute Peeta, a relationship steeped in lies, acting for the Capitol, &amp; an old debt that may need to be repaid.  In terms of character development and themes, I have read many books that easily surpass this one (again, though, due to its YA target audience).  The characters in this book are interesting in their own right, but they are very simple in terms of emotions and attitudes.  Perfect for youngsters; a bit lacking for adults.  What still makes this a fine read, however, is the fact that author Suzanne Collins keeps you guessing from chapter to chapter.  Because of the unpredictability of the Games, literally ANYTHING can (and does) happen over the course of the novel.  With the introduction of each new character/scenario, the reader is given a possible ending scenario...which is usually completed wiped out by the "big reveal" in the next chapter!  Simply put, it keeps you "on your toes" the whole way through.  Overall, "The Hunger Games" is an incredible work of literary fiction for what it portends to do.  It, like Harry Potter, got many young people reading books (which I will never argue is a bad thing) and spawned two sequels &amp; a major motion picture.  Does the overall experience live up to the incredible hype?  Not quite.  But "Hunger Games" is a very worthwhile read that will make you want to continue on to see what "the next step" is.
I was so convinced that I wouldn't enjoy this book that it sat on my e-reader for weeks until my daughter brought home a hard copy and literally had to twist my arm to read it. Sci-fi is not usually my favourite genre, and I can probably count on one hand the amount of futuristic novels I have truly enjoyed reading. But Suzanne Collins' "Hunger Games" totally proved all my prejudices wrong. The story was so well crafted and the characters so engaging that I was hooked from page 1, and had a massive late night read-a-thon until I had finished the whole book, as I could not put it down.  What I particularly liked about this book is that Collins has created a futuristic world which bears enough similarities to our own so that I could relate to the things she described without having to put in too much effort. The character Katniss tells about her world without offering too many tedious explanations that would have made the book a chore to read (like many other sci-fi novels) - instead, she takes her dysfunctional world for granted and accepts its injustices and hardships just as we get blind to the faults in our own backyard. This to me added to the feeling of reality to the story rather than trying to find explanations for the reasons why her world was the way it was, as seen through the eyes of a 16-year old girl.  To put it very simply, the story itself played out like a cross between Survivor meets Gladiator meets Big Brother, but with much more depth and action and of a much superior calibre. Who has not questioned our ability to watch horrible reality TV images 24/7 whilst eating our dinner? So it was no big stretch to imagine the people of Panem doing just that, on a much larger scale. I especially liked Katniss' and Peeta's ability to remain true to their own moral guidelines throughout the book without appearing to be sickening goodie-two-shoes, or without preaching about right and wrong - let the readers draw their own conclusions. I also liked that there were no defined villains in this story, rather victims of circumstance all trying to stay alive - this again made the story a lot more realistic and believable.  To cut a long review short, I loved this book. I can usually tell whether a book truly grabbed me from the feeling of unreality when a phone-call or a visitor interrupts the reading and you surface bleary eyed and disorientated, still under the spell of the imaginary world you have just inhabited. This was such a book, and I thoroughly enjoyed being a spectator in Katniss' world for a while. I am now looking forward to reading the second instalment!
"The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins is a science fiction novel based in the country of Panem, a post-apocalyptic America, which illustrates the internal and external struggles of the main character, Katniss Everdeen.  The plot surrounds The Hunger Games, in which in an effort  to show power, the Capitol forces citizens from twelve surrounding districts to send one boy and one girl, tributes as they are called,  to fight to their death for punishment of a rebellion that happened long ago.  Suzanne Collins utilizes numerous techniques throughout the novel, including an inspiring ability to engage the reader from one chapter to the next, the countless detail that does not seem relevant until the plot twists, and an elegant script that encompasses love, death, and everything in between.   Throughout the book, the author concludes chapters in a way that is so captivating that it makes it very difficult to put the book down.  Collins writes in an almost suspenseful way that leads to many questions and crucial ideas.  The first chapter ends with the reaping where the female tribute's name is pulled; "It's Primrose Everdeen" (p. 20).  It is difficult not to feel sorry for this twelve year old girl that will inevitably be killed if she is forced to participate. The difficulties Katniss has had to endure and the importance of protecting her younger sister Prim from anything that she can, is an important theme in the book.  This leaves the question as to how Katniss is going to protect Prim from the Hunger Games.   The intense details throughout the book make it feel very realistic, giving the feeling of actually being in the Arena with the tributes.  "The world has transformed to flame and smoke.  Burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet . . . the wall of fire must have an end" (pp. 13-14).  Many of the details describe a blooming love story in the midst of a barbaric scene that is outrageous and charming but also riveting.  Collin's ability to decipher where details are necessary makes the violent situations seem a little less threatening without losing the important concepts.   Just when this book seems to only be about the effects of war, rebellion and death, the love story between Katniss and her male counterpart Peeta, adds an innocent spin that is heart wrenching.  "This is the first kiss where I actually feel stirring inside my chest.  Warm and curious" (p. 298).  Whether the love is real or for the show, the connection between Katniss and Peeta cannot be dismissed.   Collin's portrayal of a strong and broken, but powerful girl keeps the book interesting from start to finish.  The suspenseful and captivating words keep the book engaging and very difficult to stop reading.  The descriptive story line makes it is easy to envision what the author is trying to portray without being over the top and gruesome.  Will the love between Katniss and Peeta blossom, or will the realities of life at home and the memories of the Hunger Games steer them apart?
The Hunger Games is in first person, present tense, and Collins masterfully pulled me into the story in such a way that I felt everything that Katniss Everdeen, the heroine, was going through.The "one-line synopsis" of this read seems to generally be something like "it's about modern-day child gladiators"...but in reality, it is much, much more.  Unlike what I halfway expected, the annual Hunger Games are not glamorized or applauded. Collins is actually out to make you loathe the Games and everything they represent. The story is really a vivid picture of history repeating itself. It's future America turned Ancient Rome, with some appalling modern twists; a scary look at the direction our world could be headed in left to human nature. It's a moving account of determination, grit, selflessness, survival, and loyalty, with some necessary graphic brutality thrown in. And yes, the violence is nothing less than disturbing in spots, so it's certainly not for everyone. If you're offended by or can't handle violence...don't read it.  Laden with conflicts of diverse natures, The Hunger Games kept me guessing and made me trulythink and process each new obstacle, both physical and mental. It was like I was on a roller coaster ride of intense emotions. The incredible depth of each well-developed character is half of what makes this novel great. I also appreciate that the book is completely void of anything religious, a neutrality I find to be rare in today's entertainment. If there were hints of religion, they'd likely be flawed, so better to omit them altogether.  That said, The Hunger Games contains tremendous moral values, if you're tuned in for them. Katniss is in a constant decision-making battle, torn between the selfish and the selfless option, always struggling to do what is right. I could feel her agony at each new turn of events as she faced new challenges and had new choices to make. And did I mention the plot is full of unexpected twists and turns?  Some will be driven away from this story because of the graphic moments, and I completely understand that. Despite all the story's positive elements, it's not a genre I'd want a steady diet of. But I'm glad I read it, I'd read it again, and I'm looking forward to continuing on to the next book, Catching Fire.  There you have it...my very condensed take on Suzanne Collins' masterpiece. Oh, and I should mention that seeing the movie is not the same as reading it. Much of the moral conflict and emotion didn't make it onto the big screen. It's easy to see why; two hours and twenty minutes just can't do justice to a book of this magnitude. But don't trick yourself into thinking you've read Collins' work if you've only seen the movie. The movie is only the tip of the iceberg.  If you'd like to read more of my reviews, visit my book review website: larsenreviews.org
Panem: A Marxist State    Jonathan A. Meyer    Excelsior College    Author Note    This paper was prepared for English 102, English Composition, taught by Professor Kissel    The United States of America have often been described as the "land of opportunity": a place where hard work, dedication and service pay great dividends to the opportunist.  From her economic well-spring, much abundance flows.  Freedom of Speech and Assembly are guaranteed by her Bill of Rights.  Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action enable any person to have a chance to succeed and to be their own provider. For over 400 years now, refugees flocked to her soil for a fresh start. But what if she ceased to be this symbol of independence?    Suzanne Collins, author of the The Hunger Games envisions just such a place in "Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America (Loc. 237-241)". Panem, what I believe to be a Marxist society, is nothing like the forefathers planned for America. Marxism, a socioeconomic ideal, is most-centered around a "continuous conflict between capitalist oppressors and oppressed working people... primary influence on life was economic (Roberts, 300)".    Panem used to be a country of 13 surrounding districts but after the outlying citizens rebelled, the thirteenth was destroyed as an example to not defy the Capitol.  Now, oppression and destitution are the way of life for most of Panem's citizens in its 12 Districts, except the wealthy citizens of the Capitol.  Each person's occupation is predetermined in that they work on the abundant resource available to them in their district and there is little to circumvent this harsh reality. Most people cannot afford to make a living but only a surviving.  Many resort to poaching, haggling and even begging to survive. To keep its citizens in check, the Capitol has devised a "reward campaign" to alleviate starvation for one family once a year. This event is called "The Hunger Games."    Designed as a suppression tactic by the Capitol to keep the districts in line, the games are a lottery/tournament style competition. However, this is where the sadism enters Panem's society. While the districts are mandated to view the gladiator-style Games, 24 contestants a year fight for the prize of guaranteed food rations for the rest of their lives. The winner has to mentor new contestants from their district and help train them in the following years. Also, the tournament is between children above the age of twelve. When a child turns 12, their name is entered in one time. At 13, the name is entered twice and so on until the age of 18. So as your age increases, so do the odds of selection.    The drafting of the children, or "reaping," supports that the Capitol is punishing the districts for their disobedience, or sins. "Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap" (Galatians 6:7, Eastern Standard Version). Simply put, what a person does is repaid to them often more abundantly, in this life or the next. Parents are forced to see their children subject to the possibility of horrible deaths from their past transgressions. Many totalitarian governments act as a deity or remove the deity of their society and not allow their people to worship freely.  The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl sacrifices her "freedom" and volunteers to take the place of her 12-year-old sister, Primrose. Katniss ends up overcoming tremendous odds and difficulties in "The Hunger Games" and is victorious over famine and the Capitol. She singlehandedly rallies people from several districts and other supporters from the Capitol called "sponsors" in believing in her. She has defied the Capitol and she is sure to pay for her actions in the sequel called "Catching Fire."    Panem, is far from the ideals that shaped America. Oppression, humiliation and mutilation are things no person should endure. Freedom to make choices for one's self and their loved ones should be available for all. America may be imperfect but she still shines a beacon of light to tattered nations around the globe.  '    Works Cited  Collins, S. (2008). The Hunger Games. New York, NY: Scholastic Press.

Every year, twenty-four teenage "tributes" are brought to the Capitol of Panem, and sent out into the arena to kill each other on live TV. Only one will survive.  This chilling premise is at the center of "The Hunter Games," the brilliant, powerful first book of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy. It's a slow-burning, brutal, chilling thriller twined with some barbed satire (reality TV!) and an oppressive government -- but at heart, it's an uplifting story about a young woman fighting to be free.  Katniss Everdeen lives in the impoverished District 12, hunting food to provide for her mother and her beloved little sister Prim. But on the day of the reaping, Prim is selected. And Katniss does something no one else has done in a long time -- she volunteers to go instead. Along with the male tribute, Peeta Mellark -- a boy who once helped her at her lowest point -- she is swept away to the Capitol.  Once there, the tributes are pampered, tutored, styled and turned into celebrities -- until they're released into the arena, and start killing each other to survive. Katniss must evade murderous gangs, traps, and genetically engineered beasts.  But after their triumphant first appearance at the Capitol, the audience has taken a shine to the impoverished young "lovers" and are rooting for them to triumph. But if both Katniss and Peeta are to survive, they must learn how to play the game that the gamemakers and polticians are playing -- and use the Hunger Games against them.  A lot has been made of "The Hunger Games'" resemblance to the Japanese franchise "Battle Royale," but honestly the only real similarity is the core concept. Suzanne Collins' world is a far stranger place, set in a futuristic North America where rebellion is brewing against a tyrant. And it seems more to be a barbed, glass-sharp satire on reality TV and how easily people are swayed, either for evil or good.  Suzanne Collins' writing style here takes a little getting used to -- she not only writes everything in the first person, but in the present tense. It's.... a little strange, and it takes some getting used to.  But once you do get used to the odd style, Collins' writing is on fire. She writes in an intense, slow-burning style that is speckled with bittersweet scenes (Katniss singing to Rue) and colorful descriptions (the superficial, sparkly Capitol). But it's also brutally violent at times, with various teens being killed in some truly gruesome ways (broken neck, countless stings, arrows) -- and though Collins doesn't go into graphic detail, it's still pretty shocking.  But at heart, "The Hunger Games" is about one young woman's struggle. Katniss is a struly striking heroine -- she's strong, tough and fiery, as you'd expect of a girl who has been supporting her family, but she has the right amount of vulnerability and kindness. Peeta is a very sweet, sensitive love interest who complements her perfectly, and there's a strong round of supporting characters -- the clever stylist Cinna, the drunken ex-tribute Haymitch, the birdlike Rue, and many others.  "The Hunger Games" is one of those rare books that strikes a deep chord in people's souls -- and it's a beautifully (if oddly) written story with a brilliant heroine. Spellbinding.
Suzanne Collins hits a high mark in fiction with "The Hunger Games" trilogy. One must read the entire series, not just a single book, to fully appreciate the thought and care that went into character development, storytelling, structure and themes. Collins writes in a lean, clear voice that suits her hardscrabble sixteen-year-old narrator and never bogs down the fast-moving plot or blunts the books' emotional impact. I can think of few books in any genre, for any target age group, that are this well-written. If anything, "The Hunger Games" calls to mind Shirley Jackson. Sorry, Ms. Rowling, enjoyable as the Harry Potter books were, Suzanne Collins writes circles around you. The acknowledgments at the end of "Mockingjay" suggest that Collins had able editorial support, which I think Harry Potter's publishers abandoned after "Prisoner of Azkaban" in their frenzy to get product on the shelves.  By now everyone has heard enough about the subject matter that it would be a waste of time to go over it again. I will say I dodged reading "The Hunger Games" for a long time, thinking I had had enough of dystopian fiction, enough of teenagers, and enough of pop-culture frenzy phenomena. I only gave in on the advice of a friend who seldom cares to read novels and could not put the books down. I could not put them down either.  Note for parents: Although most children age nine and up should be able to handle the vocabulary without help, due to the dark, thought-provoking content, I suggest reading along with any child under 13 or perhaps reading the books yourself first before you decide whether to let your child read them.  To address a few criticisms I have seen: (1) I don't really care whether Collins borrowed ideas from Japan's "Battle Royale" book and movie (she claims she did not); "The Hunger Games" stands as its own work of art. (2) While writing in the present tense can seem gimmicky and annoying, Collins uses it effectively to make "The Hunger Games" visceral and intellectually and emotionally authentic. (3) Whether you like the end of Mockingjay will be a matter of taste; I thought it was perfectly suited to what preceded it.  Bravo, well done.
Fell into the craze a little late in the game. The Hunger Games tells of a North America transformed into twelve districts surrounding The Capitol. This Capitol unleashes its control of the districts by having an annual, televised battle-to-the-death between a boy and a girl from each district.  Katniss is our heroine. She's a very capable hunter who must take care of her younger sister, Prim, and battered mother.  When Prim is selected as the girl contender from their district, Katniss volunteers instead. The rest of the story is how this Hunger Game unfolds.  First and foremost I did not like how this book ended. It's probably because Collins planned for the trilogy but the end of the book is just the end of a chapter. I wanted some kind of resolution.  To be sure, The Hunger Games ends but before the book is over, Collins has us continuing the story.  That's my only beef with this story and it is a very small beef (ala McDonalds). The rest of the plot is engaging.  As told in first person from Katniss's point of view, you go along with her thoughts and are never privy to outside information. This keeps the tension high as you will never know what's going to happen next. You don't even know if Katniss will survive. It's all up in the air.  The characters are not fully fleshed out with this first book. There are a few moments when Katniss and her counterpart, Peeta, do some reminiscing. This helps add some meat to their character bones. I'm assuming we'll delve deeper as the books go along.  The violence is interesting. Having twelve through eighteen-year olds tossed into an arena and hunt/murder one another is slightly disturbing and the fact that it has caught fire may say something about our society. But I don't remember graphic descriptions. In fact, I think it was a matter of Collins writing toward our imagination and letting us fill in the detail.  I was also impressed with the lack of swearing. This is a fad that seems to infect ninety-five percent of Young Adult novels. I don't remember any use of profanity. You'd think the kids would be spouting them left and right considering their situation.  In the end (outside of the ending) Collins has started a very rich world. I look forward to what happens next.
I've read this book twice, but the last time was back in October! Time to read it again before the movie comes out. Yes, this book is that good! It is one of my favorite reads. Brings out laughter and sadness and anger and fear...so many emotions and just the right amount of them for me to keep coming back for more.  The Story  The country is dystopian and separated into 13 districts. District 13 was technology, but is lost now. Every year the Capitol (which doesn't have a district designation....because it's the capitol) mandates that each of the districts send up one boy and one girl to the Hunger Games, which is a fight to the death with only one survivor. The lucky kids could volunteer, but really who would do that, or they get chosen at random by pulling their name out of a hat basically. Anywho, Katniss and Peeta get chosen to go into the games for District 12 and the show begins.  Likes  Everything! Seriously though, I pretty much liked everything.  There was a part that made me cry (and even though I wished it could have been different it was important to the story and wouldn't have it changed).  There was the part where Peeta saved her. The part where she saved Peeta. The part where they saved each other.  The part where she shot the arrow in the room where they decide her score.  Dislikes  Uhm.....I didn't like.....okay, in just thinking about the first book, there really wasn't anything I remember disliking. I have complaints about the next two books, but not so much this one.  Conclusion  what I say is this:  If you like YA books and/or if you like dystopian books and/or if you want to try something new if you have not read these types of books before and basically if you are not a strictly non-fiction reader....  READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!
Young adult fiction lately has been flooded by books about Vampires, Witches, Werewolves, and all sorts of paranormal subjects. They have also invaded movies that are for young adults. "The Hunger Games" is here to challenge that clichéd trend.  "The Hunger Games" is in the genre of Science Fiction and Post-Apoocalyptic Fantasy. (So think Mad Max meets Death Race 2000 meets 1984.) That being said, it's not for children below the age of 13.  The setting is a future North America where the nation that was once the United States are divided into 12 Districts ruled by an authoritative regime, al a "1984". And every year, as punishment for the past Civil War between the government and rebels, each District sends two kids, 12 and up, to fight to the death in the arena.  When Katniss Everdeen's sister is chosen to go to the arena, she volunteers to take her younger siblings place.  That is all I'm going to spoil. :)  The plot moves at a very brisk place in the beginning, lags a little in the middle, then moves quickly at the end. The book has many twists you'll never see until they happen. If you love twists in books, "The Hunger Games" is perfect.  When reading the book, I was reminded a lot of Golding's "Lord of the Flies". Having to survive in the arena wore down the participants, many went insane after having to fight tooth and nail, and kill. And the people watching the games, like the tribe of children of "Flies" , cheering as people were killed. And like Ralph in "Flies", Katniss  fights to remain civilized.  Now, before I go on a long literary discussion, let's look at the writing. Collins wrote the book in 1st Person POV, so the only viewpoint in the story you get is Katniss's. I think 1st Person kind of limited the story. I wanted to get into the other character's heads, and learn more about what makes them tick.  As for the use of language, Colllins shines. Imaginary drool dripped down my chin at the way she described food. The technology was described simply, like reading "Farenheit 451" and "Dune". The action scenes were fast and hard-hitting, just as action should be.  Overall, this is a very good book. I give "The Hunger Games" 4 out of 5 stars!
Anyone who sits down to write a book has my admiration. Also, I fully believe that Collins is a talented writer who is bringing to light stories and topics that need our attention. I appreciate her work and vision and perseverance.  Unfortunately "The Hunger Games" series leave me unnourished.  The first book in the series was promising, especially as it carried a trenchant critique of our making a circus of death/survival. In an interview I read Collins expressed being concerned about sending our young people - teenagers - to war and what that does to them and also wondering why people enjoyed the "Survivor" TV show. However the book quickly lost focus and the narrative devolved into something formulaic, violence oriented and without a sense of having learned something. The story was stretched thin (probably so it could last three volumes), became increasingly violent and, worse of all, eviscerated all agency and personality from the initially promising female protagonist whose focus came down to decide between two male love interests. All in all, one of the most disappointing book experiences of my life. Mainly because it started with enormous promise (which was lost even before the first book ended). I'm happy to know that a writer has experienced fame and fortune, but it's at the price of the story that could have been told, a story that we need.  Interestingly, I had a similar experience with her "Gregor the Overlander" series. An utterly fascinating premise and a strong first book. Even the subsequent books in the series have moments of brilliance. However, yet again, she opted for the easy road - increased battles (instead of finding other, more nuanced, ways to evolve relationships/solve conflicts), the assignment of villainy (troublingly, mainly to the women characters) and the outcome in which no growth or much insight was achieved.  At the end of the series (I only skimmed the last book - just as I only skimmed the last two books in the "Hunger Games" series) I was disappointed that all that obvious intellect and storytelling talent ended with very little to show. Then again, I thought, perhaps that's Collins' point. Namely, you have a war and think it'll be the answer when in fact, at the end, there really isn't anything grand at all - no answer or improvement just damage and sadness. So, even though I wasn't happy with it I had to acknowledge that it was a viable choice. By "viable" I mean I could see it as emerging from/organic to the story she told.  However when she did it again in the "Hunger Games" series I was annoyed. After all, it's easy to criticize a society, it's easy to depict conflict and battle (after all, we have generations of stories and books and movies doing that). But unless we find ways to make interesting stories about peace, nonviolent conflict and less-than-perfect-but-workable solutions; unless we make those stories as compelling as the old good vs. evil narrative we'll never be able to imagine, much less live out, a different way of being. I consider it a failure of imagination and narrative laziness to not push oneself beyond the script of battle-victory/hero(ine)-end of story.  Our young people need new stories - the human race needs new stories.
I was excited to read this book, especially with all the hype surrounding it lately with the movie release. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about. So I dove right in.  First, I'll be completely honest. The book started out extremely slow. The first couple chapters were interesting, inviting the reader into the idea quickly. But it trailed off quickly -- so quickly that I was bored to the point of almost putting it down at chapter 5. But I thought to myself, "There's so much hype, there must be something more." So I skipped 5 chapters to chapter 10 and started skimming from there to see if I'd reached something of interest. Finally, the story was taking off again.  The basis of the story is this: A poor society comprised of several districts ruled by a wealthy government are forced to compete in what come to be known as "The Hunger Games". The Games were started as punishment for an uprising the poor districts of the society waged against the government, but the governing body defeated the rebellion and crushed the poor under even heavier burdens.  The rules of the hunger games were simple. Representatives were selected from each of the 12 societal districts, placed into an "arena", and forced to fight each other to the death. Last man (or woman) standing won food and riches for his (or her) family. But here's the catch: the combatants were mere teen-agers.  No novel would be complete without a quasi-love story infused into it (because what good is blood and carnage among fighting children without a love story, right?). The combatants fight their way down to the last 2 remaining...uh...lovebirds.  And what good is a love story among blood and carnage waged by children against other children than a good old fashioned "Romeo and Juliet" scheme to wrap it all up?  I will admit, the idea of the story was intriguing. People who don't know each other and who have done each other no wrong other than living in "opposing" districts are forced to fight to the death for the hopeful benefit of their respective families. It speaks rather loudly of the depravity of our human condition. Where does a person (or society) draw the line in the sand saying, "We will go this far and no farther!" ? When do we say, "We will not bow to the Establishment!" ?  While the book raises some interesting societal issues (issues I'm sure someone could relate to war and greed and government in our day), I was disturbed the author chose the main players of the Games to be children. I wasn't offended, just disturbed. Maybe that's because we expect these kinds of stories with adult victims, not children. When we bring children into the equation, however, I think we are forced to think our positions through a bit further than we originally would have.  What would you do if your family was in that situation?  Would you stand up and fight?  Or would you cower in fear?  I give The Hunger Games 3 1/2 stars out of 5, primarily due to its predictability and slow start. The idea was intriguing, so it deserved at least 3 for provocation and thoughtfulness.

I finally succumbed to peer pressure, I'm weak, but for whatever my two cents might be worth in this ever changing economy here is my take on Hunger Games. First let me issue a disclaimer in that I read this book expecting the worst. I'd held off reading Suzanne Collins' book because the very premise, as I understood it, made me queasy, and although I can lock and load as well as most Southern women I've no stomach for senseless killing. That said I was surprised, and give the book 4*.  So with the same trepidation with which I read Twilight, no one does vamps like Ann Rice, I should do as well as Stephenie Meyer's, and I would have a lovely new beach house. Again a big surprise. I began Hunger Games and I couldn't put down my Kindle until two in the morning and three days later.  By now you've read a gazillion reviews that praise the book and a few that consider the writing simplistic. I think the Hunger Games is neither. Over 6 thousand readers at www.Amazon.com gave the book 4.5 * so I won't waste your time with technicalities. For me, I found the book to be mesmerizing in the way people pass by terrible accidents and are unable to look away. For a writer who loves to read with a passion the book hooked me from the get go and that makes any book a success.  Everyone, so it seems, has interpreted a different message in the book, and in listening to the debates I imagine Ms. Collins cringing at some of the comments. I only read the one and have not decided if I'll read the other two books yet. The Hunger Games is still digesting. Listening to the few interviews Ms. Collins gave, I hope my take doesn't make her shudder. In her interview, she referred to reality TV as having, in part, inspired her Trilogy. That speaks volumes for TV and not in a positive light.  My one pervading thought, which I've been unable to shake since reading The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, is "All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing." (Edmund Burke).  Today there are so many things happening all around we need to remember that yes one person can make a difference. One vote at a time, one person and one voice at a time, then eventually the one becomes many.[...]
As usual I headed over to the 1 star review section to see what those folks had to say about this book before posting my own 5 star take on the events. The ones I read fascinated me because it seems like me and those people read two different books. Some called this book boring, predictable and cliche. Really? Seriously? The only thing I found typical is the fact that the main character is torn between two guys like the main female character of nearly every young adult book that's out right now. But the comparisons stop there. Even the way she's caught between them is unique rather than the typical empty minded boy crazy girls you read about now that flit from guy to guy simply going on about how good they look or how much they long to have sex with them. A lot of the one stars just seemed like haters, plain and simple. If the book was so boring, why did they continue reading it instead of just putting it down after a chapter or two. There's even a horrible parody book of The Hunger Games in circulation now and all I can say is that has to be a first. A book has a parody?? I've never heard of that happening! You know you're book is huge when there's someone taking time out of their life to try and make another version of your book! The parody is bad, by the way, just in case you're wondering. I read a few pages and felt sorry for not only the author, but the publishers who paid them because they didn't have anything to do.  As far as this book goes, I was crying by the second or third chapter. Not boo-hooing or anything severe, but this book is very touching. Unless you're a heartless prick, this book will touch you in certain areas. If Suzanne Collins got her idea of this from somewhere else, I've never heard of it, and I've never read anything quite like this. This book is like The Help (the book, not the movie)--in that I believe it deserves all the good praise it gets. I'm pretty sure the movie will not be as good as this book, but I'm dying to see it anyway. At least Suzanne Collins had a hand in writing the script, unlike some, so at least a lot of the basic concepts are kept. Not only that, but I'm dying to read the second book of the trilogy. Do yourself a favor and read this. Ignore the negativity, you'll be glad you did.
After countless months of hearing about the Hunger Game, I became curious to see whether or not the hype was all that it was cracked up to be. I read the book the day before I was about to see the movie. I didn't expect to completely finish the book, but I did. Let me tell you, this is a book that you just cannot stop reading. I stayed up till 4a.m. just to finish the ending.  Oh, by the way, I thought the movie was a let down.  What I liked about the book was that the love story wasn't the main focus for the book. The capitol's cruel maltreatment towards it's people was the main focus. I love books that convey a sense of helplessness to one's environment/ situation in life, yet finding some way to screw with the system to get a supposedly fair and just democracy. (my favorite book is the Invisible Man by Ellison). In these types of books you always have the main character as this smart, yet naive young adult who thinks the world is exactly how they see it. They do not see that they are simply just a chess piece in another person's game. In Hunger Games, this is Katniss. Katniss is a 16 year old girl who volunteers to compete in the game in place of her sister. Katniss is incapable of loving and sharing her world with another person besides her sister. This cold approach to the world manages to be her biggest asset in the game. Without seeing the other competitors as people she could be friends with let alone relate to, she is able to stay focused in the game to what is important: staying alive for her sister. She is able to pick up on the system Haymitch has developed for her to get gifts from sponsors. A kiss meant you get soup.  I don't know exactly why, but my favorite character from the whole series is Haymitch. Even though he is always in the background of these games, you can't help but feel as though he is always steps ahead of all the people that surround him. He drinks because of his knowledge of how the capitol works and his inability to do anything about it. He is a lot like Katniss. He doesn't let others into his world in fear that the capital would have something to use against him in case he acts out of line.  When I think of the Hunger Games, I can't shake the deep presence of how the Greek olympics must have been like.To me, Hunger Games would be the futuristic Greek olympics. What it would look like if T.V.s were around.
I give this book (and the other three in the trilogy) two stars - I wanted to give it three, one for each of them, but that didn't seem quite right.  "The Hunger Games" was entertaining enough that I read it and got swept up in the hype surrounding it enough to finish the other two as well.  I'm glad it only took a week to read all three so a large chunk of my life wasn't wasted.  These are the first books that I've read about this premise, so I gave it two stars for the storyline.  However, after reading quite a few reviews, I see that maybe it wasn't so novel afterall.  Either way, it was entertaining.  And that's about all I can say that's good about this trilogy.  It was predictable.  (So very predictable.)  It was clearly written for a seventh grader or close to, so I tried to ignore the writing style and use of cliches.  I tried my best to call upon my inner 13-year-old and love these books.  But I couldn't do it.  And the main reason I couldn't love these books is because of the "heroine."  She is shallow, selfish, egotistical, and manipulative - but not very smart.  I wouldn't have minded if she was manipulative in other ways the author could have made her be - against the Capitol, against the Gamesmakers.  But, without giving any spoilers, I'll just say that she wasn't.  I kept reading hoping to see the character growth over the three books and that all of these traits would be gone by the end and we'd have a heroine to actually admire...  But no.  Her character really left a lot to be desired, and by the end of the third book, I felt like there had been no growth at all, no development, no maturity - she was just Katniss.  The story as a whole was likable enough to keep reading, but Katniss was not likable enough to actually care what happened to her.  Friends argued that Katniss was selfless, volunteering for her sister.  While that may have been her only redeeming action, in my opinion, she did it for egotistical reasons.  "Look at me, I'm doing what no one from District 12 has ever done before.  Look at me, saving my sister, because my sister's too weak to ever survive herself."  The author didn't make me believe her motives.  I don't understand the hype surrounding these books.  They weren't deep enough to make me really think about society or the character flaws of humans in any way, like some books can.  They weren't well written enough to take a journey with a character through her evolution.  They were just some books, that were entertaining enough, but forgettable.  I don't usually leave reviews, but I am just at a loss of the hysteria surrounding these books, and am glad to see that I'm not totally alone.
This book takes us on a journey of conquest, and represents a modern day, very American, version of the Illiad.  Survival, in a brutal, gladiatorial world amounts just as much to obtaining good audience response, in the Hollywood environment, under constant televised scrutiny, as to one's facility with weapons.  Each year, two teenagers, one a boy and one a girl, are chosen from each of the twelve districts that pay tribute to the Capitol, the realm of the "gods", to participate in the games that demonstrate the absolute control of the Capitol over the lives and livelihoods of people in the districts.  Welcome to North America of the future.   The narration is from the point of view of the "lucky" girl from district 12 chosen to compete in this year's games.  She plays the role, not only of Helen of Troy, of the Iliad, but of Paris, in the end using an arrow to strike at the vulnerable point of the "Achilles" of the tale.  It is extremely interesting to see the war before the "plains of Illium", from the point of view of the character who is treated as so cowardly in the actual Illiad.  The author is sufficiently skillful that she makes what could easily be a rather repulsive character into a tragic figure, and I think at the end of the book, just as if we had witnessed a performance of a Greek tragedy, we are privy to her erroneous view of the world, while at the same time feeling very sympathetic toward her as a human being caught in an unwinnable situation.   I found myself wondering, in the end, who the gods were.  The people of the Capitol seemed just as much caught up in the Hollywood fakery as the girl in the gladiatorial competition.  They all seemed to represent tragic figures, puppets in the hands of the gods behind the scenes to whom we never have any direct contact.  The Capitol proves in the end to be just as much as a gladiatorial arena as that of the games.  Who are the gods?  Certainly, the "fall of Troy" does not seem to end the tale by any means.  It whet my appetite for the second volume in the series, despite the brutal, harsh nature of this first volume.   I found the writing to be superb.  The author has a real gift for timing and for posing puzzles that she can resolve in interesting ways.  On the other hand, although this is a book about teenagers, its tragic unfolding and its brutal plot are very serious, and strike Americans at the heart of their Hollywood mentality, and fixation with materialism and technology.  This is a tragedy built around greed and ultimately one that is quite meaningful for Americans as a whole, not just for teenagers.  I recommend this book, but the world it displays is a terrible world, perhaps bearing too close an affinity with the actual world.
I have had this book gathering dust on my shelf for an obscene amount of time. In truth, I put off reading it because there are so many other books on my "To Read" list &amp; when a push back happens, it's the YA novels that take it for the team. I'm glad to say that this was very much worth the read.  I know that everything to be said about this book &amp; the entire series has likely been said, but I cannot let it go without saying that what struck me most &amp; I find I am most interested in is, the Capitol, its inhabitants &amp; how this entire society has devolved into this place we're transported too. Katniss as the narrator, took my breath away sometimes because she had a way of relating the matter-of-factness of some things &amp; a seeming complacency for others. She could see inherent unfairness in the way things were set up to the advantage of the Capitol but didn't seem to bear any in her own district for not being the sorts to band together &amp; offer assistance to one another in dire situations (her family almost starved to death when her father died &amp; she knows that others have met that same fate). It struck me as an interesting study in "Us vs. Them". The same is touched on with the Avox girl, that Katniss recognizes.  Panem is a rough place all around. The feeling of helplessness is used as a weapon to wear people down &amp; fear is used to keep people in their own district &amp; not inclined to venture out to others for information or banding together. The Capitol must have great intimidation PR because the fences aren't electrified 24/7 but people haven't crossed in masses to meet.  As to the games themselves, I admit to feeling uneasy as I read this because I felt like a spectator (&amp; of course that's the point). But, I am not a watcher of reality television. I haven't the fortitude for it. It makes me nervous, uncomfortable &amp; I have a tendency to feel embarrassed for others &amp; like I'm seeing something I shouldn't. Simply put, I'm an atrocious gawker. I don't want to see humanity at its worst &amp; the idea of the Hunger Games or Flesh Fair (from the film A.I.) all playing out while people sit and watch, placing bets &amp; having parties nags at my psyche. That said, I will read the remainder of the series because I need to know how this society resolves &amp; characters reconcile.
Every year, twenty-four teenage "tributes" are brought to the Capitol of Panem, and sent out into the arena to kill each other on live TV. Only one will survive.  This chilling premise is at the center of "The Hunter Games," the brilliant, powerful first book of Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy. It's a slow-burning, brutal, chilling thriller twined with some barbed satire (reality TV!) and an oppressive government -- but at heart, it's an uplifting story about a young woman fighting to be free.  Katniss Everdeen lives in the impoverished District 12, hunting food to provide for her mother and her beloved little sister Prim. But on the day of the reaping, Prim is selected. And Katniss does something no one else has done in a long time -- she volunteers to go instead. Along with the male tribute, Peeta Mellark -- a boy who once helped her at her lowest point -- she is swept away to the Capitol.  Once there, the tributes are pampered, tutored, styled and turned into celebrities -- until they're released into the arena, and start killing each other to survive. Katniss must evade murderous gangs, traps, and genetically engineered beasts.  But after their triumphant first appearance at the Capitol, the audience has taken a shine to the impoverished young "lovers" and are rooting for them to triumph. But if both Katniss and Peeta are to survive, they must learn how to play the game that the gamemakers and polticians are playing -- and use the Hunger Games against them.  A lot has been made of "The Hunger Games'" resemblance to the Japanese franchise "Battle Royale," but honestly the only real similarity is the core concept. Suzanne Collins' world is a far stranger place, set in a futuristic North America where rebellion is brewing against a tyrant. And it seems more to be a barbed, glass-sharp satire on reality TV and how easily people are swayed, either for evil or good.  Suzanne Collins' writing style here takes a little getting used to -- she not only writes everything in the first person, but in the present tense. It's.... a little strange, and it takes some getting used to.  But once you do get used to the odd style, Collins' writing is on fire. She writes in an intense, slow-burning style that is speckled with bittersweet scenes (Katniss singing to Rue) and colorful descriptions (the superficial, sparkly Capitol). But it's also brutally violent at times, with various teens being killed in some truly gruesome ways (broken neck, countless stings, arrows) -- and though Collins doesn't go into graphic detail, it's still pretty shocking.  But at heart, "The Hunger Games" is about one young woman's struggle. Katniss is a struly striking heroine -- she's strong, tough and fiery, as you'd expect of a girl who has been supporting her family, but she has the right amount of vulnerability and kindness. Peeta is a very sweet, sensitive love interest who complements her perfectly, and there's a strong round of supporting characters -- the clever stylist Cinna, the drunken ex-tribute Haymitch, the birdlike Rue, and many others.  "The Hunger Games" is one of those rare books that strikes a deep chord in people's souls -- and it's a beautifully (if oddly) written story with a brilliant heroine. Spellbinding.
In a dystopian future world, a plentiful society exists in a place called the Capitol which oversees 12 poverty-stricken Districts to produce specific products to maintain their charmed lives. As a way of re-affirming their dominance over the Districts (as well as provide a sadistic entertainment to the twisted rulers), they demand 2 "tributes" in the form of one boy and one girl between the ages of 12-18 to travel to the Capitol and be placed in a vast arena to survive and fight to the death. These televised trials are called "The Hunger Games". This is the story of a 16 year old girl called Katniss Everdeen from District 12 who is one of the chosen.  I heard about this book a few years ago in Stephen King's Entertainment Weekly column but I decided not to read it as it was labelled "Young Adult" (YA) (I'm not a teenager) and because it seemed like a knockoff "Battle Royale", a superb Japanese film I'd seen in 2000 which has a very similar premise. Having read the book, in hindsight both of these reasons were ridiculous. The YA label is arbitrary at best and, reading it, I couldn't understand why this book is considered to be a teen book and not one for adults. Maybe the lack of swearing, sex, and overly descriptive violent scenes?  And the "Battle Royale" argument (which seems to bother a number of reviewers), well was that the first book to feature kids on an island killing each other? Has no-one read "Lord of the Flies"? Shirley Jackson wrote maybe the best haunted house novel with "The Haunting of Hill House" - does that mean Richard Matheson's "Hell House" or Stephen King's "The Shining" are invalid because they followed in her wake? Or Yevgeny Zamyatin's "We" preceded both Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" and George Orwell's "Nineteen Eighty-Four", so do we discount Huxley and Orwell entirely? Just because a concept has been done before, doesn't mean it can't be done again - and done better at that.  "The Hunger Games" is an exceptionally thrilling read. Suzanne Collins has crafted a compelling portrait of a world unrecognisable to our own, both futuristic and historic at varying times, but the best part of the book is, as it should be, the Games itself. Once Katniss enters the arena with the 23 other teens, I couldn't stop reading and finished the book on my second sitting, it was that exhilarating to read. Her battle to survive both on the basic level of eating and drinking what she could find, while escaping her would-be murderers, was a unique reading experience that I've never come across before and Collins does a fantastic writing job throughout. The survival part of the book echoed another excellent series of YA books I read when I was a teenager, Gary Paulsen's "Hatchet" books (highly recommended by the way), while the many Roman references made it seem like an extended teen "Gladiator".  I won't give away anything about the story here but suffice it to say that there are betrayals and killings that you don't see coming, and constant suspense throughout (even though you know Katniss makes it). Like I say, I don't know why this isn't considered an adult book but any adults reading this review should give this novel a go, ignore the YA label, it's very well written, very well-conceived, and an amazing action-thriller with elements of sci-fi thrown in. Excellent fun, I bought the other two books immediately after finishing this and can't wait to find out how this series continues.
Well now I certainly know what all the hype is about! I was really reluctant to read this because all of the hype was so over whelming. I never experienced this feeling with my favorite series Twilight because I fell in love with it before all of the hype began. It definitely lived up to the hype all of the way. It is stylish, exciting fresh and new. It is a brilliant Dystopian novel.  With all of the Dystopian novels out there I can never get enough of them for some reason. I know its such a bleak genre right? Right. But their filled with so much excitement! I found the events leading up to The Hunger Games interesting but was really holding my breath for them to start and when they did oh my! It captivated me and kept my face glued to my Kindle. The world inside and outside of the arena was so well developed; Panem is soooo not a place I want to live in. A lot of the animals,plants and just the world of Panem was extremely unique and kept me interested.  Because of the action and constant flow of the story there wasn't a lot of room for character development but the little bit we get on secondary characters is really extraordinary given the pace of the story. I really loved Katniss and Rue....hate thinking about Rue.... but I loved her! The only thing I didn't like about Katniss was how she second guessed Peeta so much, it got kind of annoying for me. I thought she was a wonderful heroine though.  Was I totally captivated? Yes. Is it my favorite series? No. However,  I own the other two books in the series and will be reading them soon. There is a lot coming out in the movies that I want to see....The Raven anyone? So, I'll have to see  if I can see the movie if not will definitely will catch it on DVD.  Rating: 5/5  Rated: Pg-13 Brutal, Brutal Violence but nothing a teen hasn't seen before.
Fascinated by the hype the film's opening generated, and the fact that my 13 year old (boy) stated 'the books are the best and I cant wait to see the film' I decided to find out myself what all the fuss is about.  Three books later, and after several intense conversations with those (adults) who have seen the film (I have not), I find myself faced with the dilemma - Is this review of a childrens' series? Is it a review of a political and social veiled commentary? Is it a review of an adults series? I am unsure. The story centers around a 'country/world' (it is never clear), where a ruthless regime (aspects of which bear a striking resemblance to North Korea, Burma and recent events in Syria), maintain control through fear, manipulation, cruelty and hunger. However adults in this story play either a villianous or secondary role, children are the regimes main targets, source of opposition, heros (perhaps) and victims.  As an adult and a parent I found this both distressing and confusing. Joseph Kony and other african warlords have obviously inspired the author.  But to the story! The evil regime having faced an uprising in the past has determined that every year each district must select two children to represent them in The Hunger Games. The world of the Hunger Games is divided into the 'Capitol' (evil, controlling, home of the president, materialistic and most definately not hungry) and the districts each with a singular purpose (farming, mining, manufacturing) that have varying population levels and are portrayed as basically concentration camps where the population is starved, beaten and controlled by the ruthless armies (peacekeepers) of the 'Capitol'. The games themselves are gladitorial. Each child goes into a man made world with the sole aim of killing every other child, and thus achieving both victory, survival and food. Of course none of this can happen until each child is groomed and paraded around to the citizens of the capitol, who obviously have no issue with media manipulation, child abuse and child murder. Oliver Stone in Natural Born Killers parodied a similiar media obsession.  Our protagonist 'Katniss' is a 17 year old female from District 12, portrayed as one of the hungriest camps, in fact Katniss' greatest skill is creeping out of the confines of her camp to hunt successfully (with a bow and arrow) for food, many in her camp/district are in her debt for keeping them alive. Obviously Katniss is selected for the games. I wont give away the ending in the first book or in fact at the end of the third but it is as unexpected as expected. Themes of hunger are well represented and food and its consumption fill great numbers of pages, as do the author's annoying habit of spending many pages flashing back on Katniss' memories, the only purpose for this appears to be the desire to reiterate (over and over again) the rationale for her behaviour. Because despite the situation she finds herself in, the supporting characters and her past she is hard to like or understand.  The Hunger Games if more subtle and better written could have been a truly great trilogy for adults. If fewer complex themes, more behavioural analysis, well rounded characters and a purposeful blackness and futility had been applied it could have been a series worth series academic and educational attention. It is neither, adults who have seen the film are appalled at the violence and premise (these adults are not wowsers). My own reaction? Shock. Shock that these books resonate with our children and shock that there has been no real discussion regarding the themes and events portrayed in them.
Did I enjoy this book: Yes, I loved it the first time I read it. And after this second reading, I still love it every bit as much. The action in this book is fast paced and keeps you glued to the book from the very beginning.  I can honestly say that I read this book every free chance I had both times I have read it. Even the second time around, I found it hard to put this book down to take care of the every day stuff that needed to be done. I just couldn't wait to see what happened next!  This was the first dystopian YA book I had ever read. What a way to break into a genre!! This book was exciting, emotional, enraging, and enthralling! (I can't believe I described this book with all 'e' words.) It's hard to imagine a world like this, but this book is written so well that I can imagine a world like this - as sad as that is. Ms. Collins is an amazing writer. The world she built can be pictured clearly. I can see the absurdity of the Capitol and its citizens - what it looks like, how they dress, what they eat. I can see the despair of the districts - the poverty, the hurt, the defeat.  Katniss is a great heroine. She isn't perfect...far from it, in fact. But she is strong, she is a provider, she is a survivor. I like her no nonsense approach to her life and her lot. She does what she needs to do in order to protect those who love her. She is funny, too. Ms. Collins writes some funny dialogue and thoughts. One of my favorite thoughts of Katniss is from Chapter 2: "Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I"m trying to slit his throat."  Haymitch is fantastic. He is just like Katniss...or should I say that Katniss is just like him? They are great together and truly seem to get one another. His messages to Katniss in the arena are clear and understood by Katniss.  Peeta and Gale both love Katniss. Only one can have her. I have a favorite. I'm not going to say who it is because if you haven't read this book, I don't want to give anything away! However, if you haven't read this book yet...WHY NOT??? Seriously, go get it immediately and read it!  Would I recommend it: Absolutely!!!  Will I read it again: Yes, I will. Probably once a year...especially right before the release of the movie sequels.  [...]
Before I begin, I'll be the first to admit that I was expecting a lot, going into this. With all the hype surrounding the upcoming *The Hunger Games* movie and several members of my extended family gushing about how great the books are, I figured it would be amazing. Unfortunately, it just... wasn't.  *The Hunger Games* is split into three parts: "The Tributes," "The Games," and "The Victor." (Note: while there are also three novels in the series, I am speaking only of the first novel, which is itself divided into the aforementioned parts.) What's interesting is that while many books increase in intensity from start to finish, this one is more like a bell curve. Part I (comprising chapters 1-9) begins a bit slowly, as it necessarily lays the groundwork for the story ahead. This, of course, is to be expected, and by the end of Part I, I had come to know and love the main protagonist. As Part II (chapters 10-18) begins, I was finally fully engaged in the story, and I loved every minute of it, constantly clamoring for more.  But then I got to Part III.  I'm not sure what was going through Suzanne Collins' mind as she wrote the third and concluding part of this novel, but it is, in a word, boring. It is so bad that there were several times I was about to close the book for good, and just not waste my time seeing how it ended. Still, I persevered, confident that since so many people think it's so great, there had to be something worthwhile at the end, something that would make this tremendous monotony worth it. The problem is: there isn't.  After slogging through almost 100 pages of boredom, I finally arrived at the climax of the novel, only to be presented with a ridiculous, contrived, final battle that wasn't even exciting while it happened. And then, once it was finally over and I got to enjoy the results, there are still another 30 pages of slogging boredom before I finally read "END OF BOOK ONE"--as if I'd actually subject myself to two more novels of this.  I realize, of course, that I'm not in the "young adult" target audience, but I enjoy several other novels of that genre. "Young Adult" doesn't necessarily mean "catering to tweenage pop culture," but the climax was definitely just that.  I'd also like to point out one of my three stars is because *The Hunger Games* is completely and utterly devoid of adult language and sexual situations, a feature I wish were found in more of modern literature. Even one of my favorite books of all time, *Ender's Game*, doesn't have that feature.  So, all in all, a book that really failed to impress, but that I might read again, someday, at least in part. I'd still love to know what other people find so compelling, and maybe I'll find it on the second reading.
**SPOILER ALERT**  I have to admit, I was a litte wary of this book at first. So many people said so many different things about it and I didn't know what to expect. So when I finally bought it and read through it I was pleasantly surprised.  The beginning of the book is amazing, with obvious love between Katniss and Prim. I love how their mother is a catatonic zombie half of the time, making her present, but not all there leaving Katniss to feed them all. I also admit to loving Gale at first, more on that later.  When we actually get to the tributes and all that "fun" stuff, it's heartbreaking when Prim get's chosen and then Katniss volunteers. I remember thinking, 'oh no, tell me Gale isn't going to get picked too.' And he wasn't! Then I read more about Peeta and I was irritated because he was a cool guy.  Then the actual Games started and the diologue pretty much stopped. I thought that would bother me because there was hardly any diologue. I was given the facts of what was happening and what Katniss was thinking and that was it. But it was a surprisingly enjoyable part of the novel.  I grew to love the characters and nearly cried a few times like the big baby I am. Then they announced that if two tributes from the same district survive to the end, they will both win, I was thrilled! I could see Katniss and Peeta actually falling in love with each other, even if Katniss didn't realize it, and it was enjoyable.  Blah blah blah, skip all the next stuff because you probably don't care at this minute. Then we get all the way to the end and Katniss crushes Peeta and I wanted to reach into my kindle and strangle her to death. Of course it was all Gale's fault that she crushed Peeta because she realized that she MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE FEELINGS FOR THE SHMUCK! I was so irritated, but in a good way. Now I just really want to read the next book and find out what happens.
I saw the movie the other day and was intrigued enough by the concept to want to read the book. It is a great premise for a dystopian novel. I think I enjoyed the concept much more than the actual book--and I give credit to the author for coming up with a such a unique and creative story. The "reaping" reminded me of the haunting classic short story by Shirley Jackson "The Lottery" and I was impressed to see how Collins expanded this concept and put such a fascinating twist to it. When reading a dystopian novel, one does have to extend their beliefs a bit -- satires like this are meant to magnify the darkest aspects of human nature and so I had no difficulty in accepting the premise of the storyline.  Children from the most repressed societies selected at random to fight to the death for the entertainment of the upper-classes. Here in America, where we send our poor and repressed to war to fight for us and where our entertainment largely comes from reality TV, it does not seem so far-fetched! But the plot isn't even that simple, the politics of the battle go beyond strategy and survival in the ring--participants (or Tributes) are further humiliated by having to secure sponsorships, which greatly increase their chances of survival, by trying to win the favor of the very people that put them there to suffer.  While reading the book itself, I enjoyed it and was surprised to see that the movie remained largely true to the story. However, I was disappointed with the character development. I did not feel connected to any of them really--and often felt confused by them and their motives. I think this is what failed to make it a great story! There was so much I would have liked to have known about Peeta, about Haymitch, the other tributes, even Katniss the main character herself seemed to fall short in character development--and I got the feeling that the author meant to write this book as a vehicle to deliver a message rather than write a story.  Even with the shortcomings, I am hooked and cannot wait to read the following books. I get the feeling that a love triangle is developing and wonder if this series will take the place of Twilight in winning over the young adult masses with Gale versus Peeta camps starting up. But then I haven't read the sequels yet either to know where the author intends to go next.
I came to this book a wary of all the buzz surrounding it -- the last time I read something my sister recommended me it was Twilight, and that was a disaster...  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Suzanne Collins's "Hunger Games" delves into more realistic themes and issues than other popular teen reads (Harry Potter, Twilight). Whereas Harry Potter and Twilight deal mostly with personal issues -- making friends, finding love, gaining confidence -- Katniss, the main character, begins with her strong personality already formed. Katniss's strength despite harsh conditions reminded me of the characters in Margaret Peterson Haddix's Shadow Children series, who lived in a world where every third child was supposed to be executed because of overpopulation. Katniss was a solid character, but her relationship with Peeta felt very forced, even knowing that it was a ruse to begin with, which I think was the major weakness of the novel. It felt like it was just thrown in there to appease teen readers, which was a little disappointing but what can you expect? *sigh*  What impressed me was Hunger Games's critique of the vanity, selfishness, and wastefulness of modern existence. Katniss comes from one of the least wealthy districts and is forced to fight for her life in order to entertain people with higher social positions and more money. The districts are stratified by industry. Katniss's district (the lowest) is mining, and the others in ascending order are: agriculture, livestock, textiles, lumber, transportation, power, fishing, electronics, heavy industry, and the Capitol produces luxuries. The basic idea here is that the people in the least essential industries hold the most power. Doesn't this seem familiar? It seems to reflect the way football players and actors are given high salaries while the proletariat are given no respect and very few opportunities for advancement (sure, you can argue that education up to grade 12 is free, but what can you do without a college degree anymore?).  I applaud this book for preparing young (and old) people to recognize and cope with the problems that the wealth gap creates in society, and for rightly portraying as disgusting people who spend all their time trying to make themselves look beautiful and keep themselves entertained while the world goes to s***. I think we're on the edge of a real change in the way people become more aware of the ways they are inadvertently exploiting others, as books like this, movements like Occupy, and initiatives like Fair Trade bring the struggles of the lower classes into mass consciousness. Basically, the new ethics that is emerging is the ethics of not consuming more than you need, and finding a way to share the bounty with those that are less fortunate (okay, well, it's not exactly new, but it's becoming more important as we start to realize that consuming to excess is both physically and mentally degrading to ourselves -- think obesity and Kardashians).  Being socially conscious isn't an easy thing to do (because it involves breaking habits that we love to indulge), but it's a healthy thing to aspire to both at an individual and societal level.
It took some time to sort out why I was disappointed in this book.  I wondered if it was the writing, the main character, the whole premise of the book, or if it was simply that I'm an adult reading a novel for adolescents, so I was expecting too much.  I don't think it's this last one, though, for a few reasons.  So I started looking at some of the things that bothered me about the book, and I think what it really boils down to is the writing and the author's choice of first person, present tense point of view.  Too often the author felt the need to "tell" what is happening with the character by having her state what's going on, rather than letting it show, or *only* letting it show.  I know this might be difficult in first person POV, but it can be done.  (I think the novel would've been stronger if she had just chosen a different mode.)  (****spoiler alert****)  The most cringe-worthy moment  of Katniss pointing out the obvious is in chapter 18 a little bit after  the 12-year old tribute dies.  Right when it happens, we hear Katniss' thoughts, how she finally understands something Peeta had said, and she takes actions that show something in her has changed.  Then she gets the bread from the little girl's district, and I actually got a little teary-eyed.  I thought that was such a great moment--the best in the book.  Just a few pages later, though, we hear Katniss start prattling on in her mind about how Rue's death changed her, how now she wants revenge, blah, blah, blah.  The author shouldn't have had to point that out.  We knew (or we hoped), that something in her changed.  We saw what she did in the meadow before they took the body away, how she saluted her fellow tribute.  We saw when Katniss slipped into a brief depression, didn't want to get out of the tree, didn't want to move anymore, and had to order herself to get going.  The author should have left it alone.  Having Katniss point out the obvious like this makes her seem more self-absorbed and shallow than what is probably intended.  But, too, her stating that she wants revenge at this point isn't really a change.  She already hates the Capitol, what it does to starve people to death in her own district, and she raves against it with Gale in the woods all the time.  So what's new there?  I don't know.  I guess it's just that she's finally coming to realize it?  So is it just that she's learned something about herself here?  The change I suppose I was looking for was for her to actually step outside of herself and her emotional angst just a little more, start being able to connect to others a little better, to risk trusting people (other than girls who remind her of her harmless sister), to see they have a common cause (the other district sent her that precious loaf of bread!!).  But instead she just continues being suspicious and of others' motives all the time.  The scene of Katniss' depression brings me to another point.  I thought it was odd that she doesn't think of her mother's own struggle with depression after her father's death.  Yes, Katniss does far better than her mother in recovering, but it makes her seem pretty shallow and self-absorbed to not be just a little bit humbled in her judgment of her mother.  As a kid, she has every right to be angry that her mother didn't take care of her and her sister.  But, as a book for young adults, this would be a great moment to see some character development, to see Katniss growing into a more aware adult.  Even just a little.  Maybe she doesn't completely forgive her mother, but maybe she understands her a little better.  I think her own emotional wounds, like her mother's, have led her to cut herself off from others.  (***End Spoilers***)  I don't mean to say that I think Katniss should be some perfect hero.  I prefer my characters to be complex, to have struggles, to be not-quite-good or not-quite-bad.  The characters in the Song of Fire and Ice (Game of Thrones) series are excellent examples.  But Katniss didn't come across as very complex at all to me.  Her constant questioning of everyone's motives and going on and on about not wanting to owe people makes her pretty tiresome after a while.  I think she has the potential to be a lot more compelling, and I mostly blame the writing choices for her character falling so flat.  Maybe she'll do more growing the subsequent books.  I hope so, because I still plan to read them, just to see.  If I'm still left disappointed, at least I've only lost a few days of reading.  Unfortunately, I also find the whole world of the Hunger Games fairly unbelievable, too.  I reread Ender's Game a few years ago, and I liked it nearly as much as when I read it in high school.  That's one reason why I don't think my problems with the The Hunger Games can be chalked up to it being fiction for young adults.  Like Katniss, Ender goes through some pretty horrible abuses at the hands of the state, but I never found myself getting weary of Ender or being unable to suspend my disbelief.  I've ready plenty of dystopian books, but I found myself more confused by this world than drawn into it.  I haven't put my finger on why this is, but have a sense that there's a disjunct between this tyrannical government and the way the Hunger Games are broadcast as reality TV.  Something about this arrangement doesn't seem quite believable to me.  Maybe it's because I've never watched that much reality TV?  Or maybe it's just the limited first-person POV again?  I've giving it 3 stars because Amazon says this means I think "it's okay" rather than two stars, which means "I don't like it."  Probably, I'm somewhere in between.  It's a quick read, and worth reading to know the story everyone's talking about.  And I can't help but like most dystopian novels, regardless of their flaws, because it's always interesting to take a peek into some crazy, things-gone-wrong world that someone has invented.
This book begins with a compelling premise, but fails the reader by leaving it undeveloped.  Even allowing for the fact that it is considered young adult fiction, the main characters are vapid and superficial.  The author expects us to believe that Katniss, plucked from an impoverished, oppressed existence suddenly turns into a giddy teenager when presented with the baubles of her oppressors, just before they send her to her likely death.  Readers are further expected that Katniss and Peeta--each in their mid-teens, leading world-weary lives back home--don't have a clue about sex or romance, nor have experienced the feelings that accompany either.  These teenagers should be behaving more like old souls (or adults, at least) but their banter belies the fact that their emotional ages are somewhere between very sheltered ten to tweleve-year-olds. I love dystopian novels and I'm not squeamish about fictional depictions of brutality, but Collins ultimately squanders her opportunity to say anything meaningful about the orgy of violence she has created.  Only a few times, and in passing does Katniss question the authority overlords who created the Hunger Games.  Her narrative primarily focuses on overwrought, repeatative descriptions every event in the book as it occurs.  She spends the majority of the novel attempting to appease them.  The single most compelling scene in the novel is when Katniss and Peeta have the opportunity to commit suicide, and while their decision makes a statement about loyalty, it ultimately sends the message that you should give up instead of fight, and that you should bow to your oppressors if you feel there is any chance they will spare your life.  "Resistance is futile" seems to be Collins' message.  Other dystopian novels like Brave New World or Oryx and Crake, explore the machinations of a dysfunctional society, or like Lord of the Flies, demonstrate what can occur in the absence of society to place borders around the extremes of the unchecked drives of human nature.  Others, like 1984 explore the psychology of its protagonists.  Teenage readers should leave this novel to the smaller kiddos it was probably intended for, and skip ahead to more substantive (and enjoyable) books.
I heard about his trilogy for a while before I finally decided I would go ahead and order the first book to see how I liked it. I am a college student with little free time but I wanted to read this trilogy after all the recommendations. There is no denying that the way the book is written keeps you going back for more. In less than two days I had blazed through the first book, was driving to the bookstore to grab the second book, and once back at home, was online ordering the third. After I finished the trilogy, I felt so emotionally drained and I knew why. I m going to write my review as if the three books were one book since I had the fortune to read through them successively. Before I start, I have to say that I did thoroughly enjoy these books, there are just things I wish that could be different with it. A lot of issues with the book have already been discussed previously such as the rushing of the story line in the third book, the overuse of "drugging Katniss then explaining the missed events" trick etc. I wanted to touch upon a couple of thoughts I had in addition to those great reviews.  I was pretty intrigued by Katniss' character at first for many reasons, and starting out the book I really really wanted to like her. She seemed immature, complex, intense but deeply caring. I felt like there was a lot of room for character growth. As I read on, I began to dislike her more and more. Throughout the series, her immaturity never seems to wane. Her thoughts sound like that of a child, they are very self serving and arrogant. The reader slowly starts to learn that all her "heroic" actions throughout the trilogy are about making herself look good, or being able to live with herself. She also definitely has trust issues, no matter how much the lead male character confesses his love to her, puts his life on the life for her or even offers to die in her place, she is still so skeptical about his love for her....REALLY? What more does this poor guy need to do??  As for the love triangle in this book between Katniss, Gale and Peeta, it seems forced. I feel like the books could have stood on its own without it. The fact that Katniss and Peeta were thrown into an arena to kill each other was complicated enough. Gale's presence was fine, if the author had kept him as a "big brother" figure throughout the book which he played perfectly. Gale's character was not developed enough for the readers to really be rooting for him seeing as readers were so engrossed in what Katniss and Peeta were going through together.  Aside from the lack of character growth of Katniss, some characters were actually very likable. Prim, an innocent little sister who has a natural talent for healing people like her mother. It is only around Prim that Katniss remotely begins to resemble a real human being with real human feelings. Prim is selfless and very mature for her age, too bad the author had to kill her off for no good purpose. Then there is Rue, a little girl that Katniss meets in the arena who like Prim, is also intelligent,selfless, caring and innocent...guess what she gets killed too. So then there's Finnick who develops as a character beautifully. This apparently shallow, crude man turns out to be caring, deep, troubled and hopelessly in love with a mad girl. Hate to admit it, but at one point, I almost wished the story was told from their point of view because their love story was so beautiful and inspiring...buuuuttt you guessed, the author killed him off with no good purpose or contribution to the story line.  Then there is Peeta, what a great character, you cant help but like the guy and feel bad for him at the same time. It is hard not to feel bad for this poor guy who has fallen in love with the heroine with no feelings for others, and barely any redeeming qualities. Peeta's character and strength doesnt waiver from beginning to end and I think that is why he is so likable. He is pure, caring, selfless, humane and an advocate for everybody. He genuinely seems to care for all people. Peeta never becomes afraid or selfish in the face of death and shows an unbelievable amount of maturity and wisdom for being his age. His only weakness as a character? His constant, illogical submissiveness to Katniss.  I wish sooooo much that there could be another book, not a sequel to this trilogy but a book that runs concurrently with this trilogy, only narrated by Peeta. I m not sure if this has ever happened or if it would be an unprecedented event but I feel like that is what this trilogy needs. Peeta's emotional stability, complex yet humane character could give readers almost a completely different view on the whole event. If we could follow Peeta through the events that took place, through growing up, entering the games, winning them, going through the quarter quells, being taken hostage by the capitol, being brainwashed, rescued and finally being able to settle down with Katniss, I feel that readers would not only be able to appreciate Katniss and the entire situation more, but it would offer a more complete, less dark story and ending. There needs to be much more that happened and happens for the story to just end like that and hearing Peeta's side of it, would give readers a chance to just feel more complete.
I've heard about The Hunger Games over the last few years and resisted reading it for two reasons.  First, I hate depressing books.  I mean, they depress me for days, so generally I avoid this.  (This is the reason I'm not in my mother's book club.lol) Given the premise of the book I couldn't see ho it could be anything but totally depressing.  Second,  I was sure it could not live up to the hype.  So many people were waiting anxiously for the third book and talking about how good it was, I was sure that would be sorely disappointed when I finally setteled down to ready. I finally decided to read it because of the movie release.  Wanting to see the movie but knowing films never do complete justice to the written word, I decided I had to read it first.  Thankfully, all of my resons for resistance were completely wrong.  This book lived of to the hype, and then some.  While there were moments that almost had me in tears, the story was so fast paced that you as a reader couldn't wallow but had to keep up with Katniss.  The character development is amazing. Katniss was such a complex character, but you as a reader never have a hard time reconciling her complexity. To me that is the work of a wonderful author.  Katniss is smart, resourceful, caring, pragmatic,hopeful and practical. She manages as a survivor not to worry about things down the road, but focuses on the moment, while keeping the bigger picture in mind.  And all of the characters surrounding Katniss help to give us the full picture of the girl. In fact, all of the characters in this book are multi-dimensional.  Ms. Collins has created a 3-D futuristic world that any reader would love to dive into.  I can only hope that the movie does a good job of recreating it.

I started The Hunger Games in the evening. Eight hours later, I finally summoned one small spark of the courage of its heroine and stopped with a quarter of the book left! As soon as I awoke a few hours later, I checked the condition of my burns and cuts and was surprised to find that they had healed. No, that wasn't it; those things had only happened to characters in a book.  The Hunger Games film-release buzz intrigued me enough to dive into the book before visiting the theater. I had previously only heard superficial mentions of a dark, brutal story and did not become interested until some of the advance film reviews suggested that the story might actually convey significant and thoughtful content in an action package. It does.  This is a fresh addition to the list of classic dystopian dramatic critiques of the state that work by showing what the state does to society and human beings in a magnified, allegorical form. The author's choice of a close first-person voice and sympathetic main character transform the central state's artificial battle game show into a very human landscape in the context of a post-apocalyptic North America. The nature of zero-sum game-making is revealed through a specific set of living eyes.  Katniss has been a part-time hunter and gatherer from early childhood. In a starving coal district, she became the sole provider for her unstable mother and younger sister after her father's death in a mine explosion. She supports her family by recalling her father's lessons and becoming an illegal hunter in the forest outside the dilapidated District-12 security fence. Officials avoid arresting or shooting her or Gale, her hunting partner, because the officials themselves enjoy buying wild game, vegetables, berries, and herbal products from them.  Katniss and Gale find a small frontier of liberty in the forest outside the state's fence and a thriving black market inside it. Outside the fence is also the only place they can speak their true thoughts about their district's poverty and the injustice of the center's rule. The relative ease of honesty and authenticity in private and the necessity of being fake and false under surveillance is a recurring theme.  She inevitably ends up in the games. Why do players in the Hunger Games not just join together and refuse to fight? The state's experienced "Game Makers" have carefully considered and adjusted for this over the years. For example, they build into the vast land reserve selected as each year's "arena" certain prepared unnatural disasters they can trigger if things get too boring for the viewing audience. Players are also uncertain just how much of the arena environment is really natural. What they do know is that too long a stalemate or too much productive cooperation will lead the Game Makers to cause elements of this environment to start injuring or killing players, ruling out long-term survival for more than one.  Suzanne Collins  I found in this a telling allegory. The state's Game Makers are working not to solve the zero-sum dilemma of game theory, but to make sure that win/win cooperation is sufficiently forbidden that a zero-sum game remains the only option. The game is carefully rigged to stifle natural human cooperation and maintain artificial conflict. Thus, the people, both in the game and in their home districts, are left with less time, energy, or opportunity to turn their attention to standing side-by-side and perceiving their true common enemies -- those who set them up to play their life roles under constructed zero-sum terms.  This book succeeds stunningly in its dramatic structure, brevity, and execution. Perhaps the "young adult" rubric has even aided in omitting the unnecessary and focusing squarely on story. As it turns out, though, these are the hallmarks of any good book and here we find a level of content, theme, and execution that should by no means be considered suitable only for a teen audience. To be precise, I think the book is easily interesting enough for adults, even those with only slight sci-fi leanings, though unsuitable for younger children who lack the tools needed for healthy digestion of such complex and intense material.  Futuristic technical and biotech science-fiction elements, including a range of bioweapon species called "muttations" still living decades after their use in the war, are generally believably rendered and add texture without upstaging human drama. The socio-political situation presented is on the simplistic side, but seems sufficient to do its core job of supporting the story. Besides, we are only seeing first-person through the young character's eyes based on her limited information about the wider world she inhabits. This makes the amount of socio-political detail that readers see realistic from her viewpoint.  This story encourages questioning and acts of humanity even in the face of the zero-sum games the state tries to limit us to on various kinds of battlefields, both metaphorical and real. Few more important core messages can be smuggled to young people -- or anyone else. This book can encourage us to look beyond artificial win/lose and lose/lose games and create cooperative win/win person-to-person relationships that reestablish islands of truth and rightness within whatever enclaves we might manage to construct against dystopian backdrops.
I had recognized Collins from a previous series, "Gregor the Overlander," and was frankly expecting more of the same. Well, nah, that impression was banished when I read the book. She had improved, streamlining her writing and nuancing her 'teenager' archetype to a more believable... teenager. She kept the themes of stress and protection in times of war, but rearranged it to a somehow more fantastic but less cartoony portrayal of a dystopian world.  I don't think Hunger Games is a social commentary, or focused on violence. It's a story about revolution. Interestingly, it does not tell you what to think about this. The writing is called 'compelling' because it rockets you through the book, easy to read but not really that impressive prose-wise. Keeping nicely within the confines of the rough character Katniss, you discover the world of Panem and it's glamorous, cruel Capitol from a biased viewpoint that seems authentic even if it's sometimes annoying.  Katniss, as a character, is cynical. Katniss will do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means pandering to the Capitol's wishes. If she fails, or protests, she will die, her family will die, her entire district will suffer in her place. Panem is a totalitarian trap. Good enough premise.  The Hunger Games narrative style makes no effort to explain itself and bluntly moves on without reflection. It was nice to have the author not spelling out the morals of her story, and it allowed me free reign to picture every scenario and build my curiosity of the world as opposed to, having the author shove his/her ideological lessons down my throat.  The subplot of romance between Peeta and Katniss is awkwardly and painfully executed, though I can see the idea she was trying to execute. She pulls through on pure plot desperation and guts alone to be honest. Luckily, romance is subplot and subplot only.  The buildup and execution of the Revolution is one of the most efficient I've ever seen in a book series. The buildup is slow enough to not seem convenient, it takes on an ambitious project of showing (not telling) what it takes to start and end a war, and that includes nixing some happy endings.  Hunger Games is a pretty neat story with cool characters and decent writing. It is very compelling! What's not to like?  Well, actually, the prose wasn't all that engaging, but it was a mature, developed style though simplistic. I also have issues with how some Arena rules aren't really explored or how Katniss doesn't have to face the dilemma of killing Rue, for example. But besides that, I mean, it's way better than the usual fare and completely immersed me in her world. The book set out what it wanted to do, and I'm not going to nitpick about pandering to my interests.
The premise of The Hunger Games is not entirely original.  It's evocative of The Lottery, The Running Man, and our nation's lifelong identification with Rome.  It's a well worn premise, but one that is well worn because it can be so very effective.  And in Collins's hands it is just that.  The Hunger Games takes place in a dystopian future in Panem, a country consisting of a metropolitan Capitol and twelve outlying districts in what used to be the U.S.  In retribution for a previous rebellion, once a year one boy and girl between the ages of 12-18 from each district is selected by lottery to compete in a televised, possibly weeks-long battle to the death while the nation is forced to watch.  District 12, coal mining country, is the poorest of the districts and has historically performed poorly in the games (I can't help but think of the Battle of King's Mountain and the Battle of Matewan, but I guess they don't cover those in Panem history).  The Hunger Games is never preachy.  Collins paints us a picture of life in Panem and the Games and leaves us to draw our own conclusions.  It's a welcome respect for the reader; we shouldn't need to be told anymore than we are to recognize the brutality and cruelty of the Capitol; the psychological torture of the Games, not just on the participants but on the residents of each District; and the prurient voyeurism of the Games.  Collins slowly peels back the layers on Katniss's world as the story progresses, each time showing another ugly side to it and exposing another lie.  Collins accomplishes the difficult task of making Katniss feel like a real teenager without turning her into a whiny brat or something akin to a personality-less, bland, pair of pants we can comfortably slip into.  The romance angle of the book works not because it examines rich, fully realized adult love, but because it does not.  Rather, it examines the awkward, half-formed adolescent version of love.  Which is probably harder to pull off than the former, but I think Collins pulls it off quite well; especially considering it's a subject in which I have no particular interest.  The Hunger Games is written entirely in the first person.  I found it a bit off-putting at first, and there is little you can do with first person you can't do with a single POV third person limited.  But it works.  In particular, the first person makes Katniss telling us the nuts and bolts of the games in a very clinical fashion less boring than terrifying.  Katniss doesn't think about the broader implications of the society she lives in anymore than any other teenager would, allowing the reader to connect the lines himself.  It does have the disadvantage that we don't see what is happening back in District 12 or outside the arena in general (which I understand the movie remedies).  The Hunger Games is marketed as a YA book, and it is an extremely quick and easy read, but it is also an example of speculative fiction at its best, delving into the recesses of human nature.
Told from the perspective of the main character, Katniss, THE HUNGER GAMES takes place in a future where the United States as we know it no longer exists. The book never explains exactly what happened, but years earlier there was some sort of economic collapse and global catastrophe. In the aftermath, what was once the continent of North America is now a country called Panem. In what is explained in THE HUNGER GAMES, Panem was controlled by a massive Capitol City that ruled over thirteen separate districts. The disparity between the Capitol and the Districts was so great that the Districts rebelled. As a result of the civil war that followed, District Thirteen was destroyed. Each year from that point forward, a male and female child between the ages of 12-18 is selected by lottery to take part in The Hunger Games, a massive event where the participants were forced to fight to the death until only one person remains.  When her younger sister, Prim, is selected as the tribute for District Twelve, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is joined by Peeta Mellark, the son of the local baker. The two soon become almost inseparable and become two of the stars of one of the most unusual Hunger Games ever.  I really enjoyed THE HUNGER GAMES. The book has echoes of the Greek myths of Theseus and the Labyrinth, but it also reminded me of Stephen King's THE LONG WALK. However, despite these influences, THE HUNGER GAMES is a new and exciting work. It's over three-hundred pages long, but is an incredibly quick read. It's a page-turner that is difficult to put down. It's a book full of relevant themes for our times, but deals with these issues in ways that young adults can comprehend and understand.  Also, the story has a little something for everyone: it's not just an action story, it's not just a romance, it's not just a dramatic piece of literature. It contains elements of all those things. Lastly, it features a female heroine who truly is someone girls can look up to. There aren't very many great pieces of fiction that feature such a strong, moral, upstanding, and courageous young woman as the protagonist.  Overall, THE HUNGER GAMES is an exciting story with elements of several different genres. It features a strong female as the protagonist. Though the book ends on a note of conflict, it sets things up for future volumes.
The Hunger Games gives us a very interesting glimpse into another world that could one day become our own. It is a dystopian Young Adult novel written in first person. Katniss, our heroine and narrator, dreads the Reaping every year. Living in the Seam all her life, she knows what hunger is and how horrible it can be to go without food. She breaks the rules though and hunts outside of the fence with her friend Gale. Both Kantiss and Gale have more than the required entry put into the Reaping every year because they need to get the food that extra entries give them. Their families depend on them to do so.  This is the first Reaping that Katniss' younger sister, Prim, has to take a part in. At the age of twelve you get one entry into the Reaping to be chosen for the Hunger Games. There are twelve districts on Panem that take part in these games, each has two tributes- a male and female. When you turn twelve it is the first year that you have a mandatory entry into the Reaping, but you can also opt for extra entries for grain and oil to last you for the year.  The worst thing in the world happens though at this year's Reaping ceremony. Prim has been chosen randomly out of the thousands of entries. Katniss obviously does not want this at all, so she volunteers herself and pushes Prim out of the way. Our other tribute, Peeta, has been chosen as well. And here we start the journey into the Hunger Games itself...  I really enjoyed this book. I didn't think I was going to enjoy it as much as I did. Dystopian novels are really becoming very popular, and because of that a lot of ideas are not as original. Although, don't get me wrong here, I love a good dystopian novel. Thankfully The Hunger Games was one, it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! I was more than sucked into this book, and did not want to put it down for one second!  The idea of taking two children from twelve different districts and pitting them against each other to the death was disturbing, but oddly fascinating at the same time. Collins does a great job at letting us look into the life of Katniss and we really get to figure out what she's all about. She is a very honorable and strong heroine, which I appreciate. I love strong women in my books, and it just makes this read even better!  There were many characters in this book that I fell in love with. I love Katniss for one, mostly because she's bad-ass. I also really loved Rue, she was so small and faerie like! Out of the boy tributes I really did enjoy Peeta, even though he was clueless with quite a few things.  Collins paints a very vivid environment that the tributes have to survive in. The animals that were made by the government in this book are very imaginative but also realistic. The mockingjay for instance, I could totally see that. Take a bird that sings really well, and mutate it so that it picks up on human words and songs. There you go, you have your very own spy!  Overall this book was very interesting, and I loved it! I can't wait to see the movie, and I also can't wait for my copy of Catching Fire to show up so I can continue the trilogy!
The Hunger Games was an easy book to get into, despite feeling a little bit disoriented, trying to figure out what "harvest day" meant and such, but there wasn't a bit of boringness to be had. Katniss Everdeen is a complex character that I was never able to totally love, but she enthralled me and made me listen to her story. Haymitch says it best when he tells Katniss she has the "appeal of a slug." Still, despite obviously not being a charismatic character, there is something about Katniss that draws the reader in and gets them stuck in this world of Panem. I assume anyone brought up in such circumstances would make you want to take a few steps backwards when meeting them. One character that I genuinely  loved was Haymitch Abernathy. I absolutely adored his snarky commentary and the comical scenes he's in. I also liked a few of Gale's lines in the beginning, though I can't say I totally fell for him as so many others did.  Also, I totally loved the ending of the book. Perfect.  One final note on the what I loved section. Those of you who have read most of my reviews may have caught onto a certain masochistic tendency to my reading tastes. I love books that infuriate me. I love books that jerk my emotions from one extreme to another. The Hunger Games is no exception to this rule. Shortly after I found out just what the Hunger Games are, and definitely as I read The Hunger Games, I was totally consumed by a hate for the government of Panem. I could barely breathe through my teeth that any society-fictional or not- would do such a thing to it's citizens. And while it doesn't effect me personally in the United States, the truth is that, while not to the same extent as the Hunger Games takes it, children's lives are sacrificed all the time in other countries without a thought. This thought ate at me. And, by some weird twist of brain chemistry, caused me to have to read the rest of the series.  Despite the characters being at a distance to me, this book is still phenomenal. And again, I think that when you look at the world in which The Hunger Games takes place, it's completely understanding why the characters would seem so distant. I can't quite explain why this is, but The Hunger Games is definitely in my "top favorite books" list. The story itself is completely consuming, especially after the Hunger Games have started. If you are one of the few who have yet to read The Hunger Games, I highly advise getting ahold of it and reading Katniss's story for yourself
No doubt about it, the book is dark with a disturbing premise. The story is a compelling, must-keep-page-turning narration of a girl in a brutal society forced into their equivalent of the Coliseum spectacles of ancient Rome. The themes in The Hunger Games may be emotionally overwhelming for younger children to process, I would not recommend it for any child under 13.  The story is told from the perspective of the female protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. Strong, emotionally numb, resourceful, clumsy with relationships, protective, intelligent and undereducated - a fascinating mix of broken girl and heroine. Rich and compelling, I particularly enjoyed that Collins never broke out into eloquent descriptive prose because the person telling us the story was not a degree-holding English major - she was a serf from district 12 trying to survive. Before the reaping she dreams of living outside of the Capitol's influence, afterwards she dreams of just not looking pathetic when she is killed in the games.  Superbly written with something for everyone: action; love story; despair; sorrow; joy; resignation and triumph - it's an emotional roller-coaster that cruelly leaves you hanging at the end (not to worry, the sequel is right here!).  The most disturbing aspect of the story was the manifest injustice of Panem society. Strongly resembling that of ancient Sparta, the Panem Capitol, a less populous but technologically superior district, defeated all other districts and put them into a condition of semi-slavery similar to how the Spartans defeated the more populous Messenians and instituted Helotism. The Capitol keeps order by disarming the districts and treating law breakers or any hint of rebellion with beatings and executions just as the Spartans did to the Helots. It's painful at times to read the book and imagine living as Katniss does in such a society, yet we know these societies have existed before for centuries at a time.
The Hunger Games is a book about the effect of war on kids. The reviewers who did not like this book, really could not relate to the plot or the main character, Katniss.  The plot is brutal and the character is at times very mature, and at other times, selfish and childish.  The negative reviews touched on the stories implausible points, such as 1. the games themselves and how "parents would not stand for it." 2. the main characters only slight reaction to killings she instigates, and 3. the main character's being unlikable, distant and selfish.    Katniss disconnects her emotions early, when she must be a parent to her parent. When she must avert starvation for her family.  That early abuse leads to her doing everything she can for survival, including a disconnect of her conscience as she must kill or be killed.  It also leads to her disfunctional romantic relationships, as well as her erratic behavior. She is survival itself. She is constantly confused as to if she is a child or an adult, the line blurs. I believe the author does not want you to like her, but understand the terrible, irreversible effects of war on children. How it removes their childhood and makes them into emotionless, disconnected individuals.  Katniss's childhood is taken away, she buries her feelings deep down, and is basically very very screwed up.  It is the authors' intent to show that terrible effect war has: robbing Katniss of her childhood, family, emotions, identity and choices. If she reacts to each killing, she must connect them to her emotions and risk completely going mad.  There is only so much a child's brain can take. She regresses occasionally, only because she did not fully experience her childhood.  As for the "parents not standing for the games," I believe they would if controlled by fear. History is full of genocides and terrible atrocities where people turned a blind eye.  Fear is a powerful motive.  This is a well written fantasy.  It has a purpose of showing the terrible effects of how fear controls and how war destroys all people. Young adult fiction, but I enjoyed these books. Recommended.
SEMI-SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!  This is the story of Katniss Everdeen. She lives in a new world called Panem that was created from the ashes of the former continent of North America. Due to a rebellion that once happened in Panem, the country's government has decided to punish the people by forcing the 12 remaining districts to offer up "tribute" one male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 for the annual "Hunger Games" which is an arena battle to the death. The boy tribute from District 12 is Peeta Mellark.  At the very beginning of the story, Katniss was not supposed to be tribute. Her sister, who is in the drawing for the first time, with only one slip in there gets picked. Katniss, who cannot bear to see her sister go, volunteers as tribute. The rest of the story follows the journey to the Hunger Games, and the Hunger Games themselves.  A romance seems to begin to blossom between Peeta and Katniss, and the Gamemakers even announce that a new rule was introduced, and that if the male and female pair from any give district is still in the games, they will both be able to be crowned Victors. At the end however, the Gamemakers renounce this rule, hoping for a massively amazing ending. Katniss comes up with a plan to thwart them however, and therefore she and Peeta are both named Victor.  Now there is massive danger for Katniss and Peeta since the government is not happy with this fit of rebellion. Katniss is going to have to start watching her every move and thought and word in hopes that she does not provoke the government into taking action against her. This is where book one leaves off, and I almost screamed in frustration. I will not be able to get book two for a little while, and I'm itching to read it.  All in all this book is amazing. It was super hard to put down, and I hung on to every word. It's packed with action, and a little bit of romance, and it's just an all around amazing book. I think that everyone needs to read this book at least once in their lives, and it will in truth teach you a little bit about yourself that you may have not known.
When I read the book summary, I wasn't sure if this book was really for me. It sounded a bit too science fiction for my normal tastes. I decided to give it a try anyway and was completely blown away. I couldn't put it down, and when I absolutely had to stop reading (life does intrude on precious reading time) I couldn't stop thinking about my new character friends. I was completely drawn into this new world created and couldn't wait to get back to it. I devoured it in no time, and immediatly started to second.  Katniss is a real heroine, and her struggle draws you in completely as you take every step with her and fight to keep her alive in the games. I found myself shouting out loud at the characters as events turned and the suspense heightened. I flew through the pages and felt an adrenaline rush through all the twists and turns of every challenge that Katniss endured. I cheered with every victory and was nearly in tears with every loss. (My Husband was very puzzled and thought I had lost my mind).  I was completely sucked into a world where 12 districts most on the brink of starvation, were forced to sacrifice their children year after year for the entertainment of the capital. Like fights between the gladiators in ancient Rome, 24 contestants all under than age of 18 and forced to fight to the death until only one tribute remains. The viewers from the capital watch anxiously awaiting each bloodbath relishing in the violence of each kill, completely desensitized to the fact that these are real children dying. Most of these kids have never weilded a weapon, and instead have spent their entire lives working to provide foods and goods for the capital. And now they have to fight for survival all with the hope that if they indeed win, the will be able to provide food for their starving district for a year. Katniss is not your normal damsel in distress just waiting for the hot boy to fall in love with her then come save her. She is strong and talented and actually does much of the saving herself. She is opinionated, and stands up for herself in a world where such definace is completely forbidden. She is the kind of character you love and want to relate to. You want her to succeed, although it is obvious that her chances of that are impossible.  This book combines love, heartbreak, action, suspense, and surprises around every page. It is a story unlike any other out there. It turned all of my preconcieved notions about YA books completely upside down. I was addicted from the very beginning, and my addiction did not stop until I had finished the trilogy!  Absolutely amazing.
It's not often that a writer of fiction can so accurately measure the pulse of the human condition. Suzanne Collins has brilliantly done just that in  "The Hunger Games".  What is it about the human condition that draws us to live vicariously through the exploits of others? To live as spectators instead of participants? Why do we shrink into the shadows, afraid of standing out yet celebrate and at the same time despise those who do stand out - who take the hero's journey? Do we recognize our own fear; our own hypocrisy? We find ourselves wanting; hungry for fulfillment. Not just of the belly but more of the spirit and the soul.  Some who suffer discover that alongside depravity and ignorance lies beauty and light. With this discovery is the yearning to be free - not so much from our outer circumstances but more from our inner prison. The hero's journey is the discovery of what it means to be real.  The soulless ones (as represented by those in The Capital) hunger the most for fulfillment and meaning. Their answer is to set themselves up as gods; separate and special from the rest. Lacking an internal compass, they seek to manipulate and control others. Their illusion of power and control mask their fear of those who are truly free. Theirs is an artificial existence covered over with makeup and trendy styles. Their precarious position depends on others living in fear. So they erect their electrified fences, track our movements with their cameras and monitor our conversations. They sacrifice our children to their wars and employ enforcers to keep the mob under control. Still, some do break the rules and escape into the wilderness and discover there is a different reality. There are times, in order to be true to one's self, we must take a stand. We break through the artificial restraints and discover there are things worth living for. ...and dying for. Until we find fulfillment we hunger. We play games.  Read the book. You will not be disappointed. You will hunger for more.
I feel like I'm probably the last person in the world to read The Hunger Games. I have to admit that I just wasn't interested in it by seeing the cover. I know that's shallow, but to me it looked like a "man book". Not that the cover wasn't a good cover, there was just nothing feminine about it. I'm sure I don't even have to go over the premise with you all. If you haven't read it, then you've probably at least heard all about it. I've seen other book bloggers talk about this book for what seems like ages now, so my interest slowly raised. When I saw everything about the movie opening up this month, I decided that I ought to give it a try - and I'm glad I did.  It was a wonderfully written book filled with lots of descriptions of the time period. I did, however, think that the book had a lot of slow parts - especially toward the beginning. That's the main reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5. This dystopian book had a great premise, but I'm not exactly sure why the government was the way that it was. Maybe I will find out more about that in the other books.  The characterization in this book is great. You get to start feeling attached to so many of the characters. Katniss is a courageous girl who makes an awesome heroine. There are two great guys who have the potential to be a love interest. I really came to like Peeta, but I'd really like to see Katniss with Gale. Though, to be honest, my moms' name is Gale so that does weird me out a little bit. Speaking of names, almost all the names in this book are unusual.  This is not a fluffy, easy-reading type of book. These are very emotional times for these characters. The horrors they go through are unimaginable. It definitely makes you grateful for the things that you do have.
The thing I didn't like about The Hunger Games is I don't own the next book.  : (  There are some spoilers in the review below so read at your own risk.  I expected to like this book, as I tend to enjoy the genre, but I was surprised by how caught up I was in the book and the characters, it was actually a page turner, unlike a lot of things I have read lately.  I loved the book. The author kept such a good pace, which can be hard with a book that has so many small and HUGE moments.  The characters were believably likeable and dislikeable.  And just as if this book was written by Joss Whedon himself, my favorite character died. Though I guess you should never fall for a character that is a contestant in the hunger games.  For a plot that is not original in the least, the author does a great job of keeping it fresh and making parts of it her own.  She does a great job describing the surroundings and the world the story takes place in but at the same time doesn't bog you down with imagery.  I love the characters she created, even the ones I didn't like.  Peeta is a great guy without being perfect. Katniss is wonderfully skilled and caring but has major emotional issues.  Prim seems helpless at first but when you hear about the way she can heal and stand by people when they look, and smell, the worst, it gave me a whole new way of looking at her.  Rue's death ripped me in two. I mean I saw it coming: 1) It is the Hunger Games, people go there to die, 2) Katniss was getting too comfortable with having Rue around, and 3) Kat needed a catalyst to really get her head in the games.  I loved and ached that Rue screams out to Kat and she responds and kills the career without a hesitation, and that later you can tell she is still human  because she feels bad that she killed someone.  On that note, I am glad that Kat kills someone (besides just with the tracker jackers), it would have been unbelievable that she would have made it through the whole game without it. I felt it was more real.  The fear I have for Kat and Peeta now with the Capitol closely watching them is great.  I actually worry for them, which considering they are fictional...Go you Suzanne Collins, go you.  In short, good writing, fabulous pace, and wonderfully flushed out and believable characters (even the side ones) makes me no longer wonder how this book series took off. I book worth talking about.
Hey I'm reviewing that book that everyone has already read.  It's the number one book on Amazon right now and it's sure to stay there until Ronos Part I: Catalyst comes out later this year. I bet you're dying to know what I think about The Hunger Games.  Since everyone has already read this there are going to be some major SPOILERS throughout this review.  There were things about it that I liked and there were things about it that I didn't like (Duh!).  If you don't know me then I should tell you that I'm very critical of things that a ton of people like.  I hold those books/movies/TV shows to a higher standard than others.  As a result it often seems like I hate the things that everyone else loves.  I didn't love The Hunger Games.  Please don't judge me.  Does it help if I tell you that I didn't hate it either?  There were a lot of good things about it.  I love the setting of the world.  The country being set up into districts and being run by the capital was cool for me and I was a little jealous of the authors ingenuity.  By having the POV character not knowledgable about the other districts meant she didn't have to have pages and pages about exposition about what the major industries and cultures of the districts were.  Also, if she needed to change anything for the sake of the story she could just pretend like the protagonist was misinformed about what she knew.  It's a good writing strategy.  We got to know a lot about district 12 and very little about any of the others.  That left a lot of mystery and intrigue to the world of the story.  The setting alone was interesting enough to keep reading.  I think that along with the setting goes the sweet story setup for why the districts are the way they are.  The Capital runs everything everyone does to remind them about how all powerful the government is.  Just in case that isn't enough each district is also to send two kids to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games.  Twenty-four teenagers and kids trying to kill each other; the last won standing wins. That's cool.  Sure to bring an appropriate amount of antagonism to the story.  The main character is Katniss Everdeen and she volunteers for The Hunger Games so that her little sister doesn't have to fight.  Katniss is a solid protagonist.  She does a lot of thinking.  Lots of the story beats take place in her head (which is why the movie is going to be lacking compared to the book) especially in the first book.  Most of the in her head stuff is about her relationship with Peeta (who has a terrible name).  Which leads to the weakest thing about this book and the entire trilogy.  Peeta and the love story is straight up annoying.  Suzanne Collins is a good writer.  She knows how to describe things in a unique way and there was never a moment where I thought she wasn't trying to do a good job, except for this cheezy love story.  Now I'm not one of those guys who is automatically opposed to any love story in everything.  I enjoy anything that is well written.  I'm saying that the love story feels so out of place with The Hunger Games story. I can see what they were going for.  They wanted someone in the games that was going to be very hard for Katniss to kill.  That's a good idea.  But the way they do it is no good.  And there is a reason I'm saying they instead of her, the author.  The way it reads it almost feels like she doesn't know how to write those drenched in love lines that Peeta constantly rolls out.  She is so good everywhere else in the book why does she falter when talking about how much Peeta is in love with Katniss.  Most of what he says feels like a cliché.  So I'm saying they because it reads like that was something the publisher told her to include in a rewrite because for some reason in every young adult fiction the lead girl has to make a choice between two guys who both love her more than any teenager has ever loved anyone.  The choice plot is now a cliché, not a convention.  Please stop boring me.  The choice plot makes me upset because it's used as the climax of the first book.  That made me so mad I decided I wouldn't read the other ones.  There was no way that's supposed to be the climax of book one.  I changed my mind a few months later and read the second one where I found the real climax for book one.  It's the conversation Katniss had with President Snow in case you are wondering and it needs to be included in the first movie if you want to do it right.  The games themselves were entertaining enough but they could have been better.  All the things I didn't like Collins improved for the second book.  I didn't like the supplies they needed dropping in exactly when they needed them.  It was kind of explained but not well enough.  It was a little Dues ex machina and was a lazy way to move the story forward.  The best stuff of the actual Hunger Games was between Katniss and Rue. It was sad when that ended because then I knew it would go back to that lame love story.  One last thing.  For a story about kids killing each other until there is only one left standing the climax in the arena was pretty anticlimactic.  I guess in the back of my mind I knew that there were two more books and that Katniss and Peeta had to survive.  There's nothing wrong with that but one of the principles of story telling is giving the audience what they want but not in the way they want.  There was never really a moment where I was excited about what was going to happen next.  It was always just Katniss and Peeta killing everyone else.  My interest spiked a little when it was down to just the two of them but it should have been spiking a lot higher for where I was in the book.  A lot of the things I didn't like about this book might sound kind of petty and most people don't care about them.  It's still a good enough book and I still think you should read it if you have nothing better to read.  By the way if you do have something better to read let me know what it is.  We got an Amazon gift card for our wedding and we love reading things that are awesome.  Put your suggestions in the comments.
This review is based on The Trilogy of The Hunger Games.  I decided to read "The Hunger Games" after realizing it was so popular that a movie was being released in a few weeks.  I've always preferred books over movies, and I know my husband would drag me to see the movie even before me having the opportunity tor read the book.  I love the Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer (absolutely every book and still crave more).  Young adult books usually don't interest me, but as I said I knew I couldn't resist knowing what I was going to get myself into.  Book 1-  I couldn't put it down from the first page.  I was absolutely taken with Katniss and Gale.  I knew it took place in the future and it would be a "difficult to handle" read.  Maybe I just have a strong stomach or don't find what occurred in the book that depressing.  While it did spawn some deep emotion, I felt that the characters all represented what they had to do to survive in that time period.  Some reviewers said they wouldn't allow their daughters to read it, as they didn't want their child emulating Katniss.  Katniss is in the future and has to fend for food in the wild, then play a game to kill other children.  I don't see that kind of game being required anytime soon.  Besides, aren't our children killing each other already? This is a work of fiction and should be taken as such.  It started out exciting, knowing that the games would soon begin. The elaborate costumes, the presentation of the tributes, and the parade down the streets of the Capitol.  Collins did an awesome job going through detail, but not so much so that I felt it dragged on and wanted a break.  I read this book in less than two days, and I was craving more.  It reminded me of Lord of the Flies, Romeo and Juliet, and Twilight all in one book.  Book 2-  Obviously with the ending in Book 1, I couldn't help but want to continue reading on.  What I thought was about nothing but suspense and a little about love turned out to be nothing but about love.  A love between teenagers in the future, where it seems we go back in time to when it was considered acceptable to be in love at that age and know exactly what is wanted out of life.  I knew I was losing interest when I put the book down and started looking for something else to read.  I decided to finish the book, how bad could the ending be?  It was interesting, although at times I thought to myself why in the world am I subjecting myself to another love story about characters that in reality could never exist.  Book 3-  The book drags on as there are uprisings in the districts.  Again we find the main character, Katniss in love with two boys. (sound familiar, Twilight fans?)  She has to decide to become a leader, decide whom she really needs and loves, and who she intends to spend the rest of her life with.  That's a  lot to take in for being only seventeen.  Again, the thought of Twilight pops back in my head and I think to myself... STOP.  Ok, I finish the story which has an okay and believable ending.  It wasn't a waste of my time.  Three days and The Trilogy was overwith.  I guess now I don't mind subjecting myself to the movie, even though I'm sure I'll be reminded of all my other favorite books thrown into one.  I recommend this book to ages 16 and up.  Girls are impressionable, but need to realize that they have the rest of their life to decide what to do with it.  Oh, I didn't cry. Even though I can be very emotional when it comes to literature.  It was all a means of survival and love.  No where near what other other reviewers said about blood and gore.
First i will address other reviews the books talks about  in the first one how they are escorted by peacekeeper as if they are going to run or if family tries to intervene and remember the people running from the capital to district 13 got killed here had to be a spark of rebellion large enough and if you look at the world the most successful country is totalitarian (China) and fascism is something that has indenture being torn down time after time thus it is not an illogical story line plus it is build on her experiences as a child going to battle sites and one of the thing she took interest in Greek mythology the tributes sent to the labyrinth and they are children so teen can relate and feel empathy and the fact that she is self-centered look at your children and you will probably see the same thing trust me i am at that age unlike you i don't have the bias of perfect angels  we (including myself)look at a situations to see how we can get by without doing any work or how we can benefit we live as if everyone is a tool  thus the book is written as if Katniss was a typical teen and gale is her childhood friend she has a deep connection with him while Peeta she feel for but thought that it was all an act or at least at first that is what she thought but then she can't choose how would you pick the boy who saved your life twice or the one who is so much like you and you have known forever but i am now going to talk about my experience with the book the first chapter was hard for me but then i couldn't put it down and was ready to pull my out waiting for the next one    p.s. i know that someone will take offense to thus but it is my honest option and i would love feed back besides the fact it is poorly written review i am to tired to care right now but after reading all the comments saying it is unrealistic and casting Kat in a negative light you aren't supposed to love her all the time even she hates herself most of the time but in the end she losses so much and she does develop as a human but not in the way you wanted she see the world as it is bitter and unforgiving if you want to give a comment on this but do not ant the world to see it email m,e at jbattiest@gmail.com with subject hunger games review
With all the hype surrounding the upcoming Hunger Games film; it was time to crack open the first book of the series and have a gander. To say that I had high expectations going into this book was certainly true, but casting that aside, and the fact that I avoided plot summaries (which I hope not to provide here) and spoilers, I wanted to go into this fresh, with no outward stimuli to influence my opinion. However, in my haste I recall an episode of the Library Police Podcast, hosted by Dietrich Stogner and Josh Mauthe where they dished about this series. Had I listened? Yes, but in all honesty, I could not recall a single word uttered on the episode. Feigning all other mental inventories of spoiling gremlins, I proceeded.  From the beginning of the book, we are introduced to the culture of Panem and it's overpowering government that rules with totality. The way it unfolds, through the first person narration of the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is unique, and often feels like it's fresh, not unexplored but just inexperienced. And really, Katniss is inexperienced in playing the Hunger Games, seeing as how you only play it once, and more often than not you die doing it. Katniss has the misfortune of being from District 12, which focuses on mining coal, and also hasn't won a Hunger Games in approximately 24years. That winner, Haymitch Abernathy, the mentor of Katniss and her fellow male tribute Peeta Mellark, is the towns most infamous citizen, aside from it's mayor, but is also the towns best drunk.  One of this book's strongest factors is the mythology it has built into itself. While it's not quite as detailed as say Harry Potter (it's also not as long a series either), it still puts on a clinic as to how to build a great world. Throughout the book, Katniss gives us a great explanation of how Panem is structured, why it's structured that way, the significance of the Hunger Games, all the little details before, during, and after the Games, and what makes certain districts distinct.  More stunning is this book's influences, and while it's hard to pin down exactly what this book is similar to, Battle Royale comes closest, but even that film deviates in ways from this sprawling epic. At the very beginning of the book, one can feel a touch of Shirley Jackson's short masterpiece "The Lottery." The Games recall to mind a story I remember reading in high school called "The Worlds Most Dangerous Game"; in which the hunt for human flesh replaces the hunt for big game in the safari's of Africa. I also feel like there is a strong element of the reality TV show Survivor in this book. A more dangerous version of it for sure, but that influence comes through, especially with the way the games are televised. This final reference may seem out of place to some, but I feel it must be mentioned. There are elements of a beauty pageant present in this novel; there is an interview that all tributes must do, along with a talent portion displayed to the gamemakers, and image is definitely how you win crowds and sponsors over in this book.  Only being one book into this trilogy, I'm starving for more. Particularly, in the last few chapters, Collins does a great job building tension in such a way, not knowing what will come next. After all, the 74th annual games were very controversial, especially the outcome. These results will lead to an unpredictability going into the next two books, and from my perspective will hopefully live up to this strong first book.  Stray Observations  There are a couple of things I didn't like in this book: There are a few moments late in the book where Katniss ponders on winning the games and being rich, she distinctly says, long after she lost hearing in one of her ears that "I'll pay someone to hear for me." The attitude doesn't really fit her character and kind of had me scratching my head a couple of times.  Secondly, I wish we knew a little bit more about each district, even if it's just a tiny explanation.  Wish there was a map of Panem.  I like that the protagonist is a strong woman, and the only man she has in her life is a bit inadequate.  Rue Dying = Me Crying  There is this great undercurrent in the Games, whereas, yes it is entertainment, but is barbaric in nature. Panem is obviously a bit more advanced than the country we live in now, and they choose to have it's competitors play these games in a barbaric manner, with primitive weapons, surviving in the wilderness (arena).  The themes are very relatable to now; totalitarianism, poverty, starvation, technology, war.  The romance (if you want to call it that) is so well done here; in other words, take notes Meyer.
I loved this book despite a few dissonances of plot development.  I stayed up late several nights in a row to finish it in a few days.  It is very exciting, and I teared up in spots.  I loved the Mutts, the tracker jackers, and especially the mockingjays.  Rue captured my heart. Maybe the Book Moguls have designated this as a YA entry, but I'd recommend it to all ages. Plus, omg, Capitol can control the weather!  Caesar, Flavius, Venia, Octavia, Cinna, Portia - Let me do a wild leap of logic and guess there is an ancient Roman Empire tie-in.  This also indicates: Capitol-Rome; Hunger Games-Gladiator Games; Punic War-Panem War.  Since I haven't read the rest of the trilogy yet, my quibbles might be premature. However, the Capitol is not Rome in that the technology is so advanced it is in the magic stage in comparison to the 12 Districts, which purposely have been bled dry of resources and enslaved.  This kind of technology requires scientists, doctors, technicians, biologists, system designers, major engineering and physicists.  Where are they? Where were their voices or characters? Perhaps the servants and the political sycophants are shallow and dimwitted, but that level of technology means huge brainpower and education underpin this society.  The regular citizens of Capitol are vapid, bored and looking for ever greater entertainment stimulation, not worried about actual effort or accomplishment of their own making.  The ancient Roman (and American) correlation is clear, but where is the leadership? The ancient Roman leaders were men of great personal stature, not only as educated as it was possible to be, but also men of tremendous military experience and wealth. They were ambitious and ever searching for new worlds to conquer.  Wealth was a secondary concern to advancing their family rank and class. Of course, this changed during the passage of time, and when the aristocrat class lost ambition, they turned to clothes, exotic entertainments, food and furniture, which was the beginning of their end. : )  The missing people of the political and technology spheres are the dissonance for me. There are none in this book.  If Capitol is living on the fumes of a previous functioning society, then indeed they are ripe for a revolutionary takeover. If these classes of people don't exist or they are simply more vapid and shallow aristocrats, then who is maintaining the tech? If the technology class exists, why aren't they pushing out to greater theaters of accomplishment, like space? If the political class wants power and wealth, and most do, why aren't they using the technology to invade the other continents, or at minimum doing trading and embassy work? This is why the story unhinges a bit for me and why I am such a fan of Frank Herbert.  The story proceeds from the young gladiators'viewpoint and their contact with Capitol is all about participating in a 'Reality' video entertainment, so maybe there is more to show later in regards to the other layers of Capitol.  It is still a good book to read.
Summarizing my thoughts on the Hunger Games is probably one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do, simply because I've never felt such an emotional connection to any piece of fiction before and I highly doubt my written review will be doing it justice.  North America has been completely eradicated and reborn as Panem, a bleak and twisted shadow of the nations it once comprised. Under the totalitarian regime of the Capitol, citizens are segregated into one of twelve districts, making equality and personal freedom a thing of the past. To further exude their absolute authority over the masses, the Capitol holds a spectacle of blood every year known as the Hunger Games. Every year, one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve to eighteen are picked randomly from each district to become tributes. They're then sent to the Capitol to be placed in a massive outdoor arena to fight to the death for the entertainment of all of Panem, and for the glory and benefit of the victor's district. For the denizens of District 12, poverty and the struggle for survival is their entire existence, no one understands this more than sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen. Ever since the tragic passing of her father, Katniss has tasked herself with the duty of supporting her mother and younger sister Prim. She does this by hunting on the forbidden grounds beyond District 12, and by trading her kills for other necessities. All of this changes when Prim is chosen against all odds to become a tribute for the Hunger Games. To save her sister, Katniss voluntarily becomes the tribute in her place. From there, she's whisked off to the Capitol alongside her fellow tribute and childhood acquaintance, Peeta. To survive the Hunger Games, it will take every ounce of skill, instinct, and intellect she can muster.  Suzanne Collins has a very distinct style that I've never quite seen realized before in fiction writing. Apart from her superb skill at world-building and strong characterization, it's her ability to emotionally connect the reader to the protagonist in the story. She understands how human beings naturally tend to sympathize with and form emotional attachments with people who are in a great deal of emotional trauma or physical pain. It's this intangible emotional bond with Katniss that Collins uses to effectively, and at times maliciously, pull you into her dreadful dystopia. I actually found reading the first few chapters of the Hunger Games to be difficult, not because it was bad god forbid, but because I found it to be emotionally disturbing. It's done so sadistically well that reading the Hunger Games becomes less of a desire and more of a necessity, you need to find out what happens next.  Of course this emotional connection wouldn't be possible if the protagonist wasn't likable, fortunately that couldn't be farther from the truth. Katniss as a whole essentially personifies every character trait that teen novelists almost always try to avoid. She isn't some frail flower who requires a man to define herself as an individual. Nor is she bogged down to the now very cliché snarky heroine persona that we've seen a thousand times before. Yet she still manages to have a delightfully subtle sense of humor to prevent the book from becoming completely morose in its tone. But her greatest trait that I admire is her indomitable spirit. Even when suffering through a series of physical and psychological horrors induced upon her by the Capitol, she never loses her fire.  Upon being dropped into the arena, the book drastically shifts in direction. No longer focusing on the contrived spectacle of the games and instead on the games itself. Gone are the pretty dresses, make-up, and gourmet dinners. It's a gritty, primal, and relentless struggle for survival. Collins really knows how to make a very fast paced narrative and it truly shows here. It also works in Collin's favor that Katniss isn't characterized as a cliche Hollywood bad-ass. We know she has the ingenuity, instincts, and skill-set to stand a chance at winning but she doesn't possess the mentality of a killer. This makes the notion of her becoming the victor not so far-fetched. But at the same time she always feel vulnerable thus adding precious tension and drawing us ever more into the urgent narrative that Collins so expertly weaves.  Most people will without a doubt compare this novel to other books with similar plots like The Running Man and Battle Royale. But I personally like to compare this book to George Orwell's 1984, a book that also imagined a futuristic totalitarian dystopia. He succeeded in fully realizing his horrific vision of the future, but in my opinion it fell short due to the completely flat characters and boring plot. Never once did I ever feel like a part of his world, nor did I cringe at the thought of Big Brother's gaze shadowing my every move. I was an observer, not an inhabitant and thus the shock-value that was intended was lessened in its affect. The Hunger Game's dystopian future is much more immersive due to the aforementioned emotional connection the reader shares with Katniss, something I feel 1984 could never hope to achieve. It makes the ludicrous premise of the actual Hunger Games much more believable, and thus more despicable.  There is also a romance sub-plot involving Katniss and Peeta. I had apprehension to this at first due to romances in teen novels portraying completely forced relationships between characters. Yet the Hunger Games not only avoids this pitfall, it actually manages to satire this stereotype in my eyes. In an interesting ploy, Peeta stages a romance with Katniss in the hopes of gaining the populace's favor in the Hunger Games. They've literally used the Capitol's regime of totalitarianism to deceive the masses and gain their favor. It's literally a contrived romance, yet at the same time this causes Katniss to ponder how much of it is truly deception, and if there's any sense of honesty to their relationship. But more importantly, if she can truly trust the boy who she is supposed to kill to survive. It's a very welcome change of pace from the typical love-struck schoolchildren succumbing to sheer sexual desire instead of a strong character-driven relationship. It's emotionally endearing unlike the typical cringe-worthy schlock written for the target teenage demographic.  This is the first book that I've ever read out of hundreds that will truly stay in your thoughts and pull on your conscience. It's the exceptionally paced narrative, believable world-building in conjunction with such wonderfully realized characters that'll invest you in Katniss's painful tale. Like I said at the beginning, I've never read any book in my life that upon completion has had such an emotional effect on me, and I'm sure my words aren't doing it justice. I'll just finish this by saying Suzanne Collins has created a book that has left me entranced long after I'd reached the final page. It will truly consume you.
Wow. I don't know the last time a book has made me cry. Hands down, this has been the best YA book I've read in a long time. My favorite character is Rue. I know a lot of people are going to like Katniss and Peeta, seeing as the story follows the District 12 representatives, but Rue just caught my attention. She's the youngest of the tributes, barely 12 years old, but one of the brightest personalities in the entire book.  The story is set in a time after North America - both its civilization and much of its territory - has collapsed. The Capital has taken over and separates the people into districts, with each one focusing on a different trade or skill. To stop any possible thoughts of rebellion, the Capital stages the Hunger Games every year. Each district is to send two tributes - one girl, and one boy, both between the ages of 12 to 18 - to fight to the death against all the other tributes. One person out of the 24 will survive. Whichever tribute survives will bring glory to their district, along with food and money that is desperately needed.  The book follows Katniss Everdeen, from District 12, who volunteered to keep her younger sister Prim from being sent to the Hunger Games. Through her, we get a good look at what the Hunger Games actually mean for the Districts and the tributes. Alliances are formed in the Games but ultimately end because of backstabbing and survival. But it goes further than that. Through the Games, we get to see the absolute callousness the Capital has for these children's lives. While they are fighting for their life, the Capital citizens are betting on who is going to win, while sending small gifts to help their favorites.  The characterization, plot, story, everything was executed amazingly. You get drawn into the story and react to each character, each situation, even if it's just because you want to reach into the book and shake Katniss until she sees what is right in front of her. This book makes you not just believe the emotions, but feel them as well. It gives a good, sometimes harsh but much needed look at what people can do to each other, and the lengths people will go to stay in power.
I don't know that I can say anything in a review that hasn't already been fervently said on this thrilling set of novels.  I do know that people I didn't even know would see me reading it in public and begin gushing about it, and conversations diving into deep matters of social structure have developed.  This series (with the upcoming movies) is more than just entertainment.  It has the power to change the way people think if the right conversations get going.  The buzz is widespread. Our culture just might see a smack in the face for its idiocy.  For me, the entire series truly plays upon the real-life disease we as a culture seem to be stuck in:  obsession with reality tv.  How far would our own society go to entertain an audience while simultaneously keeping the public distracted from the realities of government activity? I especially enjoyed that ultimately our beloved Katniss Everdeen realizes that pawns are used for propaganda and grim sacrifices are made on both sides of war. These books really hit home for me...this isn't just the future.  This is now.  I personally read the ENTIRE series within a few days and I haven't been this engrossed in a series in a long time.  I think these books should be added to required reading for teens in schools alongside classic social commentary and dystopian futures such as 1984 and Animal Farm.  I also want to note I purchased the movie guide 'book' and the author of these novels was there every second for the choosing of the actors, the design the costumes,and also wrote the script for the movies.  Every change that will likely be in the movie was pre-authorized by her.  I'm one of those people who gets upset when changes are made in book to movie adaptations, but knowing she gave everything the green light and knowing the director didnt do anything without her consent makes me very excited for once about book to movie adaptations.
I did enjoy the book, but not as much as I was told I would.  This is my mistake as I try to avoid judgement on a book until I've personally read it, but I really went thinking I would love the book.  First of all, many of the criticism on the book is the similarity between Hunger Games and Battle Royale.  In my opinion, I think there is probably only a handful of people who ever read Battle Royale and would never have known about the book until the comparisons came out over the internet.  The similarities are there, but to accuse someone of blatant plagarism requires a bit more proof.  To me, Running Man first came to mind when I learned about the plot and The Lottery as far as the selecion of names.  Similar does not always mean stolen.  Second, the book is an easy read, which I found great, because sometimes I am looking for something to be quick and entertaining.  Third, parents who ascert their smugness in reviews annoys me greatly.  Oh, the strong parental bonds, blah, blah, blah.  It is a book, get over it.  Also, maybe the age of the main characters also has something to do with her target audience...ever think of that?  I don't find the book as brutal as others have described and I was actually expecting worse.  Overall, I would recommend reading the book if you want a fun series.  My complaints on the book stem from the lack of outside characters.  Other than Katniss, hardly anyone else has a personality.  This is especially true when it comes to the book villains who have the worst dialogue outside of a 80's comic book.  My second complaint is the mutant pups in the book as I found this to be incredibly stupid.  This amazing technology exists to essentially resurrect the dead but they can't heal a leg?
If you are planning on seeing the movie "Hunger Games", and if that reason is because someone else wants you to see it because it is a great book, then I have one bit of advice for you....read the book first then decide.  Now for those of you who have forgotten your history North America rose in rebellion and the victorious capitol region divided the country into 12 districts. All of which get to send two teenage citizens a year in a competition to the death. And death they most certainly do. And this is the big problem I have the book is the whole sanitization of teenage death. Now before you get ready to send me an angry note  I do realize that was the point, it was a critique. A critique on violence in the communities, the extremes that reality TV is going to (when I was reading this the MTV reality TV show about teenage pregnant girls was popular) However I personally do not think it went far enough. This book, apparently targeted towards young adults could have actually been a significant piece of literature , instead, the author chickened out and played it safe.  Now on an intellectual level it was lacking. On a enjoyment level it was actually pretty good. I don't feel it was a ripoff of Running Man as some of the more sci-fi diehards among my friends have complained. It was a book, and no doubt satisfying for many people. Not everyone reads books to have worlds of thought opened for them. If it gets people reading books again then this is great. Despite my irrefutable thoughts to the contrary, not every book is written to please me.  If you are expecting this to be the most meaningful book every written you will be in for a major disappointment, but as a way to pass a day or two reading instead of watching the television, this is the right book for you.
I've been aware of The Hunger Games for awhile, but I kept putting it off for a variety of reasons, one of which being I wasn't sure if I wanted to get myself into another YA dystopian series.  However, after I saw the trailers for the movie, it looked so amazing that I knew I wanted some experience with the material before seeing it.  A theme that I enjoy in the new dystopian series' I've read over the past year or so is the necessity of having strong characters.  The future in these worlds sucks, someone has to do something about it, and I really appreciate when those people are female.  Katniss is a strong character who is used to fending for both herself and her family in an unfair world where she has no choice - they will all surely die without her efforts.  This is in stark contrast to a lot of the YA paranormal books out there, where the heroine isn't strong about anything, and looks to the men in her life to keep her safe and taken care of.  If for no reason other than that, I think this book is more worthwhile than a lot of series openers.  That being said, this is a graphically violent book which made me cry a whole lot, so be prepared.  I haven't cried that much in a book since I read the last Harry Potter.  While I very much enjoyed this book, I think it's super borderline when it comes to the young adult distinction.  It takes things a lot further than any YA books I've read in recent memory, and I would say only a mature kid should be reading it.  The Capitol's treatment of the citizens is extremely harsh and difficult to read about, so I highly recommend parental discussion throughout the book.  If you're a cautious parent, I would suggest reading it first before deciding if you are comfortable with your kids reading it.
Firstly, if you have not read this first book, I will not include any spoilers in my assessment.  If you are a fan of the Dystopian future genre i.e. Blade Runner, 1984, Logans Run, Rollerball (the one with James Caan, not the piece of garbage with LL cool J) than this should hold your attention.  Imagine taking the reality shows Survivor and the Bachelor and put them in a gladiator arena for the amusement of the sick twisted empire.  Our protaganist Katniss is a survivor, nothing special to look at very much just trying to figure out how to survive in an environemt were food is scarce and the totalitarian government treats you like a slave. Every year the government aka "capital" puts on a gladiatorial game called the "hunger games" in which one boy and one girl 12-18 is chosen from each of the 12 districts.  The book primarily focuses on our protaganist and how she makes some difficult choices about what it takes to survive in the arena.  For folks that are trying to make this like an alternative to Twilight, I scoff at you. There is very little in the first book to suggest a real love triangle.  I am also grateful that the author Ms. Collins doesn't do that horrible JK Rowling routine of inventing a problem then inventing a spell to defeat the problem (how she convinced a bunch of kids to read the same book 7 times is beyond my comprehension). Ms Collins only uses one such device in this book and it is during a moment when our protaganist is stuck up a tree without a paddle (I wont say more so as not to violate my no spoiler promise).  Although many of the tweens who have reviewed this book here and on youtube suggest that it is a blazing page turner; I found myself not in agreement. The action and intrigue is paced pretty evenly throughout the book; yet much of the time is spent basically camping in the wild (i.e. setting up camp, hunting for food, collecting water etc.).  Now since it is the "hunger games" I can sort of let all of that slide a little but there are guite a few dead slow moments in the book even during the time in the arena.  A good read and I hope the next two books go deeper into the political intrigue and how our protaganist will attempt to take down the empire from within.
THE HUNGER GAMES  Suzanne Collins  Young Adult Futuristic Dystopian  Paperback version reviewed  Review by Willa Kaye Danes, author at Penumbra Publishing  I had heard many wonderful things about this book, but avoided for a long time reading it because of the subject matter, thinking that it certainly wouldn't end well. When I finally did get the opportunity to read THE HUNGER GAMES, after having read many short and rather ho-hum, even disappointing novels billed as young-adult, I found it difficult to believe THE HUNGER GAMES is a young-adult novel. It certainly doesn't fit in the category of `ho-hum,' and it doesn't rely on paranormal or supernatural bells and whistles as a crutch to build character and suspense. Told in first-person present tense through the female protagonist Katniss Everdeen, THE HUNGER GAMES made an immediate and lasting impression. Upon reading the first couple pages, I devoured this book (pun intended). And my eagerness to finish it in no way was diminished by the knowledge that it would have to end, because the ending held up to my best expectations, even though it certainly paved the way for the sequel.  In case you haven't read the more than 4,000 customer reviews on Amazon (the majority of them glowing), I will briefly summarize the plot. However much I wish it to be true, this review can in no way give proper praise to this book.  In the not-too-distant future, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen lives with her mother and twelve-year-old sister Prim in District 12, what was once part of Appalachia in former United States of America, but is now one of the cordoned-off and policed areas of Panem, carved out after a quashed rebellion. In this future, people in outlying districts don't fare too well. Food is rationed and scarce for the outlying districts, and only the relatively well-to-do can afford heat and food enough to ward off Mr. Death. People are afraid to speak their mind for fear of being overheard by those evil bastards in Capital City.  In Capital City, the streets might as well be paved with gold when compared to the living arrangements of Kat and her family and most others in the outer districts. But after her father dies in a coal mining accident, Kat carries on the illegal task of `poaching' - hunting in the unfenced forest outside the district to bring game home for trade and to feed her family. She and her hunting partner, an eighteen-year-old boy named Gale, have forged an alliance that benefits almost everyone in the district with extra food, and profitable trading eases the rules that would otherwise be imposed by the resident Peacekeepers.  Once a year, Capital City `reminds' the other districts of their transgression of failed rebellion with the hugely promoted fanfare of The Hunger Games. Each district is required to furnish one girl and one boy between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the survival game, which is to the death, with only one winner. That victory ensures the winner of an easy life and benefits of more food and other extras for the winner's district. Kat has put in extra entries for herself in the lottery in exchange for extra portions of food and heating fuel for her family throughout the year. She waits tensely to see whose name is chosen for this year's games. When her sister's name is called, she immediately volunteers to go in her place.  Words fail me in trying to describe how absolutely perfect this story is. It is not simply the story itself, but the unique blend of plot, character development, and beautiful economy of words that all worked wonderfully together to make this an entirely believable and absorbing read. Many an author gets blinded by the light of a well-turned phrase, but Ms. Collins stays true to her writing task in that the writing skill remains invisible so the reading pleasure can be fully realized.  It has been, as I stated before, a very long time since I have read a young-adult novel-length story that was so emotionally moving without being over-dramatic or maudlin. Kat is the perfect heroine - tough and emotionally distant, yet in her own way caring and respectful of life. The way her attitudes and beliefs are pitted against the very fabric of the opulently excessive society that created the situation certain to cause her death is a stroke of writing genius. I am eager to see it repeated in the next installment of this trilogy, and can't wait to get my hands on the rest of this series. Also I will be standing in line to see the movie version of this story and compare it to the graceful success of this book.  This is the kind of story that any author would be grateful and proud to have written, and it is an excellent example of superb writing. I have no idea how much careful and judicious editing was involved to create the final product, but for any author hoping to write well, no matter what the genre, I offer this book as a learning experience and enthusiastically recommend it to all readers. This is how it's done!
Hunger Games. It's everywhere in the media. I can't escape it on TV and I can't escape it on the best sellers lists on Amazon. I can't even escape it at work when people are reading it and asking me questions about it. I can't escape.  I bought the book months back when Amazon had a sale on the trilogy for $5. I bought it, I read the first two chapters and set it down. At that point, I was confused. Why did people like this book? How utterly depressing this world seems to be. After a bit of research and constantly asking people why they liked it, I came to think of it something like Twilight. People read it because someone said to, they felt they were supposed to like it and so they did. But, very rarely can anyone say WHY they liked it.  A common response I get is "strong lead female" and OK, that makes sense. It's a YA novel, we need that for our girls to grow up and become strong leaders of their own. She's self-sufficient, that's certain, and she's determined. She capitalizes on skills she learned from her father and friend and helps her family to survive through the years. She then uses those skills in the game to survive there.  As I type this, I keep thinking of the prophecy from Harry Potter which says, "Neither can live while the other survives." I never feel like she's doing more than survive, she's not thriving, living or even growing. She's just hanging on for dear life.  Now, granted, I'm not sure I'd be able to get through what she did but the viewpoint we see from the story has her time in the games as pretty easy and cushy. She's not truly struggling at all.  I dunno, I just can't figure out why I wasn't impressed with her or this book. It wasn't bad, it was a fast read. I think because it was YA it flowed faster and only skated on the surface of "big ideas" but it was just .. meh.  Having finished it, I now have to debate finishing the other two books. I imagine it'll be more of the same as the first and then of course we'll have drama drama drama from the love triangle. Oh joy.  Katniss is in a unique position and I fear she won't get her head out of her ass long enough to do something about it. Yeah yeah yeah, she's young, she's been thrust into this role, etc etc... but really, if she's a strong female lead shouldn't she step up?
This review was originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner  Katniss Everdeen is a wonderful, strong, female character. She is a fighter and survivor but not completely calloused to love. I feel like that last bit is incredibly important to her character and how she develops throughout the story. I also love how confident she is in her abilities. Some readers took this as arrogance, I took this as advice to teen girls, telling them that they SHOULD be confident in their abilities. I truly love Katniss's love for her family, compassion for her opponents (at least those who deserved it), and strength to keep fighting.  Peeta Mellark is not your typical male character. While brute force is not his forte, his cleverness and charm makes him a strong contender in the Hunger Games. The son of a baker, he is easily looked over and considered soft. But there is something far greater than strength that keeps Peeta fighting.  Now for some supporting characters. Haymitch Abernathy is the victor of the 50th Hunger Games. He is to be the mentor of Katniss and Peeta for the 74th Hunger Games. Well, if he can stay sober. Cinna is Katniss and Peeta's sytlist because they must look good on TV while slashing and beating each other to death. And Rue. A small, twelve year old from District 11. You will love her.  As for the plot of the story, I thought it was wonderful. It moved along nicely, there were some nice twists. At times it was slightly predictable, but I was perfectly okay with that. And as for the descriptions, they were not overly done like I tend to see in more young adult novels. But by the same token, it was by no means under descriptive either. It gave you plenty to visualize, but left a lot up to imagination too.  Along with loving the characters and the plot, I give this book such a high rating because of how much I love dystopian novels.
You're probably wondering why I rated this book five stars given the title of my review.  Well, this first book in the Hunger Games Trilogy definitely deserves such a high rating, but I think readers should be warned about how the story progresses in the other two installments.  I found the first book to be truly an engaging and riveting read about Katniss Everdeen, one of twenty-four contestants fighting to the death in a politically-motivated and televised event orchestrated by the Capitol. The Capitol is seen as the ruler that forces a boy and a girl from twelve districts to participate in the Hunger Games each year to remind the people in the districts that they are at the Capitol's mercy.  Suzanne Collins delivers such an intense emotional experience that even when I took breaks from reading, I found myself thinking about the characters, the story, and even my own life.  The Hunger Games is not a sappy teenage novel in any stretch of the imagination-it is so much more, too complicated to sum up in this small review.  Katniss' action at the end of the first installment triggers a rebellion against the Capitol, which left me with a sense of hope that the district people would finally be able to fight against all the injustices brought on by the Capitol and succeed, but I was wrong. No one ever truly succeeds.  After the rebellion ensues, a war is triggered. The second book deals with the rebellion, the third with the war.  If you think the first installment carried with it a dark and depressing tone, well, you haven't even experienced the tip of the iceberg.  Almost all characters you grow to love meet horrible deaths. Katniss' family and friends aren't spared either. They are tortured and killed in agonizing detail. The strong heroine you meet in the opening chapters of The Hunger Games wittles away into a tormented soul, plagued by nightmares and haunting images of her friends and family. Her memories destroy her, and leave her a hollow shell.  She even loses her best friend; the horrors of the war, not death, driving them apart. This was so sad and gut-wrenching to me. Many readers argue that Collins betrays the true nature of this character for the sake of the ending, and I agree.  I loved the first half of Catching Fire, the second installment, as much as the first book until Katniss and Peeta are forced to endure another round of the games. This part signaled to me that there would be more darkness ahead rather than light.  Then, in the third installment, Mockingay, everything finally unravels and falls apart completely. The reader is left with no sense of hope, and it left me depressed. To be honest, I read a little over a third of Mockingjay before I decided that I wouldn't force myself to continue such a dreadful story. I skipped to the Epilogue just to get some closure, but there was none to be had.  Part of me wishes I would have never picked up this Trilogy, another part of me wishes I would have stopped after the first book and remembered the characters the way they were. Strong and full of hope.
Before I even start to review this book, I will admit to you all that "The Hunger Games" is not the type of book that I would normally read.  The dust jacket did not even appeal to me at all, so why in the world would I, not only read The Hunger Games, but also the following two sequels?  The answer is simple....... The books are that good!!!  I discovered this trilogy of  books thru word of mouth.  They were recommended to me by a few fellow knitters, whom couldn't seem to put them down, even to knit. I looked at them occasionally, read some reviews and finally, after pondering on them for a few months,  took the plunge and bought all three.  I then found myself jumping into the world of The Hunger Games  "Whole Hog" as we say here in the south.  Book begins with describing the world that Katniss Everdeen and her family are forced to live in, by the capital of Panem and President Snow.  The story revolves around " The Games" held once a year, as the players fight for their very lives.  From all of the players, only one person can walk from the arena, alive and be proclaimed as "The Victor".  As the  story unfolds you will experience love, hate, hope, betrayal, loyalty and revenge.  You will see the struggle for survival and compassion for the dying.  I will warn you, this book will cause you to think.  What would you do , if you were thrown into the same arena, in the same situation and had to fight for your life.  This is a great book for the young, as well as old.  Everyone can take something away from The Hunger Games.  The only real disappointment I had with the first two books, were the abrupt ending.  If you don't buy the sequels, you will be left hanging.  The Closure will only come at the end of the third book Mockingjay.  I will read these three books again, in the future.  All three are a wonderful addition to my personal library.  I look forward to reading all three books again with my neice, when she is old enough to understand and enjoy them.  I also feel as they would make a great Book Club read with an in dept discussion on each book.  I highly recomend "The Hunger Games" book 1,  "Catching Fire" book 2 and "Mockingjay" book 3 by Suzanne Collins.
