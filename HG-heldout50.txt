In a dystopian future North America as we know it has been destroyed and from its ashes rose the Capital and it's 13 Districts. The Capital was powerful and greedy and ruled the districts with an iron fist. When the districts rose up against them the Capital completely destroyed District 13 and subjugated the remaining 12. To keep the Districts in check they force each one to give up one girl and one boy between the ages of 12 and 17. The children must participate in The Hunger Games, a live televised fight to the death aired for the enjoyment of the residents of the Capital, the Districts are forced to watch in horror as their children are murdered right in front of them.  Katniss Everdeen is a 16-year-old who lives in District 12. She has been forced to provide for her family all her life as her father passed away in a mining accident when she was young. Her mother went into a catatonic state of depression afterward leaving Katniss to care for herself and her younger sister alone. Feeling abandoned and alone Katniss ends up drawing on the skills her father taught her: using bow and arrow, foraging and hunting in the forest, and surviving and supporting a family. When her younger sister Prim turns twelve and gets entered into the reaping for The Hunger Games the worst happens. Her little sister is chosen. Katniss sacrifices herself and volunteers in her sister's place. Now she needs to see if her survival skills can transfer from providing for her family to staying alive in the arena as she faces the cruel carnage and inhumanity of The Hunger Games.  This book was absolutely riveting. I could not put it down. Every chapter ends on a cliff hanger and in between the plot is kept hopping and everything from the action, to the dialogue, the character development to the back story are written in very neat and tight leaving just enough left over so that you are asking for more. It is the very definition of a page turner.  The over arching themes about modern day reality television and violence as entertainment, combined with the dystopian ones of control, power and helplessness in a controlled state added a lot of depth and meaning to the book. At first glance the premise seems impossible but within two chapters you are utterly convinced of the viability and reality of such a world existing. I thought the world building and back story that built up this book were very well done and realistically portrayed.  The very premise of the book is one of violence for pleasure, and for a book like that to be done in such a way that still shows respect for the characters lives and the readers who are reading the book, I think, shows true talent. The deaths were handled very tastefully and with true feeling. Everyone's death, from the most helpless child to the most dangerous bloodthirsty opponent on the field, is portrayed in a very compassionate and in some cases touching way.  I have been recommending this book to everyone to read. The writing is vivid, fast paced and packs quite a punch. This is one you will read in no time flat but be left thinking about for a long time. If you haven't read it yet, you really need to. This is not one to miss out on!
The Hunger Games is the first book in a dystopian trilogy (third book set to come out in August 2010) by Suzanne Collins, author of the children's series the Underland Chronicles. In The Hunger Games Panem, a futuristic North America, is divided into 13 Districts. Every year a boy and girl age 18 or younger must be sent from each district to participate in the Hunger Games. Collins tracks the journey of 16 year old Katniss from District 12 through her participation in the Hunger Games. Collins artfully crafts this intense novel from Katniss' point of view, requiring the reader to constantly piece information together along with Katniss in her quest for survival. Since Collins knows Katniss intimately, the reader is able to develop a close attachment to Katniss and to other characters through her eyes. Far from being laborious, her quest is riveting and leaves the reader hungry for more.  The prospect of using a dystopian society as the theme of a novel is not new, and  but Collins includes a rather fresh and scathing comment on the media, government, and what it might become as she uses aspects of current media practices to make her point. Collins comments on the role of media, its potential power and the advocacy of superficiality, with particular emphasis on the dangers and absurdity of reality television. Her comments on media and reality TV also directly relate to control of the masses. The citizens of Panem are only able to view, experience, and communicate that which the government deems appropriate. This results in the extreme oppression and isolation of citizens who are not allowed to leave their own districts and only hear rumors of what goes on in others.  Further emphasizing Collins' theme of isolation is the fact that she did not include a map of Panem in The Hunger Games. This is at once frustrating and intriguing. The lack of a map showing the division of North America is frustrating at times, considering how significant location is to the overall themes of the book. Conversely, the lack of map also provides the opportunity for the reader to learn about Panem as Katniss does, furthering the connection between character and reader, since the reader only has Katniss' knowledge base.  Though Collins' subject matter in The Hunger Games, much like her Underland Chronicles, is dark and her characters face difficult, life-threatening  and often gruesome choices, the book is thought-provoking, suspenseful and entertaining. It contains many of the ideas regarding government control that are present in The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood and manipulation of the young as in Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. The Hunger Games is a good read for any young adult looking for an action-packed book filled with daunting possibilities of a dystopian future.
I'm easy when it comes to dystopian, post apocalyptic fiction- LOVE it- but this novel goes beyond it's setting. Populated with empathetic, engaging characters and edge of your seat PANIC, it's so well done I would have enjoyed it even set in the here and now.  But it's not. Taking place, I assume, sometime in the future or in some sort of alternate timeline, the United States are no longer states, but districts- and those in control seem to be doing everything they can to keep them less than united.  Each district has a purpose- to supply the wealthy, well-fed capital with all that it wants and needs- with some of the districts less thought of than others.  Katniss comes from the poorest district, District 12- the district which supplies coal to the capital.  Katniss, her mother and her sister don't have much, but what they do have they have Katniss to thank for. With her father dead and her mother weakened by depression, Katniss and her family have never had a rich morsel of food their entire life but she keeps hunger just barely at bay with illegal hunting and clever bartering.  On the biggest day of the year, the day the Capital forces all youth to take part in a drawing for The Hunger Games, Katniss is wary of being one of the ones chosen from her district- as the more times you make it to the lottery, the more chances your number will be called- but she's thankful that her little sister, Primrose, who's only coming to the games for the first time, will more than likely not be chosen.  Fear strikes her heart when low and behold Prim's name is indeed called out and before she knows it, Katniss volunteers to take her beloved little sister's place as a contender for a survival game that will mean certain death.  The games are cruel, deadly, and put on for no purpose but to entertain the masses and Katniss is about to make history- if she doesn't die in the first five seconds!  I loved this book! I'm not a huge Young Adult fiction fan, but The Hunger Games captured my imagination from the first words- and if you are a sci fi/ fantasy lover, you'll be hooked just as quickly! And even if you aren't a sci fi fan- I can pretty much guarantee you'll enjoy it for the the "fight-the-power" theme in this book crosses all boundaries.  Katniss is a great heroine and one to be emulated- unlike another popular YA character we know **cough** Bella **cough, cough**- she's fierce in protecting her family and those she loves, she has a noble sense of honor, she's cleverly independent- but don't think she won't do whatever she has to, to survive. There's a budding romance as well in this tale and I'm sensing a love-triangle not far behind.  I'm so looking forward to reading more! 5 out of 5 from me.
Hunger Games drops you into a future where the United States has been destroyed and all that remains is Panem, a dystopian civilization made up of 12 districts and a Capital city. The Capital controls everything with an iron fist and a previous attempt at rebellion by the 12 districts resulted in the creation of a disturbing event known as the The Hunger Games. Every year each of the 12 districts has to choose one girl and one boy to compete in this televised game of survivor where you either win or you die, and there can only be one winner.  Katniss is a 16 year old girl with far too much responsibility on her shoulders. She protects and provides for her mother and sister with no regard for herself. She is independent, caring, and humble. When her sister's name gets pulled from the glass bowl as this year's female tribute to the Hunger Games, there is no question that Katniss will take her place. I loved Katniss from page 1 of this book. She is so strong, and yet still a vulnerable 16 year old when no one is looking. I had tears in my eyes and a sob in my throat before I had even gotten to page 25 because of the lengths she went to for her family. Katniss is a character you will root for and become emotionally attached to.  The beginning of the novel started a bit slow for me, it was all necessary to the story but I was anxious to get to the games and to find out whether Katniss even had a chance at staying alive. Once I got a third of the way through, I simply could not put this book down. The story was action packed, smart, and captivating. My pulse raced and I held my breath along with Katniss every step of the way. I felt her despair and desperation. I felt her joys and her I cheered her on.  If you are looking for a smart, fascinating, unique story with noble and likable characters then Hunger Games will not disappoint you. Don't let the Young Adult genre designation dissuade you, book lovers of all ages with enjoy this one.
Plot/Storyline: 4 3/4 Stars  Reminiscent of Stephen King's The Running Man,this was an incredibly fast-paced book that held my attention throughout the entire thing. Even though I wanted to find out what happened at the end, I didn't actually want it to end.  The world created by Ms. Collins was rich with imagination and just the right amount of detail. Readers weren't bogged down with having to learn and memorize a new history of the world. Instead, small portions were delivered a little at a time within the story.  The action, while horrifying at times, still remained on the subtle side of goriness. There was a little bit of blood and guts, but it was definitely handled tastefully and not just thrown in for shock value.  I was a little disappointed by the ending as it was almost one of those "I'm going to force you to buy the sequel" endings. I say "almost" because this book did have an ending and a resolution of the greater portion of the plot. So, it was definitely okay as a stand alone.  Character Development: 4 Stars  Katniss seemed a little too naive, even for a teenager. I would have thought that a teen growing up in such poverty would be a little more `people saavy'. Also, at sixteen, I would think that hormones would take over at least a little; however, she is completely oblivious to not only Peeta, but any male.  Writing Style: 4 Stars  Ms. Collins chose to write her novel in present tense. In my reading experience, I have found that this is one of the hardest tenses for an author to write in. While most of the time, the tense was appropriate and made for great storytelling, there were errors where the wrong tense was used.  The descriptions were excellent. I was happily surprised at the common language used in the dialogue. So many authors who write about `alternate futures,' force readers to learn a whole new language while trying to enjoy a story. Ms. Collins only throws in a few new words here and there, and those were easily pronounced, making for smooth reading.  Editing/Formatting: 4 3/4 Stars  There were some changes in font with the letters going from big to small and back again that made for some distraction. It didn't happen often, though.  The editing was of professional quality.  Rating: PG-14 for Violence
THE HUNGER GAMES is a fantastic, breathless and somewhat brutal read that once you start you simply can't put down again. Initially I had no idea what this book was about or what to expect in terms of YA writing, it had just been recommended to me by so many people and had such a buzz surrounding it that I had to find out for myself why. Well let me say I was not disappointed and have now joined the legions of Suzanne Collins fans in awaiting her next instalment. Written along the lines of Stephen King's THE LONG WALK or Orwell's 1984 (I may be aging myself here) this story still feels very original and sucked me in completely with its modern day Survivor-esque retelling. The Hunger Games is the ultimate in reality TV, suspense, romance, scripted realism and survival that you shouldn't miss.  Set in a post apocalyptic future (although we frustratingly never learn the whys, how's or even when of this future.) This new communist-type America known as Panem has been divided into a Capital and its 12 districts. We follow 16 year old Katniss as she struggles to keep her starving family alive, hunting and gathering with her best friend Gale. Unbeknownst to her these are valuable skills as the annual hunger games are about to begin. Each year these games require two children from each district who are chosen based on a lottery system for compulsory participation. These televised games are then broadcast throughout Panem (with mandatory viewing) as the 24 contestants fight each other to the death, leaving just one victor at its violent conclusion. It's kind of like survivor but instead of being voted off you have to kill your competitors. When Katniss's younger sister is chosen as the female contestant from their district Katniss volunteers to take her place. Then together with Peeta the other lottery winner they travel to the capital and begin preparations for the opening ceremonies and ultimately their death in The Hunger Games.  Oddly this has been written without paragraph breaks and I have to admit the first part of it dragged for me, as Katniss is groomed, clothed, and schooled by her entourage within the capital. However as soon as the games begin, lookout! By this point in the story you have become attached to several key characters and its then that you realize things can't end well as there will be only one winner. Over a period of about 2 weeks and against overwhelming odds we watch 24 victims dwindle as they struggle to survive. Simultaneously avoiding and hunting each other they form alliances, face hunger and mind numbing thirst, mutant animal attacks, friendship, love and ultimately a distrust of everyone as Big Brother raises the stakes to keep the audience interested.  This is an exciting book that will keep you up late into the night and resonate with you long after you've finished. Cheers!
Alot of people have already described what this book is about. So I'll skip a breakdown of what it's actually about.  Here's what I really enjoyed about the book.  The writing. The characters.  While reading this book, I wasn't bored once. It had the wonderful balance to keep you involved in what was happening. It described living in District 12 as something that reminded me of what I think would feel like if I lived during the Great Depression. Just that kind of environment where there's not alot of food to go around.  I enjoyed the intro to the last page and was captivated by the story. I did feel a little like it was mature content and what kind of society would allow something like that to happen to children -- but then again, in the olden days, young kids were sent to Mills to work for cheap money until child labor laws came into play so....feasible, but terrible.  I could sympathize why Haymitch was drunk all the time. Not only did Katniss nail it on the head in the book-- having to sponsor children who in all liklihood would be killed -- but .... living through that would be terrible on your conscience. In the game, you would do what you had to do to survive-- but when it was all over, living with yourself, would be very hard I would think.  I felt that the characters were very descriptive and they made the plot of the book work, even as terrible of an idea as children killing each other to survive sounds.  The ending was so abrupt. I sat there, blinking at the last page and wanted to know sooo badly what Katniss' reunion would be like. But I will not break down and buy the next book in hard cover. I still want it for my Kindle. I'm stubborn enough to wait...or to go to the library if I positively can't stand the wait.  Wonderful book and yes, perhaps I should just break down and buy it to show my support for the book in hardcover, but I love my Kindle and that's where I'd like to read the next book. The adjustable font, portability, my carry case, everything about my Kindle...I love. So that's where I'd like to hold a book that I'd enjoy reading :)
I read this book November 2008 but I had to do a review on it here because it was AWESOME. My definition of awesome may be different than other people's, but this book was just ... great.  It is based on a post-apocalyptic North America that has already endured wars over remaining resources and then a government arose called "The Capitol" and organized 13 districts across the continent. Needless to say the districts did not like the capitol so they formed a rebellion. Well, the capitol won by a landslide because they have all the money and technology and they completely annihilated district 13 - leaving nothing alive. Anyway, to make sure that the districts never form any such rebellion again The Capitol holds the annual Hunger Games to remind everyone that they are in charge.  The Hunger games begin by having a lottery and they pick 1 girl and 1 boy from each district between the ages of 12 and 18 to compete in these hunger games (so a total of 24 contestants). So you wonder, "How does holding a competition make people stay in line?" The answer is simple, it's a fight to the death.  They hold the competition in a huge arena that varies in landscape from year to year. The desert, mountains, etc. It's a huge arena that use tiny cameras to catch all the excitement and the game makers can control all the variables. If things aren't interesting enough for those watching they can start a massive forest fire, or unleash some rabid beast. The last remaining contestant is the victor and they are granted fame and glory.  The book starts on the day of the 79th annual Hunger Games lottery.  The rest of the book is completely unpredictable which is why I liked it so much. When I put it down Sunday night to go to bed my brain kept trying to figure out ways that the book could possibly end up and out of all the ways it came up with ... it never did figure out the actual story line.  Anyway, the only bad part about the book was when I found out it's the first book in a trilogy so there will be 2 more books to come. The next one - Catching Fire - came out in Sept 2009 and the last book comes out August 24, 2010.  The first book does stand alone ... there is a definite "ending", but then you read the last page and you wish you would have stopped reading just 1 page earlier because now you have to wait another year to figure out how the story "really ends" and then another year after that to find out how THAT story ends.  I really hate waiting.
The first comment I'm going to make about this book is that if you're intrigued by the synopsis you should definitely read the book. It took me only 2 days to read because from the opening chapter I didn't want to put the book down. It was well written, the characters were well developed and the story just grabbed my imagination.  I'm not going to waste time with an elaborate description of the story because I'm guessing you've already read it somewhere else. But I will say that the hopelessness of the situation the main character, Katniss, is in really grabbed me. Here's a 16 year old girl who gets thrust into these games where there is virtually no chance of her getting out alive. She's going to a place where there are 23 other competitors who viscously want to kill her because its the only chance at survival. The quality of the writing actually made me anxious myself because I could just imagine being in her shoes. And when the author stuck to the story of Katniss trying to survive the book continued to be intriguing.  The one area of this book that fell short was the subplot between Katniss and the supporting character Peeta. Suzanne Collins tried to add too much of a romantic storyline to a survivalist story and she didn't balance it very well. The result was that it took the anxiety of the situation away, I stopped worrying about the fact that the main character was being hunted by desperate teenagers, many of whom were enjoying themselves. This led to the ending of the book being a bit of a disappointment mainly because the feeling of desperation left me a number of chapters before.  The majority of the book in my opinion was excellent and I have eagerly started reading Book 2 in the trilogy. I'm hoping Collins can bring back the powerful emotions that the first book created but failed to sustain. But like I said at the beginning, if you read the synopsis and were intrigued, definitely read this book.
The Hunger Games is set in futuristic North America in a country called Panem.  Life in North America is over as we know it.  Panem has a center of operations called The Capitol and twelve outlying districts that are titled merely by number.  Each year the Capitol requires two tributes, or sacrifices, from each district to participate in the Hunger Games.  Every name of every boy and girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen are put into a lottery, and one boy and one girl is chosen at random to participate in the annual televised fight to the death.  The story is told from the perspective of Katniss, a sixteen year old girl living with her mother and twelve-year-old sister in District 12.  Her father was killed in a coal mining accident several years ago, and Katniss is now the sole provider for her family.  She feeds her family by hunting illegally in the woods beyond the wire fence that keeps residents from escaping from the District.  When her sister's name is drawn in the lottery, Katniss immediately volunteers to take her place.  I first heard about this book from a friend who clipped a review about The Hunger Games and the sequel book, Catching Fire, from Time Magazine.  The idea that struck me most in that review was the last three lines: "Kids are physical creatures, and they're not stupid. They know all about violence and power and raw emotions. What's really scary is when adults pretend that such things don't exist."  In this incredible novel, violence and power are central in the lives of all citizens.  The Capitol holds all the power and the citizens of each District live within the prisons of their cities.  People are left to starve to death or are routinely killed for such actions as killing a deer for food or trying to run away.  Medicine is scarce and even the baker's family eats the stale food that doesn't sell.  Children in District 12 live in fear of losing a parent in the coal mines, because without a provider they are doomed to starvation.  When Katniss volunteers to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games, she is joined by Peeta, a boy who she barely knows.  Within a few days of the lottery drawing, Peeta declares to the world that he has always loved Katniss, and suddenly the fight to survive the Killing Arena becomes a game of cunning, violence, love, power, and skill.  Ms. Collins takes us into a world where things are exactly as they seem; corrupt, unfair, destitute and violent.  Nothing is sugar-coated and at least everyone knows where they stand.  Through Katniss, the reader discovers that there is a piece of personal power that can be wielded in a world that seems bent on the destruction of dignity, friendship, compassion, justice, and love.  I wasn't sure if this story would be difficult to stomach and hesitated to begin reading once I bought it from the bookstore.  After several weeks of psyching myself up, I quickly discovered that I couldn't put this book down, and read it even during meal times.  The on-screen romance that Peeta and Katniss purport is strangely non-erotic and entirely believable.  They realized that romance was what the viewers in the Capitol wanted, and they conspired to deliver, realizing that their performance bought them good-will and gifts from sponsors.  I hesitate to categorize this book.  Is it Adventure?  Romance?  Suspense?  Young-Adult?  Truthfully, it is all those things, which is what makes this such a good read.  Young adults will love this, but adults will enjoy this as much as they enjoyed the Harry Potter and Twilight series.  Suzanne Collins joins the ranks of J.K. Rowling and Stephanie Meyer in understanding what kids innately know; the world is a scary, violent place, and no amount of reassurance from parents will change that fact.  She dives head-long into this post-Apocalyptic world, and invites the reader to experience the raw human emotions of greed, violence, power and will to survive.  The world is just as it seems; bent on destruction.  The question is; who will be the winner?
This is  not the type of book that I usually read. It's considered dystopian fiction, science fiction, futuristic. I was on the fence about reading this book, even after reading many rave reviews. I have to say that I did like The Hunger Games..a lot! I found the story very entertaining and at the same time disturbing and brutal but gripping. It's a book that is hard to put down. The story is told sometime in the future, you don't know the time period as a reader. The world as we know it has ended and there is only a Capital and twelve districts. There was an uprising and a thirteenth district was destroyed. As a reminder to the tributes (the citizens) that the Capital has the power, they hold the Hunger games each year. A girl and boy aged 12 and up are chosen randomly from each district to fight for survival in a televised event called the Hunger Games. It's like a futuristic reality TV show of our time. There are 24 girls and boys and only one is allowed to be the winner.  That means you must try to survive and win which means killing your opponents and honor your district or lose and be killed.  The book is told from the perspective of 16 year old Katniss who has volunteered to go into the games in place of her younger sister. She knows that she must use her skills and survival techniques that she has learned to survive in her own district.  Things become complicated when she realizes the connection she has to Peeta, the boy chosen from her district. Their connection brings up mixed feelings and emotions that she never realized until the process to the games begins. What she doesn't count on is the brutality and emotions that accompany this game. It is a fight until the end and the story holds you as a reader immersed in the world of the Hunger Games until the conclusion. Then, you realize that it is not over yet as there is more...a second book Catching Fire.  This is a unique book, one that I really enjoyed even with the darkness and brutality. The sheer wit and determination of Katniss and the tributes makes you want to keep reading. Now, I have to find a copy of Catching Fire and there is a third book in the series that is to be published later this year. Exciting stuff, I have more to look forward to.  Personally, I wouldn't recommend The Hunger Games for anyone under twelve unless you think that your child has the maturity to handle violence.
What can I say about The Hunger Games that hasn't already been said a thousand times? I'm not sure but I'm going to try and do justice to this amazing book.  I feel as though I'm one of the last people on the planet to have read this, but I'm so glad I took the jump and picked it up off my shelf. There's no reason I've been putting it off, just that I was worried I wouldn't enjoy it. Luckily with a bit of peer pressure from Katie and just not being able to wait in general I started reading it... and couldn't stop. I probably could have devoured it in a day, but unfortunately I started it just as Winter Break was ending, so not much time to read. I still finished it after a couple of days and it's definitely one of the best books I've ever read. Katniss was a remarkable character with all the power and stamina needed in a strong female role. I really liked Peeta as well. I didn't get enough of Gale to completely choose whose side I'm on, but for now I'm Team Peeta. He and Katniss balanced each other out. There wasn't a ton of romance in the book, but I like Peeta and Katniss's relationship. I liked most of the characters in this book. It was easy to dislike the bad guys and to get attached to the likable characters. There was a lot of emotion in The Hunger Games and the plot kept me at the edge of my seat throughout. It was such an original plot idea and although at first I wasn't sure I was going to like it, I definitely did. Collins drew me into the Games so I felt like I was watching them myself. Rooting for my favorite contestants and grimacing at the bloodshed. I can't imagine living in that time, and I don't know how I could fare in the Games- not well I can say that. The ending was definitely a cliff hanger and I can't wait to get started on Catching Fire.  In Catching Fire I'm hoping to hear more about Gale, even though I'm pretty attached to Peeta! As well as finding out more about Prim and some of the other characters I liked in The Hunger Games. A 5 Star read that I'm going to recommend to anyone and everyone. If you're on the fence about reading The Hunger Games I suggest you hop onto the reading it side right now, it's a book unlike any other!  Rating;  Plot: 10/10  Characters: 10/10  Ending: 10/10  Enjoyment: 10/10  Cover: 10/10  --  Overall: 50/50= 100%
I just finished re-reading one of the best books that I've read all year. It easily makes the top 5, possibly even the top spot. The book is called "The Hunger Games", and it's by Suzanne Collins. This is the first book of a Young Adult dystopia trilogy, but really it's a book that will appeal to readers of any age.  The book takes place in an alternate reality. Imagine our country in the future. There have been wars, famine, natural disasters, and a complete and total breakdown of our government and country. What is left is a country called Panem, which consists of the Capital and 12 districts throughout the nation. While the Capital is very wealthy, the districts are very pour. There's no welfare system. You are completely on your own. And the laws are brutal. If you break them, you'll either be subjected to a whipping or more likely be killed. This is not a fun country to grow up in. The main character is a 16-year old girl named Katniss. She is quite the survivor. At the age of 11, her father is killed in a mine explosion and she becomes the soul provider for her mother and little sister Prim. Every day, Katniss and her best friend Gale risk their lives by breaking the law, sneaking under the fence that surrounds their district and going into the woods to hunt, fish, and gather plants and berries. Anything that their family doesn't need for food gets traded on the black market for essentials. Although life is far from pleasant, Katniss and her family are surviving well enough.  But then comes Reaping Day when everything changes. Once a year, the Capital holds The Hunger Games. It's basically their way of showing the districts who is in charge, and who has all the control. 1 boy and 1 girl (called Tributes) from each of the districts has to compete in the ultimate game of survivor. Only one of the 24 will leave the arena alive. Katniss becomes one of the tributes and now she is literally in the fight of her life. She just has to hope that her brains, and nerve, and talent will be enough to keep her alive. She also has to decided who she can trust, or if she can trust anyone. What are people's ulterior motives for what they say and do?  This book has everything! Action, suspense, mystery, friendship, romance, humor in the most unlikely places, and a great psychological element! Once you start reading, you wont want to put the book down!
#1 Hunger Games YA fantasy series. Katniss Everdeen is sixteen this Reaping day--the day when Tributes from all the districts of Panem--a post-apocalyptic country somewhere in future North America--are chosen. Tributes are children between twelve and eighteen, a boy and a girl from each district, who will fight to the death in a nationally televised (watching is mandatory) program called The Hunger Games. Sort of a reality show on steriods!Her name is in the barrel many times, so Katniss is totally shocked when her little sister Prim's name is chosen. She loves Prim more than anything, and thus invokes a rarely used rule and volunteers to take her place, knowing that this most likely means a death sentence for her as no one from district twelve has won the Games for years. Like the Olympics, the Tributes survive because of their sponsors, and when you come from the poor mining district, no one is interested in backing you.  She and Peeta, the boy accompanying her from district twelve, are off to the Capitol, where their dictatorship is ruled from, to have a couple weeks of training before being sent into The Arena--where the terrain, the wildlife, the weather and available resources are controlled by the powers that be. More than anything they want an exciting show, so if the various Tributes were to just isolate themselves, they would do 'something' to bring them together for confrontations. Implanted with tracking chips before being released, the Tributes know that they are being watched 24/7.  I found this book gripping, compelling, horrifying and very difficult to stop listening to.  The characters were very well-drawn, and it wasn't long before you felt you knew Katniss inside and out and liked her despite her foibles. I cannot speak highly enough about this book and am very much looking forward to listening to the next one. The sad thing is, I find this whole scenario to be not as fantastical as it should be. This audiobook was skillfully read by Carolyn McCormick. A+
I'd heard the hype about Hunger Games since before its release and it continued to gain momentum and discussion around the web.  Cautiously avoiding spoilers, I grabbed hold of a general synopsis and quickly got the feeling that this is a book I would enjoy.  I'm generally a fan of books set in dystopian and/or post-apocalyptic futures.  I also really enjoy the sort of man vs. man struggles like those portrayed here...where the struggle isn't one caused by "normal" motivations but rather through some sort of contrived situation.  To those unfamiliar with the plot of this book...it's set in the future after the general downfall of American government.  The country is now divided into specific Districts, each of which is responsible for producing a certain type of good or service for the good of the nation and especially for the good of the Capitol.  Our main character (a teenage girl named Katniss) is from District 12, where they are responsible for coal production.  The Capitol has a set of very stringent rules regarding any sort of mobility (essentially you're born, live and die within your District and it's unlikely you'll ever see outside of the fences surrounding it), the management, production and sale of goods...particularly food.  Most citizens receive barely enough food to survive and even then it's only through hard work and ingenuity that they can provide for themselves and their families.  Because of an uprising, the Capitol has instituted The Hunger Games.  These "games" take place each year and each district is required to send two teenage participants aged 12-18, one male and one female.  The participants, called tributes, from each district are taken to a previously undisclosed location and required to fight to the  death.  The last tribute alive is declared the victor and returns to his or her district not only with the honor of winning, but also with the reward of being financially "taken care of" for the rest of their life...being put up in a great home and provided with money, food, etc to ensure their comfort.  Our protagonist, Katniss, becomes the female tribute from District 12.  The premise itself is an intriguing combination of a number of elements I've seen and enjoyed from other books and stories.  The system of selecting the tributes reminded me of the short story The Lottery.  The general layout of Districts and order of government reminded me of a variety of 'end of days' books.  The fight to the death concept reminded me of  ancient Roman gladiators or other similar events where participants are required to kill each other at the whim of the controlling government.  While these elements were familiar, the way they were put together made the story fresh and enticing.  The language was fluid and engaging.  The target audience is teenagers or young adults, so I expected a fairly easy read.  At the same time, the author didn't "talk down" to the reader in any way or pull her punches.  On the contrary, she accepted the reader as an equal by providing a quick, smart, tight narrative.  Some of the characters were a little flat, but that was mostly only true of some of the almost faceless tributes that Katniss encounters or the nearly caricaturized people she meets once she arrives in the capitol.  I thought the overall characterization was done very well with the exception that through the first few pages (either due to writing or due to my reading too quickly), I thought the narrator was a male rather than our female protagonist.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed the characters.  The world that was created was also very intriguing.  We begin in District 12 and specifically within the Seam which is the poorest part of the district.  While the language and descriptions were fairly modern, the overall feel of the district could easily have been late 19th or early 20th century.  Only small evidence exists that we're in modern (not even future) times such as the electrified fence surrounding the district.  As we learn more about the community, it's evident that some industrialization has happened since there is talk of trains and other motorized vehicles.  But it takes quite a few pages before we're fully aware that we're in an "advanced" future complete with hovercrafts and large scale projection screens that can cover the sky.  I loved the juxtaposition of the poor and degrading District 12 alongside the decadent effulgence of the highly modern Capitol.  Truly it was as amazing to the reader as it was to Katniss just how different the two disparate areas were.  It also spoke well to the hypocritical and contradictory nature of those governing the land.  A theme that became a strong thread in the book.  The intrigue and potential conspiracy or collusion was a lot of fun to follow along and was very compelling to me.  I was hoping for more of it, but the man vs man battle of the games didn't provide a ton of opportunity for this.  I expect a bit more plotting and scheming in the next book.  The actual Games was a fun adventure.  The preparations leading up to the games were rather interesting as each tribute was presented to the world and then trained and prepared to fight to the death.  I loved following Katniss through the strange terrain.  Again, we were pulled back into a non-futuristic world as the kids ran through forests, streams and mountains.  At the same time, we were frequently reminded of the high-tech society whether through the projections in the sky or the high-tech gadgets and medicine provided to the kids.  One of my favorite elements was near the end when Katniss encounters the muttations.  I really liked the depth and intrigue of those creatures.  If you can't tell by now, I really enjoyed this book.  It was a fairly quick read that didn't get too terribly deep.  And yet, it provided plenty of food for thought about the way we deal with those around us, the things we take for granted and the things we overthink.  It provides a fun and intriguing social commentary worth thinking about.  Probably the biggest downside for me was the way it actually ended which isn't a super tense cliffhanger but still leaves you intently wondering what's going to happen next.  Fortunately for me, the second book is already out so I won't have to wait ages for it to be written.  For those who hate cliffhangers, don't worry too much...the Games come to an end and most things are wrapped up.  The "cliffhanger" has to do with some of the events that happened in the Games which have the great potential to instigate change within the Districts and the Capitol and which are poised to explode shortly following the final page.  Definitely recommended.  Enjoy it.  *****  4.5 out of 5 stars
Before starting the book I didn't let myself read any other reviews so that I could create my own opinions of the story. I hate to know too much before I start. For this reason with movies I like to only see a preview once or twice so I can be more surprised by the actual finished product. Although I enjoyed the book it didn't go as quickly as I thought it would. The first time I picked it up I only got a few pages and then put it down and read a few other books. When I picked it up the second time I got into it right away. While I understood the premise of the Hunger Games I also had an inkling of the outcome because this book is the first in a series, it might have been better to have it be a stand alone novel. Also, I didn't care for the open ended way it ended. I know it needed to be left open for the next book, and I am lucky that I waited this long to read the first since now I can move right on to the second, but it reminded me a bit of the openness of the endings for the Fever series by Karen Marie Moning. Like the end of a season of a tv show that leaves you hanging so you'll tune in again in the fall. To me, if the writing is good I will go back for more by the same author and about the same characters even if I am not being teased by a cliff hanger. Perhaps with YA books this is more common to keep younger readers hooked.  The story this first called to mind for me was "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson. Usually when we think of having our name chosen from a bowl winning is the desirable option, but in both of these stories it is what everyone is crossing their fingers hoping against. Kind of like sacrificing virgins to the gods hoping for favor, they seem like pointless rituals from the outside.  Haymitch, the advisor to Peeta and Katniss, the two tributes from District 12, is described as frequently being drunk. Haymitch was the winner of the Hunger Games many years before and I wondered if his alcohol abuse could be tied to the horrors he experienced and the kills he may have had to make as a player in the game. How much of themselves do the tributes give up in order to survive? Is it better to die yourself or to compromise what you believe in to win and make things a little better for your district? Do the winners lives ever go back to normal? If not should they want them too since starvation and hardship seem to be the norm? Will there be a way for the winners to share whatever they have earned by winning with their district and should they even be asked to? I also wondered how the rules worked for winners- would their names continue to be put into the lottery if they were under 18 or would they be dismissed for their prior service?  I admired Katniss for stepping forward to take her sisters place and for using what she had learned poaching in the woods to keep herself alive. Peeta's enduring love was encouraging at a time when they had so little. The alliances that were formed in the arena reminded me of "Survivor" especially in that they turned on each other and had ulterior motives for teaming up. I really had an issue with the people living int the capital. If they had so much why couldn't they share to keep people in the districts from starving? Did the people from the districts ever had the chance to more to the capital or did you have to be born there? If the wealth was shared and the fences removed would there even be a cause for the people to rebel again? Some great issues were addressed in this book. Whenever a story inspires so many questions I think of it as a good book for meaningful discussions.  I will definitely be reading the next book, "Catching Fire" to see where Collins takes the story!
Fantastic in every aspect!! A must read!!  This is by far my favorite book!! Suzanne Collins has created a book that will capture the interest of anyone, of any age, male or female.  She creates a novel that has the perfect balance of thrill, suspense, romance and rebellion that will suck the reader in, and keep them on their toes, all the way through to the end.  This book can not fit into any single category, because of all the different aspects that it encompasses, which makes it perfect for nearly each and every reader.  Not only did I thoroughly enjoy this book as simply a pleasure read, but it also got me thinking about the Utopian, to dystopian society, that it portrays.  In this futuristic society, after North America has destroyed itself, the country of Panem is what rises from the ashes of our broken world.  The Capitol, a shining city situated in the Rockies, is in control of the 12 districts of Panem, which are all extremely poor underfed, and ill-treated, each specializing in certain goods to maintain the elegance and luxury of the self-centered citizens of the Capitol.  These Capitolians spend their lives making themselves happy in a world where they are surrounded by highly advanced technology which has few limitations, while the people of the districts live a life nearly as bad as the people living during the Great Depression.  Naturally the citizens of Panem saw this as completely unjust and crul, and rebelled.  Because of their weak defenses against the Capitol, they lost by an incredible margin, and earned themselves The Hunger Games.  Each year a girl and boy tribute from each district are chosen to be thrown together into a massive outdoor arena, to kill each other.  The last one standing earns endless riches and fame.  The entire event is broadcasted around Panem, where in the Capitol people consider it the ultimate form of entertainment.  The games are mandatory viewing, serving as the cruelest of reminders of how much control the Capitol has over the districts.  There may be some turn-offs to people when they first approach the book.  One being, the book description on the inner panel of the book jacket, which gives the impression that the story is strange and is centered mainly around violence, while in actuality, a lot more happens in the arena than just killing...  Collins shows in depth the bonds that are formed through different realationships with family members, friends, lovers and even some unusual and fascinating animals.  I have a copy that I keep for myself, and another that I lend to other people, my mom, step mom, and her mother have all read it, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I have never come across a person who hasn't enjoyed reading this masterpiece that Collins has created!
As I have mentioned before, I am often found reading the forums on [...]. I also keep up with my Google Reader - all of the bloggers and readers in both places raved and raved about The Hunger Games. I did not know the plot summary or anything about the author. I did not know it was part of a series. I did not know when the book came out. Basically? I knew nothing except that everyone loved it.  I decided that maybe I should read this one, so I put myself on the hold list at the library. I wait several weeks, and find out it's on an inter library loan and was due weeks ago - which means it's probably not coming back anytime soon. I posted this on a Paperbackswap forum while I was talking about what I was reading at the time, and one of the members on there generously offered to read both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire (the sequel) and send them to me!  YAAAAAYYYYY!!  As soon as they came in the mail, I started to read. Luckily, I had originally planned on having a lot of time to read that weekend.  It took approximately one page to suck me in. Collins does a great job of telling the story while making sure you have enough information - and there really are a lot of things you have to learn. If you skipped over the plot summary above, you should go back and read it - it does a better job of explaining what goes on in the book than what I could. The characters are ones that you connect to, and the events that happen are so unexpected you find yourself wondering what's going to happen over and over again. One of my favorite parts is that everything doesn't just happen for the good of things - just because you start liking a character does not mean that everything will go the best way for that person, which makes it a very intense read.  I ended up liking it so much I immediately recommended it to my fiance, and he read it all in one day - he loved it too. My recommendation is that you get your hands on a copy of this book!  Book Cover: 9/10  Book Title: 9/10  Plot: 10/10  Characters: 10/10  Ending: 9/10  Overall: 10/10
One major conflict of The Hunger Games is the fact that there can only be one winner from the annual Hunger Games.  Each of the 12 districts must send one male and one female to compete in the Games.  Each competitor must fight for survival because the last person standing is the winner.  Katniss Everdeen, from the twelfth district, begins to like and admire Peeta, the male competitor from her district.  She realizes that she and Peeta could be the last two finalists and she would have to kill him or be killed herself.  Near the end of the competition the Capitol decides there can be two winners if they are from the same district.    I would compare Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games with Tobias MacIvey from A Land Remembered.  I think that these two characters would get along because they are both hard working people.  Both of these characters had many challenges that they had to overcome.  These two characters would have helped and encouraged each other during the most enduring of circumstances.  Neither one of these characters would have allowed the other to give up on any task.  The bad side of this team would be the lack of common sense to stay out of trouble.  These two characters would most likely hurt each other while attempting to survive the daily challenges of hard lives.    The Hunger Games is a thrilling and suspenseful novel that keeps the reader wanting more.  Suzanne Collins has done an outstanding masterpiece for young and old readers alike.  Winning means everything, including your life.  Competitors fight to the death, using inventive ways to terminate each other.  Who will win, who will die, let the games begin.    I would recommend this book to someone else.  I would recommend it because it is a very thrilling book that never gets boring while reading it.  It always keeps you wanting to know what is going to happen next in the story.  People who would enjoy reading this book would be people that like a lot of action in their books. There is always something interesting happening in the book.    The Hunger Games is about survival.  Each competitor must use their smarts and their strengths in order to survive.  This book makes me realize that body strength does not mean you will win. You must stay focused and use all resources available in order to succeed.  Even when you think there is no solution, sometimes you need to have hope and faith.
Welcome to the future, Suzanne Collins style. It is not a place I would want to visit, in fact her view on our future world had me shivering under my bed sheets. This book scared me and that is no small feat, since the last book that had me scared was Communion by Whitley Strieber and it was supposed to be a true story - hence the lights on for a month (did I mention I read that book when I was 12?).  The story is so well-written and gripping it had me believing that this was possible and in fact could be on the verge of happening. I actually shed tears throughout this novel and read it so quickly that I surprised myself. If I wouldn't have had a birthday party for an aunt this weekend, I would have finished it in a day - I tried smuggling it in my purse to maybe read there - but it was a no-go.  The Hunger Games is a depiction of life in the near future where the former North American continent is ruled by an unforgiving society that holds its surrounding districts in contempt with a chokehold grip. The story follows Katniss, a citizen of District 12, the poorest district in Panem. Katniss has one mission in life and that is to provide for her family. If she doesn't bring home food, they will starve.  The Capitol, the ruling body of Panem has other things in mind for the children of the districts - it is called The Hunger Games.  Each year there is a reaping, 2 children ages 12 - 18 are taken from each district, a boy and a girl - they are forced to fight to the death in a reality tv type environment.  This story is gruesome, touching, thought invoking...you name it's got it.  I was so entrenched in the story that I stayed up way past my bedtime finishing it and then moving on to Catching Fire, which is Book Two.  I'm thinking about reviewing Book Two, but just the description would give away spoilers that would affect the reading of The Hunger Games. Let's just say book two is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the first. I was sobbing...sobbing throughout half the book!  I have been reading a lot of phenomenal books lately and have been loving every minute of it! My hat goes off to Ms. Collins - remarkable job. I'm hooked and am in desperate need for even a synopsis on the third book!
Amazon Book Review  Trey, Trent, Ryan  11/18/09  Hunger Games  Author Suzanne Collins is the writer of the acclaimed bestselling Underland Chronicles. In one of her more recent books, The Hunger Games, she continues to explore war and adventure.  The Hunger Games is a terrific work of literature that is set in a post-apocalyptic North America known as the country Panem. The Protagonist is a sixteen year old girl by the name of Katniss Everdeen. She lives in District 12 better known as the Seams. Katniss is a huntress that loves to do what she does. Her mother is a single parent who seemed to give up on life after her husband, Katniss's father, passed due to a coal mining accident. Her little sister Primrose, age 12, adores Katniss and the feeling is mutual from Katniss's eyes. Katniss protects her family and takes care of them as if she is the "man of the house" since her mother has become dreary. Katniss hunts with her best friend Gale who is also a great hunter. They claim their caught game and trade it the black market referred to as the Hob. These skills come in handy when Katniss is entered into the Games.  The actual Hunger Games were a sign of punishment created to remind all citizens of the past rebellion. Originally there were 13 districts; all thirteen rebelled against the Capitol of Panem. The Capitol retaliated by destroying District 13 and creating the Hunger Games. In the games, there are twenty-four contestants two from each district who fight to the death to be victorious with glory, fame, and fortune. Prim is chosen but Katniss volunteers in her place leaving Katniss and Peeta Melark chosen from District 12 to participate in the Hunger Games. Both go through a lot of fierce competition but befriend one another. Soon they become closer and this piece of literature adds a little romance to its violence. The Hunger Games is a book that is very enjoyable to read and also one that keeps the reader on their toes.  "Winning means everything. Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun..."
I just finished Hunger games minutes ago and I feel like I have just been let in to a secret club.  Seriously.  I have read reviews on Hunger Games for months now and wondering what all the hype was.  I entered a few contests to win it, and did not.  I did however win a copy of Catching Fire and I knew I had to read Hunger Games first so I bought it last weekend and started it yesterday.  This is a book that by cover alone I would never have picked up.  The title?  Nope.  Reading what it was about?  Still a no, I couldn't imagine myself reading on a topic of young kids fighting to the death.  Even after I picked the book up and opened up to the first page I still am having doubt.  What if I am that one person that just cant get into this book?  And then I started reading....  and in no time, I loves Katniss and her strength and her love for her family.  I love Prim in all her youthfulness and sweetness... still mostly untouched by all the harshness of all this world that I have just entered.  I could hardly put it down.  You know the type.  The book that you can hardly stop to eat dinner for.  It traveled with me everywhere the past 48 hours.  In any spare moments I had, I read.  I don't know what I can say other than I loved this book!  It is so well written that I have a list of people who I feel must read it.  I have to tell my book club about it.  I am not sure who to pass this book on to next because the selfish book lover in me is thinking, what if they damage it?  What if I dont get it back?  I seriously am treating this book like a piece of gold I just discovered.... a book of much worth.  What am I reading next?  As I type, I have Catching Fire sitting next to me.  It has to be next.  I have to know what happens next.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins    Review by David Kelley  Katniss Everdeen runs from her starting spot. She sees the tributes fighting for supplies. As a boy is stabbed in front of her she sprints toward the woods. This scene takes place in The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. This is a fiction book with 374 pages. Someone should read this book if they are looking for an easy book that is filled with action.  The Hunger Games is a story that takes place in the ruins of North America. For the game two tributes are chosen from each of the twelve districts; the twelve districts belong to the nation of Panem. The tributes are sent to the capital to be trained for the game. Then the tributes are put in a large arena with a forest and lake. The tributes have to fight and kill each other until there is only one tribute alive. The games usually last for many days.  Katniss is a tribute this year who is playing in the game. Her sister Prim had originally been chosen, but Katniss volunteered to save her younger sister.  Now Katniss has found herself in a game where she will be playing for her life. Katniss is really skilled when it comes to survival techniques. She Lives in district 12 which is the poorest district, and it doesn't have a lot of food for everyone. Katniss has hunted for food in the forest outside the nation for a long time, and she has leaned how to survive in a forest. Katniss is also skilled in archery from her experience in hunting. She will have to put her skills to the test to win the game.  This book is really worth reading. I would give this book a ten out of ten. Suzanne Collins is very descriptive in her writing, and it is easy to visualize all of the scenes in your head. Someone should read this book because it is filled with action and has an intense plot. This is an extraordinary book.
Took me long enough to read this one, huh? Gosh, and what was I thinking to prolong it? I actually read this right around the big hype for Catching Fire - and I was even a bit intimidated to start it. I actually started reading it and put it down after a chapter or two (for like a day) and then I picked it up again and never put it back down until I finished it... and then I was still freaking out because I just wanted more. Luckily for me Catching Fire had just come out and I ran to my local bookstore and gobbled that one right up too.  For those of you who don't already know, here's a quick summary of the story so you sorta get the gist of it. Katniss Everdeen is 16 years old and resides in District 12 with her mother and sister. District 12 is the poorest district in Panem (a/k/a what remains of the United States). Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and as punishment they must now choose two young tributes (one male, one female) to represent their district in what is known as THE HUNGER GAMES. Meaning 24 children will have to duke it out on live television using whatever talents (hunting, archery, strength, etc.) they have as their weapon. They will be placed in an arena that will constantly be changing with all sorts of unforeseen dangers as well as these other deadly combatants and will basically have no option but to kill or be killed.  For Katniss and Peeta (the two tributes from District 12) - this will be no easy feat. For it's every man for himself and any feelings for each other can only be seen as a weakness. With no one to trust but herself and her instincts - it is up to Katniss to do her best and survive for the arena is ready, the tributes are deadly, and the cameras are watching...let the games begin.  Katniss, although not always the most likeable of characters, is a force to be reckoned with. I have never been so taken in by a character before. The danger lurking at every corner, the fear, the worry - it is all so real. Peeta, although only the baker's son, is also smart and cunning and you can't help rooting for them from the start. I went through so many emotions while reading this. It was like an adrenaline rush. I will even confess that there was a time or two that I actually found myself jumping in my seat (I know, don't make fun of me) from the excitement.  In closing, I will say this: This book is simply kick ass! If you don't already own a copy - do yourself a favor and get your hands on one pronto. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed.
I almost did not read this book because of the idea of people hunting people, let alone kids being forced to do this. So, I have to thank Krista for convincing me to read this book. If it was not for her I would not have picked this book up at all. Once I started reading this book I realized it is not as harsh as I had anticipated, which I am thankful for, and was not able to put it down. (I read this book of 374 pages in two and a half days, which is extremely fast for me.) Most of the book is not even set in the actual arena of the fighting. This book is more of the survival of Katniss and Peeta who are on the defensive and trying to stay alive. There is no cannibalism nor is it gory or brutal. I am very glad I did not pass this book up any longer.  I know there is a lot of talk of this book currently, which may be due to the second book recently being released. So with all this amazing praise I had to read it. Which was also a fear to me that with all the hype I would have higher expectations and the book would not measure up. Well, the book exceeded my expectations tremendously. Let me just say the praise is well deserved.  You meet Katniss here in the beginning right away. She sneaks past the fence around District 12 ment to "keep the animals of flesh eating out" and the citizens are not aloud to go outside the fence. Katniss has a spot she sneaks out and meets her friend Gale to hunt. See, they don't get caught or in trouble because the Peacekeepers of the city look the other way, as they like to eat meat too. Katniss has been trained at a young age by her father to hunt, and this is what Katniss has done to help keep her family alive after her father passes away in a mine accident years before.  Also, in the beginning you learn of the history of Panem, and how the Capitol has a gripping control over the 12 different Districts. As a lesson for trying to over throw the Capitol years past the Hunger Games came to exist. All the people are forced to have their children entered in the contest starting at age twelve through to eighteen, no matter stature or standing in the District. However, the poor children could very well have more entries than the richer. See, if the family is in need of food rations the child can enter an extra name in the drawing for this and you can do so for each person in your family. So with Katniss, she has a sister and a mother along with herself - this would be three more entries along with the one for this year. Oh yes, the entries are cumulative, so they carry over each year. That would get scary after a while.  On the day of the drawing all the people of the District are required to be there to witness this, and as a reminder. Katniss is shocked when her twelve year old sister who only has one entry gets picked as the girl to go to the games. What would you do for your sister? Would you sacrifice yourself to take her place? Well, that is just what Katniss does, volunteers to go in her spot.  I am surprised with the extent the Capitol goes to, to try and make this an exciting game to watch. The Capitol actually seem to enjoy this. The publicity the winners of the drawing get is unbelievable. There is lavish foods, complete make-overs, parades, and interviews. They are treated like royalty. People chant for these poor kids and bet on them. All this before they are sent to the arena to fight for their lives. The suspence is held through this section and there are peaks and valleys through here. My heart felt for Katniss and Peeta (the boy who won the drawing in District 12 with Katniss). Even the interview has a shocker to it. They need to win the love of the people in order to have sponsers to supply them "gifts" while they are in the arena when needed. The contenders all have to go through a training session for a few days then show their skills to the Gamemakers, which results in a scoring that could win them sponsers as well. All of these have their own peaks to them which keep you interested and driving forward in the book.  Then you get to the Arena where the game begins. Now, you are going to have to read the book to see what happens here. Just remember the people of the Capitol like a show and will do anything to get it... There are a few twists that get added along with new rules as they go.  By the end of this book I loved Peeta and Katniss. My heart burst, swelled, and broke with them through all their tribulations. Will they both live? Will one die? Will they both die? I am ready to dive into the next book Catching Fire. This book has told a story and set up for the next book at the same time, very well written in that respect. I also feel I understand the characters very well.  I have to say, for a Young Adult book I would suggest it to any and all adults to read.
Some reviewers are predicting that "The Hunger Games," by Suzanne Collins, will the next Harry Potter or Twilight Saga. It's not as original or well-written as the Harry Potter novels, but the set up for the book will probably appeal to young sci-fi fans just as much as magic and vampires do, and its anti-authoritarian theme will resonate with many readers.  The book's protagonist is 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a slum resident in a dystopian future America, now called "Panem." She's an isolated loner, with a dead father, an emotionally absent mother, a little sister she loves more than anything, and a platonic male friend who helps her hunt for food on a daily basis. In this future, the haves and have-nots are sharply divided among the rich, pampered government people who live in the Capitol, and everyone else who has to scrounge for food and other scarce resources (a situation with which I'm sure many of today's anti-government factions can relate).  In a plot device similar to the one in "The Running Man," every year the Capitol forces children from the slums to compete in televised death matches until the last person standing wins and is awarded money and food for life. Unlike many similar stories, however, "The Hunger Games" uses this setting to remove the main character from her regular daily life in order for her to process her feelings of alienation and resentment among strangers instead in her own family. Her new environment also helps Katniss re-examine her relationship with her mother, and develop empathy with people from different backgrounds.  Like all reality game show contestants, Katniss has her own support team that wants to make her look good. At first she disdains them completely, but becomes more open to them when she realizes her ability to survive the games depends in part on them. As the story continues, she is forced to ally with other contestants, and starts to empathize with them in spite of herself. Her participation in the games breaks Katniss down emotionally and physically,  and lets her repressed anger, vulnerability and longing to rise to the surface.  Katnisss attitude about the oppressive nature of her government is the most striking departures from so much of the young adult lit that is popular now.  In books with similar settings, like the Stephen King/Richard Bachman novel I loved as a teenage, "The Long Walk," the teenage participants blame unfair and unrelating adults for their predicaments.  In "The Hunger Games," Katniss bitterly places the blame on the machinations of government and society as a whole, which seems like a more insightful (if oversimplified) approach.  The growth and changes that Katniss undergoes during the games puts this novel in a better class than many similar speculative fiction novels, and her insights about her participation in her own oppression makes it a breath of fresh air compared with similar stories.  The action makes it a fun and easy read as well.
The Hunger Games is living proof that a book cannot be judged by its description.  At its simplest, yes, this book can be called a survival story.  There are, however, so many more layers to it all.  It is all about the human to human interactions as opposed to the human to environment interactions one would expect in a survival stories.  It's such a lousy summary to give, "A reality show survivalist story" when there's so much more to it all.  So I was skeptical when I first began reading, and it did seem to fall into that category.  I had a bit of difficulty, due to that fact, getting into the book.  However, once I found a good, quiet block of time, I sat down and read straight through and loved it.  It's all so suspenseful, as you really have no idea who will live and who will die going from page to page.  I made predictions, some came true, some did not.  Overall, I think the appeal to this book is the appealing personality of the main character and its ease of reading--I know 11 year olds who have read and loved this book.  It's easy reading, but once you go up the age scale, there's more and more depth to the overall story, making lots of real world connections to pitting countries against each other in brutal wars.  I was hoping to see more of this, the internal workings of the Capitol, some more background history (parts of the history they are fed seem veeery dodgy, and I'd like to know more), and I'm really hoping this is a vital point of Catching Fire.  I am also definitely hoping Catching Fire is about an overthrowing of the existing system, as well as more of the interaction between Katniss and Gale.  I'm getting more than a little sick of Peeta.  There were plenty of hints and clues along the way, and I'm hoping some of them (the pin, the ruins, Katniss's father's death, etc) come into play in the sequel.  Rating: 5/5
The Hunger Games is the first book in a dystopian young adult trilogy. The setting is Panem, a country of 12 districts in what was once the United States. To remind its citizens of their power, the Capitol hosts the Hunger Games each year. Through a lottery, one boy and one girl from each district are selected to fight it out until one only person survives.  The Hunger Games is intense and harrowing from the opening pages. The story is told from the perspective of Kitniss, a 16-year-old girl who had taken on the responsibility of hunting to feed her family after her father died. Kitniss is simultaneously vulnerable and strong, and I really liked her.  Once I started reading, I could not put it down. When I did finish it, however, I had to give pause. While I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, it lacked the depth and message to truly make it a great book. I also found the romantic love triangle storyline annoying; it came out of nowhere. It wasn't timely, and it seemed out of character for Kitniss. Mostly, it bothered me because it was incomplete. The love triangle storyline wasn't fully engaged, and it's clear Collins used the storyline to set the stage for the next book. I love trilogies and series, but I like each book to stand alone if they're released alone. Harry Potter is the perfect example: it was planned to be a seven-book series, and the books build on one another, but each volume is clearly its own story.  The Hunger Games is a wonderful, engaging story, but it pales in comparison to my favorite dystopian novel, The Giver by Lois Lowry. The Hunger Games is definitely worth reading, but I'm not sure it's destined to be a classic. I also fully admit to having high expectations, both from reading rave reviews about this book and my own enjoyment throughout the book. Sometimes books are so engaging and enthralling, they can't even live up to their own projections. Until the last fifty pages, I was sure I would rate this book five stars, but once I put it down, it didn't quite live up to its own promise of greatness. I am eager to read Catching Fire, the second book in the trilogy. The movie rights for the book have already been purchased, and I think it will translate very well to the screen. I'm curious to see if the movie is shaped as a trilogy as well.
The Hunger Games or should I say The Awesome Games is well an awesome book. There is a girl who lives in the seam of District 12 who wakes up screaming every morning. Can you guess who this is? Her name is Katniss Everdeen. Her father died in a mining accident, which District 12 is mining district Panem. North America has changed through wars and Mother Nature has turned into Panem. Panem which is ruled by the Capitol which is just like NYC (New York City) nobody's poor everybody lives it up. District 12 let's just say the only way they live is to do illegal hunting in the woods. There is a sign on the fence that says all hunting is illegal but everybody hunts there. So during the drawing for District 12 Katniss sister Prim gets selected, but Katniss being the good sister she is to volunteer. Then for the boys, baker's son Peeta Mellark gets selected. When they are being taken care of by the peacekeepers Peeta's mom gives Katniss a cookie maybe it was on purpose maybe it wasn't I don't know. Then on the train to the capitol Haymitch who is taking care of Katniss and Peeta who won The Hunger Games is his normal self the drunk. Then Katniss says "Your advice doesn't help us, you're too drunk to help us." So Haymitch promises to stay sober long enough to help them. Then during the parade Haymitch tells them to get along and Peeta says "Can you hold my hand I am getting dizzy?" So Katniss does. Then during the viewing for the sponsors to watch the contestants bonehead Katniss shoots an arrow at the sponsors. Or was it a bonehead move I don't know. Katniss makes a friend named Rue during the games which is weird because the goal is to kill the other contestants. They really get along they blow up the big group of killers. Then sadly something happens Rue died and Katniss only hope is to kill the others. This is an awesome, action packed, suspense filled book. It may get violent, but it is excellent.
This novel has been out for a couple of years now and I have finally made the decision to give it a read. It has been on the top of my "to buy" list for a while now and seeing how I was running out of "must have" novels to read I gave it a shot. To my surprise this novel was fantastic and blew away any doubts of a bad read in my mind. As always I will try to keep my review as unbiased as possible and try to avoid giving away any of the crucial spoilers that we all hate reading about in reviews.  Hunger Games//  Katniss and her family live in Panera, a futuristic America that is split into 13 districts, and we see the hardships she faces. Katniss spends most of her time hunting in the forbidden forest to provide food for her mother and sister after her father's tragic death in the coal mines. Each year the government has a forced "Hunger Games" where 24 tributes ( two from each district that are teens from ages 12-18 ) are selected to fight to the death, where only one can survive. When Katniss's younger sister is called to be a tribute, Katniss volunteers to take her place without hesitation to face off against fellow district 12 tribute, Peeta, who is the baker's son.  The tributes are allowed to get help during their battles in the arena so they have to gain favor with the public. Katniss and Peeta's trainers come up with a plan to really attract the audience's attention and bring them into the lime light. For the first time ever in the hunger games two tributes will be a couple who will fight together until the very end. Katniss and Peeta's romance help them secure sponsors who are willing to pay the high expense of sending them help in times of dire need in the arena. Though this was a plot by their trainers, Peeta really does love Katniss and used it to tell her his true feelings. Katniss at first believes he is acting his part but gets a sense that Peeta really does love her. She uses the scheme to hide his obvious advances and to figure out her own feelings. It will take all of Peeta's and Katniss's wits, skills, and instincts to survive the arena and become the Victor! But who will end up winning?  This book was very well written and cleverly told to keep the reader very much entertained. The entire time I read this novel I couldn't put it down. This is like the gladiator for teens and it really creates a world that is almost believable. You can say it is a mixture of The Game and 1984 mixed up into one grand novel. It contains a complex romance that gets even more difficult for Katniss to understand as the days pass by and has loads of great dialogue ranging from serious to humorous. This has a little bit of everything to keep anyone entertained. Don't worry science geeks they even have flying vehicles and bioengineered animals that have been altered for the purpose of war!  The pacing of this story is excellent as you have your slower dramatic scenes mixed in with vicious acts of violence that just blend in so well you never have a dull moment. The author did a wonderful job creating her characters and making the reader hope and pray that they succeed. Every character has depth and personality, which make them stick in our minds even after we have finished reading the book. When you read a novel and can't remember half the characters when you are finished you know the book was not very good. Every single person in this story has a mystery behind them that is just waiting to be explored.  Don't let this simple yet complex story line confuse you. This is definitively a read for anyone over the ages of 12 due to its complex romance, humor, and bloody gladiator style combat. It crosses the gender barriers as it is not a girl or a boy book but both. It is hard to give a great novel a numerical value as people have different types of stories they love to read. I myself do not find non-fiction or investigative novels to be that entertaining and would rate such a novel lower then someone who might love them. This multi-platform novel deserves at least a 4.5/5 regardless the type of novels you love to read and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to escape reality and emerge themselves in a world of mischief and courage.  Hunger games will leave you craving for more as every word digs deeper and deeper into your mind and creates a world so realistic and intriguing you just can't help but to imagine what happens next. What happens to the Victor after the games? How do the families and friends of the fallen react? How does the public react? Thankfully the second novel Catching Fire has hit the shelves and you will not be disappointed as it is just as good and entertaining as the first!!!!  Note: This is my first review so hopefully everyone who reads it enjoys it. I plan on doing more here as well as my personal website (non-profit with no adds...I don't make money I just love reading and writing and hope to write my own novel soon) that I am having made at [...] if anyone is interested. For now I just have a temp website I coded and tossed up until I have time to make a nice one :) Cheers!
In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humaniy and life against love.  Things I liked:  -Katniss, I liked that she was the stronger out of the two (meaning Peeta)  -Rue, she and Foxface probably were my favorite of the tributes (other than the obvious)  -I am undecided if I am team Peeta or team Gale. I like them both but there wasn't much time spent on Gale, so maybe I will have to decide once I read the sequel.  -I liked that the action was spread out throughout the book. Often times I read something and it's just fluff up until the last 50 or so pages then it's just straight action.  -The book had a very Ancient Rome feel to it, which tied into the gladiator games they would have back then.  -The feel of this book kind of reminded me of Graceling by Kristin Cashore, could be because I just recently read it. But I liked the feel this book had and the world that was weaved.  Things I disliked  -It was a little slow to start, and I felt that there were some parts that were overly detailed and I got a little bored with them.  -Spoiler - I didn't like it that the rules of the games were changed after 70 odd years to allow two players to team up just to accommodate Peeta's survival and a love story. Now I love romance, and I in no way wanted him to die..but to me it's just too convenient. Not every book has to have a love story to be popular. The author could have just as easily created a way for the two of them to escape from the games. Throughout the whole time they are in the arena I kept wondering why no one hit a wall or something that the could escape over?  -I thought there were a lot of times where Katniss has flashbacks of times from her childhood, I liked a few, but I thought there were too many and it slowed the story for me.  -I kind of felt that Peeta's personality changed after Katniss and Peeta team up  - Spoiler - I thought that it was weird that no one seemed to mind that the other tributes were turned into some kind of dog at the end of the games. If I was watching that I would be like "What kind of world do we live in that this is ok?". It's one thing to make people fight to the death, but it's another to experiment with them and turn them into something other than human.  -I wanted to know more about what else is out there besides Panem. Maybe that is answered in the sequel.  Overall a really good read. Although it was quit violent. I am pretty squeamish and there were some parts I almost thought were too much, but that's just me. I'm interested to see what the sequel Catching Fire will hold. I give this 4 out of 5
WOW! This is a great book .I could not put it down. This is now my new favorite book. I rate this book a 4.5 out of 5 but would have to give it 5 because there are no halves on Amazon. I give it this because it was entertaining, fun to read, and there were surprises in it.    This story is basically about a country named Panem of what was once known as North America. There are twelve districts but use to be thirteen. District 13 had an uprising so for punishment to remind the districts not to do an uprising again, the capitol (head of everything) has a Hunger Games each year. They send one female and one male from each district to compete in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a blood thirsty match where all 24 tributes fight to the death, and the last one alive gets a life of ease, and losers die. The only rule is you can't eat the contestants.    The main character Katniss is the main character and lives in a town called the Seam with her sister Prim. At the drawing Prim is chosen to be in the hunger games, but Katniss takes her place instead. Katniss has to take care of her family because her dad died in a mining accident so her mom is depressed and won't do anything. One day Katniss almost died from starvation when Peeta who later gets drawn for the boy to be a contestant in the hunger games, gives his burnt bread to her and gets a beating from his mom after he gave her the bread. Katniss never knew why she felt like she always needed to pay him back.    I would recommend this book to anyone but not to younger kids because there are violent parts like, Poisonous bees, or werewolves. If this would be a movie I doubt it would be possible to get it to be pg 13.    There are some parts I do not like in this book. One reason is this book is written in first person because in the story it would be cooler to go around to the other contestants and see what they're seeing. But I understand why she would want to put it in first person because it would be confusing if it wouldn't be in first person. Also with every desperate part it seemed like every time Katniss was in trouble something positive happened like when she was thirsty she found a lake so she got water. Also Katniss was starving and found food. Another thing I don't like is that Katniss's personality can be annoying at times. The thing I don't like is the romance part is a little cheesy when she doesn't even want romance. The last part I do not like is the ending. I will not tell you the ending because I don't want to give it away. But the ending is not exciting and should be more exciting.    Even though there are negative parts, you should still read it because all books have bad parts! No one's perfect. But there are way more good things then bad things in this book. One thing...get the book! Read it! Get your friends to read it. When you read it give it a chance up to pg. 130 because part 1 might not be exciting as the second and third part. This is a great book!
The hunger games is about a 16 year old girl named katniss everdeen. She lives in the far future, where america was destroyed and a new country named Panem sprung up from the ashes. The diabolical capitol is rich and well fed, while the other disticts starve. The capitol rules by ravaging fear amoung the districts to make them obey. So that they obey twice as well, the make them send children to fight to the deaths in a massive arena. This is called the Hunger Games. When Katniss's sister is picked for the games, she bravly volunteers to go in her place. Now she must defeat sinister opponets who have trained her whole life for this if she hopes to come out alive. It was a great book, combining technology, science fiction, horror, love, and rebellion in an apocalyptic future. One of the parts I didn't like was when the evil competetor Cato was killed by the werewolves, and although they made it feel real, I am just not a fan of teenagers getting chewed up by mutant werewolves. One of the stongest scenes was when Rue died, they made that scene really powerful. I also like the idea of how the Capitol thinks that if they can dehumanize all of the districts, that they can control them easier. I don't think that would work, because If you can think like a man, yet fight like an animal then you would be two times as dangerous an opponet. I think Suzanne Collins made a bold decision when she made the book from 1st person perspective, because it supplies many strength and weaknesses. A strentgh is that then you can feel like you are fighting in the games, and another is that then you can really get to know katniss better. Some weaknesses are that then you can't get to know the other charactors as well, and that then anything that katniss doesn't know, you don't either. All in all it was a book full of suspence,thrill, and villany, a must read book.
My impressions:  1.  The book immediately reminded me of the TV show "Survivor." Except kids are to kill kids and death is the only way out of the arena.  2.  Children often carry the brunt of the misery in a dystopian young adult novel. Their endangered well being is a visible warning to adults who might want to think on their own and might want to make the world a better place than what is available.  Readers need to know before reading:  1.  utopia vs. dystopia  2.  Speculative fiction  3.  Post-apocalyptic  Some questions I asked while reading:  1.  Why is there more to history than "they" are willing to tell us? P. 44  2.  Survival = killing and murder.  Winning = killing and murder.  Why these concepts are valued enough to be celebrated and televised?  3.  Why would the killings in The Hunger Games make the citizenry feel that there was no way to rebel?  4.  Why do the adults "just" accept this way of the world rather than put a stop to the slaughter to 11 children every year?  5.  Why in a "perfect" world, are there such distinctions between the "haves" and the "have nots"?  6.  Why do child warriors have to be gloriously dressed to impress the TV audience?  7.  How does being in the Hunger Games make an individual "someone" vs. "no one"?  8.  Why is it important to be yourself and to be true to yourself in order to win the Hunger Games?  9.  Why do the warriors have to "sell themselves" to the viewing audience if they are to be true to themselves?  10.  The children learn that "stupid people are dangerous."  Why would this be important to learn when being a contestant in the Hunger Games?  11.  Viewing the Hunger Games is a sport. Watching children kill each other is a sport. Why is adults killing each other in war bad if the Hunger Games are sport?  12.  Children are no more than pawns manipulated by the government. Why is this government allowed to exist in this nation?  13.  How important are alliances when you know that you will eventually have to kill them off in order to win/survive?  14.  What impact will winning have on the winner? What will their emotional future be like?  I have read the second book in the series and cannot wait for book three to come out!!!
"The Hunger Games" by Suzanne Collins was a wonderful book.  I immediately loved Katniss Everdeen, the 16 year old narrator who hunts and provides for her mother and sister after a tragic accident that took her father's life.  Katniss is strong, smart, and curious about the world.  She lives in a coal miner's village in a time in the future where the government as we know it is replaced by the Capital: a rich and very powerful group of people who dictate which districts perform which tasks and who will live and die.  Defy the Capital, and you will surely be punished.  Between giving your tongue, losing your already small rations of food, or death.  To express their power, the Capital holds annual Hunger Games where they choose 24 entrants (tributes) in total, two from each 12 districts across the country- ages 12 to 18 on a random name-drawing action. Depending on your age and the need to volunteer more "raffle tickets" with your name on them to provide more food for your family, your name can be entered as low as 1 to as high as 60 times per year.  Doesn't sound too bad, does it?  But these aren't average games.  They're called the Hunger Games.  People all over the country watch live footage as the tributes have to fight to the death.  Only one survivor is allowed.  The bloodier, the better.  The tributes are in training for about one- two weeks before they are thrown into an arena and expected to put on a good show.  Some kids are from district 1, which is loaded with rich and well-off people.  Some kids are from district 12, which is full of skin-and-bones people and lack of food.  But, in the Hunger Games- it is definitely survival of the fittest.  You either have to outweigh, out throw, or out smart the others to win the challenge.  If you don't win, you are dead.  Not only are you dead, but your entire family and village back home must watch as you are killed.  Picture the ancient times of the Colleseum, Gladiator, etc.  People are dying for entertainment, and to prove that the Capital is still in charge of your life.  "The Hunger Games" is full of twists and turns that I did not expect.  Human compassion is expressed very well, and so are the confused feelings of teenagers.  The book was very fast paced and full of surprises.  I was fully engaged through the whole story and obviously crave more when I was done.  Book 2 is on its way in the mail to me as we speak. :)
The Story Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins takes place somewhere in the future and in what we know now as the United States. But after some economical failures it has been separated in to 12 districts that are all "ruled" or regulated by the capital. The first district being right outside the capital and the 12th being the furthest, as well as the poorest.  Katniss who is the main character in this story lives in district 12, after her father died in the coal mine; leaving her mother helpless and incapable of supporting a family Katniss was obligated to take the lead role in keeping her family alive.  Every year they choose two people from each district (chose randomly) to participate in their annual Hunger Games, where all the contestants will have to fight and kill for their lives. And this year they drew Prims name, Katniss' younger sister. But if someone would rather volunteer they can take place of the person who was drawn, so Katniss takes the place of Prim to save her younger sister.  So once the games begin all 24 of the participants are thrown into an arena and are on their own to try and be the last surviving person. When there is about 8 of them left, they announced a new rule that if the two remaining participants are from the same district they will both win. Katniss then finds Peeta, the boy from her district. They pair up and will fight to win this years game!  I fell in love with this book, just minutes after beginning to read it. The way Suzanne Collins described Katniss made me have an instant attachment to her, and for me, being someone who doesn't particularly love to read, having an emotional connection with the story makes it so much more enjoyable to read. I really liked her writing; it was an easy read, but not something that an adult would feel childish reading. I think being able to write a book that can entertain almost any age is a huge accomplishment and says a lot about how good of a writer you are. Some of the violence may be to explicate for younger children, but besides that I think this book would reach the interests of any age group.
The Hunger Games is a novel by award winning author Suzanne Collins. This book was recommended to me by the dude at my local Waldenbooks store, and since he's practically my twin in terms of what we enjoy, I assumed this would no doubt be another excellent recommendation.  I know that it seems a bit fanboy, but I can honestly say that I was blown away by this book. I was in no way prepared for the story inside. Well, maybe a little prepared. The guy at the Waldenbooks did tell me that it was like Thunderdome for kids. I guess that should have tipped me off.  Katniss lives in District 12, a coal mining district in what was once known as the Appalachian Mountains. Each year, one boy and one girl from each district compete in the Hunger Games, a fight to the death that the Capitol uses to show its dominance over the Districts. Only one person can emerge victorious, and that person is then set for life. Katniss always worries about being chosen, about what will happen to her family if she is. District 12 doesn't have a reputation for winning the games, and Katniss, though just 16, is the main bread winner for her family. Things take a turn for the worst, however, when Katniss' twelve year old sister is given the "privilege" of competing.  Collins weaves an incredible post-apocalyptic young adult tale that had me spellbound from the first few pages. The vocabulary is at an appropriate level for younger readers, and yet the story doesn't feel like it's being watered down in any way. This makes for a quick and suspenseful read. Collins chose to use the first person present tense to tell the story, which I thought was quite interesting. At first, this bothered me, but eventually I think it led me deeper into the story, closer to Katniss' tale.  Katniss is fantastic as a narrator. Humble to a fault, and unable to trust others, her logic and thought process is interesting and slightly disturbing for a person her age.  I've never read another story by Collins, but if they're anything like this one I'll have to get the whole library. I highly recommend this book. It was my favorite book of 2008, and as soon as my local library gets a copy of the recently released sequel, Catching Fire you can bet I'll be all over it.  Final Score: 9.5/10 An quick read with an overarching story line that will easily span the three volumes of the planned trilogy, but with the kind of satisfying ending that rarely accompanies the first volume of a trilogy.  (less)
Oh what a story.  I found the dark realism of the story to be my favorite part. The truth is, I think that we could easily lead ourselves down the path to the world that Suzanne Collins created in The Hunger Games, no matter how horrifying and depraved it may seem. There is a ring of truth to everything that happens in the story, which makes it scary and believable.  The characters are pretty accurate too. I've read reviews complaining that the characters, particularly Katniss, were not very heroic or exhibited too much of a selfish nature, and I agree. She does. They all do. And I think it is irrational to think that anyone who wanted to live wouldn't do exactly what they had to do to make it...or they'd perish without being able to find a "fight" inside of them. The fact that these characters have to lose something of themselves just to get by day to day is one of the most powerful parts of the story. I do not begrudge the characters their choices. I'd have been suspicious if they had acted righteous and noble. Most people aren't. Sorry.  I read through the book in two nights, barely breathing, often shaking, crying at multiple points throughout the story. I think that the landscape is rich and the details well chosen. The story is scary in a way that I was not expecting. The kids involved in the games wounded me. It was hard to focus on any of them for fear of losing them. I would like to say that I can't imagine how it must feel to be in that society, in that situation, but thanks to the Hunger Games and my imagination, I can imagine it. And it is terrifying.  For those reviews I've read that complain bitterly that it is too much like The Long Walk or Battle Royale, I say, not really. There are similarities, but you can say that about more stories, that they feel like others. Just because the setting is similar, or how they got there is similar, doesn't mean this isn't a good book. The Long Walk frightened me and kept me on the edge of my seat when I read it many years ago, Battle Royale did not interest me at all. It is an individual thing, I think. If there is anything that The Hunger Games lacks it is that I thought there was a lot less blood shed than there could have been. The number of deaths we witness in first person are pretty minimal. Most of the competition is gone early. I might have liked to see more tense fights, more sobering, scary murders. But where it lacks in first person blood shed it more than makes up for in psychological torture. Psychological warfare is where Suzanne Collins shines brighter than any of the other similar stories.
Imagine living in a world where government rules all and freedom is not existent. Where simple necessities such as food and clothing are scarce. Where survival is one breath away from death. This is District 12.  In Suzanne Collin's novel, The Hunger Games, our world of today is no longer. Instead North America was demolished during wars and once they were over The Capitol rose and Panem was born. Thirteen districts were created. All were peaceful, accept District 13, they rebelled and because of that rebellion, District 13 was destroyed. Panem's soul purpose is "peace", having it's people accept whatever the government sanctions and not questioning it. Making it's people live in fear. Hence the annual Hunger Games.  Ever since the down-fall of District 13, these games have existed. Every year a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to participate in the Hunger Games. Two are chosen from each district and then thrown into an arena to kill each other. The last one alive, wins. Winning these games also means fortune and food. Which is something wonderful, seeing as most of the twelve districts are dirt poor.  The novel is narrated by Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old resident of District 12. She's a fierce protector of her younger sister, Prim. She's also an illegal hunter, doing what she can in the hopes of survival for her family. Her friend and possible love-interest, Gale, hunts and helps with her. Her sister Prim was the actual one chosen for the Hunger Games. But, instead of allowing her sister to go, Katniss intervenes and goes in Prim's place.  The boy chosen from District 12, is Peeta, the baker's son. He's nice, kind, and harbors a crush for Katniss ever since childhood. Katniss doesn't feel the same way, though during the games she plays along.  See, the games are a funny thing. They're all brutality, but they're something else. They're entertainment for the audience. It's reality T.V. at it's worst. Watchers place bets and sponsor strong contestants, (helping them when they are in desperate need of resources). So a basic note of survival is to play a long with a story tacked onto you from the beginning. In Katniss and Peeta's case, they played star-crossed lovers. Although, Katniss doesn't really need any of this backing, she's a survivor through and through.  It's a brutal book, and at times it's terribly hard to read because of the base line it has. Children not only die, but they are killing each other for glory. And yet, I loved this novel.  It's a book that shows both sides of the passed and future. What could happen if the government and the media ruled all. A very scary place. It has hints of the Roman Gladiator games. It even has a little Harry Potter (Goblet of Fire) feel to it, without the magic.  When I read something, it's very rare that I say I feel privileged to read it. But I say this whole-heartily, I feel extremely privileged to read The Hunger Games.  Suzanne Collins, you did literature well!
Once in awhile you come across a book that you just can't put down, you just have to finish it, and this is one of those books!  An action-packed but very layered and complex story about a young girl who is thrown into an arena where she is forced to face off with 24 other kids in a battle to the death.  Think gladiator but on a much larger scale where it seems the stage is actually a very vast land with mountains, valleys, rivers, etc.  Think Gladiator meets Survivor!  In the ruins of what was once North America there are now 12 districts, ruled by one capital, Panem.  Most of these districts are in very sad states, they just scrape by when it comes to food and other luxuries.  Every year, a boy and a girl are randomly chosen to compete in what the capital calls "The Hunger Games."  There can only be one winner in these brutal games where participants are thrown into an arena to face-off not only against each other, but controlled elements that the Gamemasters throw into the game (soaring to plummeting temperatures, fires, lightning storms, etc.)  These games are televised to all of the districts and each participant becomes a bit of a celebrity, able to pick-up sponsors along the way that may or may not help them when the game becomes too much to handle in the arena.  We follow Katniss, a girl from District 12, who volunteers for her 12 year old sister's place when she is the first girl chosen.  A person volunteering for another has never happened, and if it has, it has been very rare in these 74 years that the Hunger Games have been held.  Peeta, a baker's son, is the male counterpart chosen for the games.  Together, these two will need to eventually team together if one of them are able to even dream of making it out alive.  This is an amazing story and a very quick read for those looking for quick entertainment.  I highly recommend.  Be sure to check out the sequel, "Catching Fire."
What an awesome book. It's been a while since I've read a book that I lost sleep over. I couldn't put this book down. The way Suzanne Collins wrote just kept you in suspense. There was no time to dawdle just read, read, read.  It is set in the future in the US. The earth was nearly destroyed. The US was rebuilt into districts plus a capitol. It started off with 13 districts but they went together and rebelled against the capitol. The capitol won and district 13 was totally destroyed. So now there are 12 districts that live in fear of the capitol. Each district supplies the capitol with what it needs. One way the capitol keeps everyone in line is by having the Hunger Games. This is a game were a boy and a girl from each district between the ages of 12-18 is put in a arena and made to battle each other until there is only one living child left. That child is the victor and their district is supplemented a little better.  The book starts off in District 12 where the supply there is coal. There are many mining accidents and people often starve to death. There we also meet Katniss. She has learned to survive after her father died in a mining accident and her mother went into a great depression. She had to survive because the only person she truly loved was her little sister Prim and if Katniss didn't bring food to the table, it is possible no one would.  The day of the Reaping comes. This is where names are drawn from the districts on who would go fight. It turns out to be Katniss's sister Prim for the girl. Katniss has to protect her. How??? Read the book to find out!  I know some people are sensitive to children killing children and if you are one of those, you shouldn't read this book. The book did remind me a little of the Running Man and Lord of the Flies but I felt this story held it's own. I highly recommend this book.
So took me long enough to read this yeah? So this was weird it was exactly what I thought it would be but not at all both at the same time. I'm really not sure how to explain that though, so it's pretty much a useless statement.  I really enjoyed Katniss's story, she was a really strong and protective character. I would definitely say she was the way she was because of the circumstances of her life, her father dying when she was still a child and having to basically take care of herself, her little sister, and her mother in his absence. Basically her life of hunting and having to be the strong one in her family prepares her for being part of the Hunger Games. I liked that she wasn't a girly girl at all!  While I wouldn't say this is in a class of it's own plot-wise, (I've heard of other stories and short stories that share some common elements) it's definitely interesting and highly addictive. I wasn't certain how all these killings in the arena would be illustrated for a young adult audience but it's done in a way that's least offensive and least violent to most any reader, which I would have to say is pretty hard to do.  The games start with 24 teens and there can only be one winner. I was definitely hoping to get to know something about all of the competitors but sadly that wasn't the case. This is definitely wishful thinking but a chart of some sort with the competitors names, districts, score etc would have been so so so cool to see in perhaps the back of the book. But no, for the most part we only get to learn about a handful of the competitors and not very much about several of them. It's definitely Katniss's story.  Sometimes action and waiting for action bores me a little but this book did no such thing. It held my interest the whole time and I just couldn't wait to find out what happened. Truthfully the ending of the games was what I expected, but really what else could you expect right? But maybe that's just me. Overall a fantastic book and I'm excited to see where the sequel, Catching Fire picks up!
To be honest, this book shocked me. I'd been hearing nothing but great reviews about it from everyone, and when the online book club that I belong to selected it to read, I was happy to have a reason to pick it up. I didn't really know anything about it, just that everyone kept saying what a powerful book it is. And they aren't wrong.  The Hunger Games takes place in an undetermined future, in a country that is now known as Panem (once North America). Panem consists of the Capitol, the ruling city, and 12 districts surrounding the Capitol. Once, there were 13 districts, been during an uprising, the Capitol demolished the thirteenth district. As a constant reminder to the remaining twelve districts of its authority and power, each year the Capitol requires a pair of tributes from each district, one boy and one girl, be selected in a reaping and then be sent to participate in the Hunger Games, the ultimate in reality television; the Games are broadcast for the entire country to see. The idea is, each of the 24 tributes are places into the Arena, an ever-changing venue built each year for the Games, and they are forced to fight to the death, until there is only one tribute standing. That tribute's district is then honored for the next year.  Katniss Everdeen, 16, has been providing for her family ever since her father's death in a mining accident. Her best friend, Gale, has been providing for his large family as well. This will be Gale's last reaping. At the age of 18, he will no longer be required to participate if he is not chosen this year. Katniss' younger sister, Prim, barely has a chance of being chosen. At just 12, Prim's name will only be in the reaping once. However, when Prim's name is chosen, Katniss jumps to her defense and volunteers to go in her place. The other tribute from District 12, Peeta, helped Katniss years before, when she was on the edge of starvation, and she hates that she feel that she owes this boy and is still required to kill him if the opportunity presents itself.  Beyond this, I don't want to say much more, because any more that I reveal about the story will lessen it's impact when you read it. Needless to say, Suzanne Collins does not sugar-coat the necessity to kill your rivals in the Hunger Games. This is not an easy task for the participants, and Collins makes you aware of that every step of the way. The tributes are all very real, three-dimensional characters, each with their own agenda and tactics for staying alive. Collins does an amazing job of creating the conflicting feelings in Katniss; is it possible that she can be a good person, and a cold-hearted killer at the same time? Underneath the brutality and the crooked means by which the tributes are placed into their predicament, you can't help but feel pity for them; that they are forced into this situation against their will, and are forced to make such adult decisions at such a young age seems almost intolerable for them at times.  With a bleak and sometimes desperate story that is sprinkled throughout with glimpses of hope, Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games is a fast-paced, no holds barred thrill ride of a book, that will leave you literally hungry for more at the last page.
Author: Suzanne Collins  Pages: 374  Publisher: Scholastic Press (September 14, 2008)  Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?  In the ruins of a place one known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.  Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to death before--and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.  Wow.  Normally, I am not a sci-fi fan. But wow.  This book was the epitome of amazing, causing a whirlwind of emotions to swell within you as you read. There is suspense and danger, love and loss, and quite a lot of sorrow and agony, and sometimes it's so much to bear that you're really just not sure what to feel. But those are the makings of a great writer, and Suzanne Collins is certainly that.  It is very descriptive--without being over descriptive--and some of the battle scenes are gory. That's one of the great things, Collins is not afraid to show things how they go down. There is no mercy in this book, and that's what we need in today's YA.  Fans of Twilight will love it, haters of Twilight will gobble it up with relish. There is no bad side to this book, and I am desperate to get my hands on a copy of the second book.  Go out and BUY THIS BOOK. 5 stars.
(NO MAJOR SPOILERS)  Imagine two dozen gladiators -- brutal killers, merely for the sake of entertainment -- being selected to star in the reality show "Survivor." But forget voting your competition off the island, this contest of wit, strength, and endurance isn't over until just one heart is beating. This is The Hunger Games. Or at least this is what The Hunger Games would be at its finest, according to its producers. Instead, a national audience is forced to watch perhaps eight or so of the contestants, who have trained all their lives for this "honor," slaughter the other sixteen, who were chosen from a mandatory raffle to be easy prey. Some of them are as young as twelve. None are older than eighteen.  But only after the bloodbath do the Games really begin.  Had I read this introduction on the back of a book, there is no way I would have spent $17 on it. I wouldn't have even bought it with a half-price coupon. But because of so many others telling me the novel would be well worth my time to read, I am now the proud owner of two copies--neither of which is in my home at the moment because I talk the book up so much myself that I have to lend it out to one friend after another. Simply put: The Hunger Games is one of the best novels I've read in several years.  Why, you ask? Brilliant plot, excellent writing, and a clever, highly-likable protagonist. And for you fans of a good romance . . . when one will eventually have to take the other's life, think of the complications. This definitely isn't your typical love story, but it's a great one.  The target audience is young adult (ages 12-18), and I think a good majority of twelve year olds are mature enough to read it. But I would encourage a parent to read it first before their child that young picks it up. You'll likely enjoy the read yourself even if you decide your child should wait a year of two longer. However, I don't think many younger than fifteen or so will really see the depth of the story -- the subtle hints woven into it about how savage our entertainment tastes have become, and where they may end up if our humanity isn't kept in check. The author never says this, but the message is clear on nearly every page.  As far as content for younger readers, there isn't a single curse word in the entire book. Not one. In my opinion, that is the mark of a really competent writer. Even in life and death situations, Collins doesn't lean on easy crutches to portray the emotions of her characters. And I don't want to give too much away about the romance, but there wasn't a single line in the most intimate of scenes that I wouldn't let my own twelve-year-old read. The violence is definitely there, but gore is kept to a minimum. Remember what The Hunger Games is all about, however, because the rules are real: kill or be killed. And children do indeed die. I think it's fair to relate the violence level to that of the last three books in the Harry Potter series. But there are fewer emotional strings attached to most who die in The Hunger Games, so it isn't quite as traumatic.  Honestly, compared to the shocking material I often find in novels written for an audience as young as twelve, questionable content in The Hunger Games is really quite mild. I recommend it for just about anyone in the target audience range, and the novel is easily sophisticated enough for most adults. In fact, I rarely read books even half as riveting off the adult shelves.
Suzanne Collins'The Hunger Gamesis a young adult novel set in the future after the collapse of the world and its rebuilding by The Capitol. To maintain order, The Capitol hosts The Hunger Games each year in which 2 tributes--a boy and a girl--are chosen from each of the 12 districts to compete to the death. Once all other tributes have died in the arena, the winner is set for life in terms of food--in a world without much food--position, money, etc.  The heroine of this novel, Katniss Everdeen steps up and takes the place of her sister. She and her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark, are sent to The Capitol with their mentor and the last member from District 12 to win The Hunger Games, Haymitch. Once in The Capitol, Katniss and Peeta are groomed, presented, prepped, and molded to meet the television standards for The Hunger Games. The dynamic between these two tributes shifts throughout the novel, and in some case, like an undercurrent, it tips the plot on its ear.  Collins does an excellent job developing these young teens and staying true to the normal responses teens could have in this surreal world she creates. Katniss is a brave, but lonely girl striving to be noble, while Peeta struggles to remain the sweet boy next door and stay alive amidst the brutality of The Hunger Games. Collins' characters are well-developed, and readers will enjoy the outrageous antics of the drunken Haymitch, the superficial Effie Trinket, and others.  The Hunger Games is an amazing look at a post-apocalyptic world through the eyes of teenagers. Collins is a masterful young adult novelist, and readers will be quickly absorbed into the world she creates. Readers will grit their teeth, bite their nails, and shake their heads as Katniss and Peeta struggle to survive amidst determined, skilled tributes from the 11 other districts.  Collins goes beyond the entertainment factor of most young adult novels to depict real-life situations in which young love buds and confuses, alliances are made, lies are told, and truth surfaces when characters least expect it. The Hunger Games is not only for teens, but also adults, though parents should be warned there is violence and innuendo.  Thankfully, readers won't have to wait too long for the sequel, Catching Fire, which comes out in September 2009.
In a society where reality programming reigns supreme readers should feel somewhat comfortable with the main premise of this novel. The Tributes are but twenty-four tiny fish swimming in a barbarically dark bowl where morality is pitted against the basic instinct for survival. Readers are simply one of the outsiders looking in completely enthralled by the complexity of character and plot.  This book was spectacular in a myriad of ways not the least of which was the vivid imagery. Collins writes so eloquently that the reader is transported directly into The Seam where the District 12 lower class lives. We could smell the rancid air, feel the dirty grime on our skin, and hear the rumbling stomachs as if we were standing in the center of town ourselves.  The scenery was so clearly painted that physical locations became characters of the story as much as were Katniss, Peeta and the many people they encountered. District 12's darkness in contrast to the shiny brightness of The Capitol was so profound readers couldn't help but be struck by how misleading their characterizations really were. You see, while the citizens of District 12 were certainly suffering they were still inherently happy because they were together. On the other hand even though it appeared that The Capitol's populace was happy, that is all it was the appearance of happiness to maintain a State sponsored image.  Even so, the most compelling character of the novel is Katniss. A young woman of such an impressionable age she's faced with more than the usual pre-teen questions of what boy she should date, what fashions she should wear, and whether she should skip class or not. Here she was the breadwinner, doting sister, best-friend, coveted love and figurehead all at such a tender age. She's hot tempered, outspoken, strong-willed and, despite the vulgar circumstances she's thrown into, resoundingly tender and caring. Readers root for her from start to finish.  Surprisingly it is all of these traits that turn the readers eyes towards a focus on love. Among all this gore and savagery a great many people love Katniss. It is the love of her family that sustains and motivates her. The love of her best friend Gale that helps her fight to get back to District 12 to see if things aren't strictly platonic. The adoration and respect of new colleagues when Cinna and his team of publicists help transform Katniss into the image of whom she'll portray in The Games. Then most significantly the real and abiding love of a boy interested in her for more than friendship.  The beginnings of this love story are strung through a heavy and dark story. The trip readers take is not an easy journey but one that is well worth the effort. In forewarning readers need to be prepared to handle heavy themes. It questions morality and focuses on aggression as a way to not only punish but to entertain as well. Specifically, the actual Hunger Games pit children against children in a violent and brutal challenge for survival. Death is seen closely and described in detail on several occasions throughout.  In the end the reader will find that while themes are dark and sometimes violent the beautiful prose and characterization from which they are derived makes the ride edge of your seat exciting.
Why in the world it took me so long to read this series I do not know.  I LOVED it.  The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which humanity nearly destroyed itself.  The general public lives in poverty, barely scraping by.  They've been divided into 13 separate districts, each producing one major industries.  Recently, there was an uprising which resulted in the demise of District 13, which was eliminated by the all-powerful Capitol.  Katniss Everdeen is a young girl in District 12.  She and her family are barely scraping by by her slightly illegal poaching and selling of wild game to the hungry shopkeepers.  Such activities have made her an excellent shot with her trusty bow and arrow.  Her best friend and hunting partner, Gale, also supports his family in this manner.  Both Katniss and Gale have taken on the burden after the loss of their fathers despite being both under 18 years old.  When the annual reaping comes around, both teens are nervous, and for good reason.  Each has their name in the reaping bowl more than most children their age.  Once for each year over 12, and once for each tessarae, emergency food rations,  they have traded for.  Trading for extra entries in the reaping is a dangerous thing, for each year two tributes, a boy and a girl, are picked to go into the arena and participate in the Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games is a brutal, vicious fight to the death.  Two tributes from each district are put into a closed off arena and are made to fight to the death.  Out of the 24 children (all entrants must be between 12 and 18) only one may survive.  The entire thing is televised and the families and the general public are made to watch as the children kill each other, are killed by natural events, or die from injuries.  Some areas, like the Capitol, love the games.  In areas like District 12, it is greeted with much less enthusiasm.  This year, much to Katniss' dismay, her 12 year old sister Prim must have her name in the reaping.  But with one entry to Katniss' many, her chances of getting picked are slim.  Of course, one entry is enough to be pulled.  When Prim's name is selected, Katniss refuses to allow her to go and steps in to take her place.  Along with Katniss, District 12's male tribute is Peeta, a kind-hearted boy who saved Katniss from starving right after her father's untimely death.  The two are sent off to the arena to face the bloodlust.  Instead, they find an odd way to twist the Capitol's game against them.  This book was very well-written.  It had me wanting more at every turn of a page.  It was definitely a "can't put down" kind of read.  There was such creativity put into the storyline.  The story line was filled with a perverse sort of brutality.  The characters are well-written and complement each other well.  I just can't ooze enough praise for this book.  Definitely one of the best YA Fiction books I have read in a while.
My son is eleven and I have read to him every night nearly since his birth.  Some years ago we read the "Gregor the Overlander" series by S. Collins and loved it. It's a wonderful read. I'm nearly embarrassed to tell someone the plot and expect them to believe me when I say it's a wonderful series, but truly, that is the case. I recently discovered that Ms. Collins had written another series, a trilogy and bought the first book in that series; The Hunger Games.  This series is much darker than the Gregor series, and at times I've questioned whether it's appropriate for my 11-year old. I decided to press on, as kids get exposed to so much these days anyway (despite no TV in our home) that sheltering them from written violence really doesn't shelter them from the violence they hear about every day at school and other locales. Plus, violence in the context of a well reasoned and thoughtful book is much less "damaging" than what they're routinely exposed to despite our best efforts.  This book is absolutely en-captivating. It pulls you in from the very beginning and you simply can't put it down. The lead character, Katniss, is a complex mix of warrior and care-giver. She has been driven, by her devotion to caring for her family in a post-apocalyptic world, to learn the arts of hunting and survival. When her sister, Prim, is chosen as a Tribute for the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Her hunting/survival skills have prepared her well for her warrior role in the games. She's less prepared to understand and deal with her own emotions as she learns that others, like her fellow Tribute Peeta, put honor, love and ethics above simple survival. Katniss is continually torn between her distrust of other's intentions and her observations of what appears to be selfless giving.  I won't give away details of the plot. I will offer that whether the reader is an adult or a tween, this book is one well worth reading. For parents who are eager to instill a love of reading in their children, this book is a fabulous "tool" to achieve that end. My son would have me stay up all night long and read the book from beginning to end. As I travel a lot for my job, I even went so far as to install Skype on my computer (per my son's request) so that I can continue reading this book to him while I'm traveling.  Parents, if you want your kids to embrace reading, buy them this book. They won't be able to resist the story-line (and neither will you if you read it).
I read this book wherever I went. Suzanne Collins does a brilliant job setting the events in the book. My heart was racing because of the amazing details that were so in depth. It was an absolute thrill to read The Hunger Games.
