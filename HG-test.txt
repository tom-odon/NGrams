I have two daughters, age 8 (3rd grade) and 11 (5th grade).  This book is above my 8-year old's reading level and maybe just a little above my 11-year old's reading level, but it is certainly not too 'brutal' for either one of them.  Some moments are sad, some are thought provoking, but I think a lot of people underestimate what kids can handle.  I think a 6th or 7th grader interested in reading can probably read this story themselves.  I read the 'The Hunger Games' and have been telling the kids a bit of the story every evening at bed time.  The first night I told them the history of the Regions and Capital, the background of the main characters, and how they were picked for the games.  When I was done my oldest said, 'wow that's a pretty good story'.  Last night (3rd night telling the story) we got to about 1/2 way through the games and they begged me to keep telling the story.  Some bedtme stories put them to sleep, but this one keeps them rivited - and they have been getting ready for bed very quickly so they can hear it.  It's a great story, well-written (sometimes beautifully written), with memorable characters.  I highly recommend this book.  ***Spoilers***  My two bits of criticism:  -All of Katniss's kills were mercy kills or trying to save herself or someone else.  Her actions were almost exclusively 'good' and she was a bit one dimensional in that respect.  Her lying to Peeta about being in love was also done to save herself and him, so even that can be considered a 'justified' lie even if it was hurtful to him.  -The Capital held the hunger games to remind the Regions that they dominated by the Capital; so why does the Capital make decisions that pander to the audience?  Is the Capital in danger of rebellion by Capital citizens?  Perhapse the next two books will delve further into this apparent inconsistency.
I wasn't really expecting much from The Hunger Games,not even when I downloaded it onto my Kindle.I only did so cause I'd heard so many rave reviews about it~and cos I'm just a nerd for all things fantasy,I gave it a shot.  Wow,just wow.I was so blown away by all the characters that the ending came almost too soon.Just in case you have no clue what I'm talking about,the basic premise of The Hunger Games is this:It's set in America,but not just any old America.It's a futuristic version known as Panem,which is split into 12 different districts.Every year,a boy and girl tribute from every district are randomly selected by lottery to compete in The Hunger Games,where they will fight to survive in one arena.The rule is simple:kill or be killed.  What really struck me about this book was the way Collins potrayed reality TV and the audience's reaction to this sort of entertainment:just how far would we go to watch someone else suffer in the hands of the public?  Katniss Everdeen, our fiesty heroine and the book's narrator,is only in the Games after she volunteered to be District 12's female tribute to save her 12 year old sister Prim.Along as the boy tribute for District 12 is Peeta Mellark,who has had a crush on Katniss since they were kidsand who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving,something Katniss has never forgotten.In fact,this was the part of the book that interested me the most:In order to please the public,Katniss and Peeta must pretend to be "star~cross'd lovers".  I really enjoyed the book and feel that there was need for the violence in the arena scenes.It kept in touch with the grittiness of the plot,where unexpected surprises were thrown at us left,right and centre.I really liked the part were Katniss joins forces with Rue,a District 11 girl who reminds Katniss of Prim and what she has left behind at home.But without giving too much away,I hated what happened to Rue so much.She, along with Peeta, was one of my fave characters and I cried reading her part.  My verdict:I'd totally recommend The Hunger Games for anyone from 12+.It might not change your life but it will change your attitude to reality television forever.Bring on Catching Fire!!!!!
When I first heard about the Hunger Games trilogy, I was skeptical and even a bit angry, since the plot as it was described to me sounded identical to Battle Royale, which I have counted among my favorite novels for years.  After a few days, I decided to read and judge the book for myself, and I'm certainly glad that I did.  While the setup for the titular game of survival is quite similar to that of Battle Royale, there is enough original material here that Suzanne Collins could have easily reached those similarities by coincidence.  Overall, the tone of Hunger Games is quite different than Battle Royale.  Koushun Takami's 1999 Battle Royale feels like sociological horror, with all of its gore and shock value squarely focused on Japanese-centric commentary about youth in a dog-eat-dog, adult-controlled world with no room for individual freedoms.  By comparison, Hunger Games feels life a life-or-death adventure, where both you and lead character Katniss Everdeen must remind yourselves that all of her grand experiences are still leading towards one inevitable point, a fight to the last survivor against other youth just like her.  The Hunger Games actually holds more in common with the film version of Battle Royale, which most fans of the novel feel is vastly inferior to the original.  That's not to say that Hunger Games fails on the same points as the film, just that the two intellectual properties are actually quite different, and both still draw inspiration from material that far preceeded them, such as Stephen King's The Running Man and The Long Walk, or even Nineteen Eighty-Four before that.  In his review, King even drew similar comparisons, and while he agreed that Collins' novel was a compelling read, he gave the novel a "B" due to his criticism of her rapid-fire writing style (which he deemed "authorial laziness" when certain details got brushed aside by the quick pace of the narrative).  I tend to disagree with this assessment.  If one of Collins' qualities is to be commended, it's her ability to write in a cinematic fashion, giving the greatest attention and detail to the parts of the story she knows the reader will care about, while generally refusing to get bogged down in boring exposition.  This works to her advantage in most cases, since the story is told from Katniss' perspective, and Collins' cinematic writing conveys a sense of where Katniss' awareness is most acutely directed.  It also means that The Hunger Games could make a rare smooth transition to the big screen, as the film adaptation is due to hit theaters on March 23rd.  I would wager that, by this time next year, the entertainment market will be flooded with blu-rays, DVDs, video games, graphic novels, soundtrack CDs, and all sorts of connected merchandise, a phenomenon which is increasingly evident if you search "Hunger Games" here on Amazon.  Regardless of how you may feel about Collins' inspiration for the book, Hunger Games is definitely a triple-A franchise with a chance to make more people continue reading literature, just as Harry Potter and Twilight have managed to do over the last decade, though Hunger Games will no doubt hold more interest for mature readers than either of those series.
Katniss Everdeen isn't your average heroine. Don't take the hype for this book to mean that it is another overrated romance like Twilight. Bella Swan and Katniss couldn't have any less in common, which to be honest, is awesome. I had my doubts, since there was so much hype about it, but the first installment of the Hunger Games is a very compelling story that will have you furiously turning pages to the very end.  In the ruins of North America, the nation of Panem rules the twelve districts from the shining Capitol. Panem is harsh, enforcing their laws with a strict hand and forcing the citizens to engage in the Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games is a competition between one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts. The goal, to survive. The games end when only one lives. The games are a reminder from the Capitol and their leaders to the citizens of each of the districts not to rebel as they had in the past or end up destroyed like District Thirteen.  Each district is known for a product that they produce. District Twelve is the coal district and home to 16 year-old Katniss Everdeen. The mines are harsh and food is difficult to come by, and with the death of her father, life is even more difficult for the Everdeens. Katniss is forced to sneak past the fence surrounding the district into the forest to hunt and gather herbs for food with her friend Gale. Leaving the district is strictly forbidden, but the lax security in District Twelve allows the duo to leave unnoticed.  Their story truly begins on the day of the reaping. The annual Hunger Games is about to start and the reaping chooses the two tributes from each of the districts that are going to be entered. In some districts it is an honor to be chosen, in twelve, it is a death sentence. Each year from the age of 12 until 18, the children's names are entered to be chosen, one entry per year. At age 12, one entry, 13, two entries, consecutively until 18. The catch? For entering their name more times into the drawing per year and are awarded a tesserae, a years worth supply of grain and oil for one person, and the poorer the family, the more times a poor child's name is entered.  As the children of District Twelve assemble, Katniss Everdeen isn't worried about her 12 year-old sister Primrose, since her name has only been entered once. The name is drawn for the female tribute and Primrose was chosen. Before Primrose reached the stage, Katniss did the only thing that she could to save her sister's life, she volunteered to be a tribute, an unheard of event in District Twelve. The male tribute, Peeta Mellark, a 16 year-old son of a baker, and one-time savior of the Everdeen family.  As the tributes say their last goodbyes to their family and friends, the reality sinks in. One or both of them is going to die, and they may have to kill each other, leaving the tributes unable to forge a true friendship as they train to battle for their lives in the games with the other 22 tributes.  The Hunger Games was awesome. I give it 5 stars. It was extremely well written and the survival instincts of the tributes and their attitudes toward each other were engrossing. I loved the tension between Katniss and Gale as their friendship begins to grow into something else and between Katniss and Peeta as they attempt to overcome the idea of killing each other and forge an unlikely alliance and friendship between them. The small acts of defiance against the Capitol make the story extremely compelling. The auxiliary characters really enhance the story and you grow to care for them despite their small roles. I highly recommend this book for readers over 12. The violence is not extremely graphic, but is a huge part of the story and is suited for older readers.  Be sure to have the sequel handy for when you finish The Hunger Games, you will want more of Katniss, Peeta and Gale and their future adventures.  Check out my profile and blog!
I requested several books from the library and was on hold for a while and then I got flooded by a ton of them at once. I prioritized my reading list by due date &amp; by which ones couldn't be renewed. I landed on Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. I had heard RAVE reviews from several people but I wasn't too sure how I'd like it. I'm not too big into fantasy or sci-fi and most places I've seen this book have categorized it as such. In addition, it's a young adult book and while I think some YA books are ok I keep thinking at some point I might grow out of this genre. However, SO many people had recommend it I thought it had a good possibility of decent and when I read some brief summaries of the book it reminded me a lot of my favorite short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson that I thought I should give it a whirl.  I am SO glad I did. This book was AWESOME. If I had to summarize it in one sentence it would be "Imagine 'The Lottery' meets Survivor and they have a baby and then you have The Hunger Games."  First and foremost, while I can see why it's labeled fantasy/sci-fi, it is SO not typical sci-fi/fantasy. It's like the X-Men version of sci-fi/fantasy. Sure there are some things that are not realistic and far-fetched, but it's mostly grounded in reality and the things that are "unrealistic" are background mostly and don't really detract from the story. While post-apocalyptic style stories do intrigue me, I think they've been slightly overdone so I was hesitant about this aspect of the book. However, like the sci-fi/fantasy aspect, it's mostly background. It's the whole reason for the story but they do not dwell on it really. The story mostly revolves around the actual "game" itself (leading up to it, going through it and the aftermath) and that stuff was REALLY exciting and compelling. It was such a unique story I couldn't put it down. Literally. I read it in 6 hours with only bathroom and lunch breaks.  From the beginning it was hard to figure out who Katniss was. When I figured out she was a girl a while into the story (around page 14) I was a little surprised. As I read I had assumed that Katniss was a boy. This changed things a bit and made me a little more intrigued.  Besides the setting/environment, I really drew a lot of parallels with "The Lottery" at the beginning. However, after the story gets going it leaves that short story behind and moves on into a more Survivor like story but in a more serious way.  The best part of the book is the middle section once they are into the arena for the game. The preparation is interesting but I really couldn't put the book down once all of the contestants were fighting for their lives. I didn't see the "love story" coming, although it isn't misplaced or come out of nowhere but it wasn't something I predicted. It seemed very realistic and believable. Additionally, all of the struggles that the contestants had to go through in the game were also realistic and believable. Collins did a good job of creating an atmosphere of realism and I could definitely picture the setting from her words and imagery. One thing I thought was that the arena seemed bigger at the start of the game and seemed smaller by the end. Katniss journeyed forever on the first day and quite a lot on the second day but by the end it seemed like they could get anywhere in the arena in a few hours by the end. The complex emotions and personalities of the contestants was very interesting. A little Lord of the Flies but much more interesting and entertaining. The Truman Show parallels were also interesting to see. It's like Collins took some of the most interesting twists of all the above mentioned stories and wove them (very well) into this story. I don't mean to say this to make anyone think it's an old, tired story because they way she weaves it all together makes it fresh and interesting. I can just see some influences she may have had.  Although it seemed clear (to me) from the beginning that Katniss would win the game, you were still worried for her throughout the story and really rooted for her the whole time. The twist with bringing her and Peeta together was unexpected and nice. At the beginning of the game I was wondering how Collins would work that one out...although Katniss had some clear resentment towards Peeta I didn't know that she would be able to kill him unless something really drastic happened. I'm glad that the twist made that not have to happen. And because things got changed up so much throughout the story, even though Katniss winning seemed predictable, I didn't mind because the story kept changing so you were sure HOW she would win, and there was a possibility at several points that she MIGHT not win.  The one and only thing I didn't love was the ending of the book. The love story that emerged wasn't all that interesting to me, but mostly because I'm not a romance fan and particularly not in a YA novel. It would have been nice to end the book with a satisfying end rather than letting it linger, although obviously this left the end open for the subsequent books. I don't have a huge desire to continue the series, but since I got so involved with this book unexpectedly I am going to commit to the second book just in case it surprises me as well. This leads to a second tangent of something that I wasn't a HUGE fan of, although it didn't really detract from the story. Throughout the story I would forget that these "kids" were supposedly ages 12-18. They just didn't have a "teenage" voice. The characters were much more thoughtful and advanced than their supposed ages would seem. Again, their ages weren't really the point so it didn't detract from the story, but occasionally I'd reflect on it and think, no way, a 16 year old wouldn't be thinking about things like this. So it seemed a little unbelievable that they were actual young adults rather than young adult characters created by an adult author. But in terms of the overall book and story it was just a minor detail.  Overall I would suggest this book to ANYONE (over the age of 14 probably). I give it 5 Stars and would probably classify it as one of the best books I've read all year. I really, really loved it. Obviously loved it enough to write a review of it which doesn't always happen. Go get it NOW!
A Book Review of Hunger Games  By Harry, Grade 7, Yangon International School    Once every year, 24 individuals are selected and forced to participate in the Hunger Games, a brutal battle royal to death in a harsh, artificial environment for the entertainment of the Capitol. While victory leads to great rewards, no one thinks of the prize, as survival is their only goal. A story so outstanding that award winning author Rick Riordan has stated, "As close to a perfect adventure novel as I've ever read." Written with great action and suspense by Suzanne Collins, author of the Hunger Games trilogy, in 2008, Hunger Games is a book any fan of action and fantasy will not regret reading.    Katniss, the protagonist, lives in District 12, where she is part of the many poverty stricken families of the district. Katniss, her mother, and her sister, Prim rely on Katniss to hunt for food, but still barely manage, so every year; Katniss and Prim must apply for tesserae, a meager year's worth of grain and oil. While there is no monetary fee, for each time they apply, their names will be entered one more time into the reaping, a lottery to choose the boy and girl who will represent their district by entering the Hunger Games.  The possibility of being chosen never enters Katniss's mind, until Prim's name is drawn. Katniss immediately volunteers to replace Prim in the games. After Katniss accepts her role as the female tribute, the baker's son, Peeta, is chosen as the male tribute. Before the actual games begin, a lot of suspense is created. The plot is well structured and the story has a flow to it. Events in the story are well planned out and placed, and the change of life from poverty stricken to luxurious for the time before the games is well portrayed. The training scenes, the pampering, traveling, the characters' thoughts, all add depth to the story. As Katniss and Peeta enter the games, they face unimaginable threats and sorrow and difficult life or death situations. Ms. Collins' writing skillfully develops the action, as well as the behind the scenes mechanics, such as rules and training, costumes, and travel. When reading the book, a reader can feel like he/she understands the Hunger Games and the rules as if it were real life game.    Even though I felt that the book had too much death and gruesome topics, Ms. Collins provided detailed descriptions without being too graphic. Through her detailed scenes and portrayal of the characters' strategic thinking that Ms. Collins has developed an exciting balance between action and survival. The rising action is very well built and consistent, as it keeps the reader intrigued throughout the book. A lot of thought has been given to the actual battles which it draws the reader in, even if it's subconsciously. Katniss is a subtle, stealthy participant, and was not involved in big battles. Although I think that the book is excellent, I would have enjoyed a battle scene, rather than always the subtle methods used to survive. The theme of the book is survival of the fittest as the 24 participants have to fight to death. Another theme of the novel, government power and control, is more apparent in the series as a whole, but is also in Hunger Games, as it is implied that people despise the Capitol's ways and wants to stop them. The Hunger Games definitely has the feel of war. There are many strategies involved in the plot as well. The strategy of teaming up is shown throughout the plot as well as sneaking behind the battle and sabotaging, using signals, being resourceful. Katniss and Peeta pretended that they were star-crossed lovers in order to gain popularity from the crowd and the Capital, but I felt that the romance should stay outside of the action. I did not like the fact that Peeta, another tribute from District 12, is in love with Katniss.    I think that guys will enjoy this book more than girls, and that all ages older than 10 would enjoy this book. If one is looking for that exciting adventure novel to keep him/her on the edge of the seat, Hunger Games is the book for you. On a scale of one (low) and five (high), I give this book a five because although I would have preferred some things changed, the fact remains that this is an excellent read, and I enjoyed every minute spent reading it.  Perspective #2  A Book Review of The Hunger Games  By Amy, Grade 7, Yangon International School    Twenty four teens forced to play a game with only one rule; murder. Win and take all or be defeated and lose life itself. Discover an unforgettable adventure of a young girl's determination to survive in The Hunger Games, the first book of Suzanne Collin's trilogy. Collin's amazing work appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list for more than sixty weeks in a row, and she was named one of Time Magazine's most influential people in 2010.    Every year in Panem, a post-disaster version of United States, the Capitol would pick two adolescents from each of the 12 districts to participate in a cruel game called the Hunger Games. The rules were simple; kill everyone in order to win. This year, Katniss Everdeen takes her younger sister's place as one of the tributes with Peeta, a childhood friend. Together with 23 others, Katniss is thrown into a man-made arena without any preparations. Not only must she strive to remain alive from the unnatural wilderness of the arena, but also survive being murdered by the other tributes.    Just as Stephen King commented, ". . . I couldn't stop reading". The twists and turns of the story line made the tale unbelievably addictive and thought provoking. Collin's development of characters was so well-built that it lets the reader feel fond of them. The realism and differences of the personalities such as Katniss's and Peeta's cause the book to be believable. The suspense and thrill of the plot drew me more and more into the novel. Problems such as societal issues, survival matters, and betrayals occur in the book. By adding complications to these conflicts, the story compels the audience to read more. Collins managed to tone down the violence to the perfect level which added further excitement. Her writing also leaves hints and foreshadows of what to come which lets the reader feel enthusiastic for more. This story will haunt the audiences' minds.    The Hunger Games was aimed for young adults, but older readers would definitely enjoy it too. On a scale of one to five, I would give this book a four point five because I thought it was such an innovative and brilliant novel.
I've read the entire Hunger Games series twice, and I loved it the first time, but love it even more after the second read.  I think you do have to read it again to truly appreciate all that this story is.  I'll get to that in reviews of the other books.  The Hunger Games is a gritty story - it's not for the squeamish or faint of heart.  I initially resisted reading the series based on the idea of children pitted against each other to the death.  It is horrifying to consider, and it should be.  Katniss's character is well fleshed out and relatable.  Due to her circumstances, she has been forced into the role of caring and providing for her family, a burden no child should have to bear.  Because of the protectiveness she has for her younger sister, Prim, Katniss volunteers to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games.  From that point on in the book, it all breaks loose into a roller coaster ride that will leave you reading through the wee hours of the night just to see what happens next.  Side note - as others have mentioned, I also cried when Rue died.  Katniss showing the tenderness and compassion that she did for her friend, plus acknowledging the bread that came from Rue's district had me reaching for the kleenex box.  For parental concerns, I personally would not let a child under 8th grade read it due to the amount of violence it contains.  I think a child needs to be old enough to verbalize what they are feeling as they are reading, and this book in particular is ripe with potential conversations you can have with them about it.  There is no cursing in the book, Katniss and Peeta kiss on several occasions.  Katniss is stripped by her prep team as they prepare her for the Hunger Games, but it is only mentioned in context.  There is nothing sexual about it.  The biggest issue for me was the violence and making sure my child was emotionally ready to read something this graphic.  Be forewarned though - once you read Hunger Games, all other books in this genre will pale in comparison.  Suzanne Collins is unparalleled in her writing skills.  Some advice though, do read the series *at least* twice.  You'll be surprised at what you miss the first go around.
"I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me." -Katniss Everdeen  Rating: 9 / 10    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is the first book in a trilogy that details the conflicts of Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl who lives in District 12 in the Empire of Panem. Katniss must overcome impossible odds to survive in a kill or be killed competition known as the Hunger Games.    The book is fast-paced, focused, exciting, and an overall fantastic read for any audience. Collins does an excellent job of trimming away useless details and focusing on the Katniss's perspective. Her lean writing style creates a quick tempo and makes it hard for the reader to put down her story. I found myself reading at least 100 pages per sitting.    Collins is able to command a sense of the present. Almost all her tenses throughout the story are present-tense and demand a sense of immediacy. This style ensures the reader is immersed in Katniss's quick thinking and keeps the tension high.    Finally, Collins never allows a boring moment. Each chapter ends momentously and you never feel like you can miss a word because it all seems so pivotal. Collins keeps the reader on the edge of their seat, eagerly awaiting every word. The story was so engrossing that within the two days it took me to finish her first book, I immediately went and downloaded Catching Fire, the second book.    One of my favorite characteristics of Collins's writing is how clean the book was. I never found any language, romance, or violence to be gratuitous. The novel maintains a sense of brutality, but in the utmost necessary way. The story is riveting and pulse-pounding, but does so because of Collins's mastery of efficiency and pace.    To anyone that hasn't picked up this brilliant and fresh novel, Suzanne Collins has written a fantastic novel that will leave you breathless and hungry for more. In the ominous, booming words of Claudius Templesmith, "Ladies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin!"  If you like my review, read more at [...]  Happy Reading!
For winter break I decided to get "The Hunger Games" finally read after many urgings from my friends who were raving about this book. For the most part I was satisfied and my expectations were met; this is a really engaging, cool story with a neat concept about kids having to kill each other tournament style. I liked how quick of a read it was even though it's really long. I also got invested in the characters and what would happen to them, which means a lot in a book where a lot of them have to die!  The first person narrative was fun because it'd been a while since I read something that wasn't third person, and it got me to relate more with Katniss. It was difficult rooting for both her and the other characters in The Games.  The only thing I wish could have been featured more were more details on the other characters in The Games. I felt that sometimes they were killed off too quickly just to get them out of the way and focus more on the central characters in the competition. I'd have liked if there were more fights and kills that were explained, described or shown. I also felt like the ending was a little bit too much of a cliffhanger, but I guess that just makes me more motivated to pick up the second one in the series.  Overall, I'd recommend this book to my friends looking for a fun, easy read. It's not terribly difficult to get through and the story and characters keep you interested to keep going. The writing is also nice because it's not as elementary as "Twilight" but equal/a little more elevated than "Harry Potter." For me, the most interesting part of this book was the romance arch with Katniss, Peeta and Gale. But there's also action, suspense and emotion, so I can see it being accessible to all types of readers. Have fun with it!
So... I had a push-and-pull relationship with this book. I had heard so much about this book that I just had to get it. But i have huge collection of unread books and this wasn't at the top. However after several months i finally convinced myself to pick it up. 5 days ago, in the morning, I did, i've read barely half page and something came up, so i had to put it down. Then later, i started again from the beginning, i've read 2 pages and someone interrupted me...again. I was like, "GOD! The big daddy up there doesn't want me to read this bloody book..." . 2 days ago i picked up again, logged out from everywhere, turned on my instrumental music (ya, usually i listen instrumental musics -Two Steps from Hell, Immadiate Music, Brand X Music - while i read books.) and started to read from the 2nd page. In about 8 hours i finished and was stunned. I can say, that i'm addicted to the story, the charaters, the world of Hunger Games.  There are No POV changes in this book. All first person present from Katniss. Which was a little bit weird for me, because i think (if my memory works fine this time...) this was the first story told by first person present i've ever read. But i quickly got used to it.  What I liked:  I absolutely loved the story of this "World".  How the Hunger Games work. Every little detail, rules, featured events.  The characters. Even the minor characters has something in them what makes you can not forget them.  There isn't an easy solution for every problem. They have to fight for it. They have to suffer for even a minute rest.  Lots of ACTION!! Yes i'm an adrenaline junkie, so bring it on baby!!  What i didn't like:  There was one thing, i didn't like. Katniss talking about the same thing over and over. And after several times i got tired of it, that i had to read about it AGAIN.  OVERALL: I'm so so so happy that i've read this book. This is one book worth reading. I was afraid that the slowness at the beginning will be annoying and exhausting, but no. I really liked the story, so it turned out well. You know my favourite genre is in between the Urban Fantasy and the Paranormal romance, and i think this was the second (i have no idea what was the 1st...) Dystopia book i've read. And i just falling in love with this genre. I'm looking very much forward to read Catching Fire.
This was a gripping book. While it is referred to as "teen fiction" I think one can use the term "teen" loosely; while it might be geared toward a younger age bracket, adults will certainly enjoy it as well. It's well-written with an excellent plot, and the themes are certainly very adult (e.g. rebelling against big brother, human rights, the role of violence). I read the entire series in two days; you absolutely cannot put them down.  That said, it's obviously not a universally appealing book. The same themes that make the novel thought-provoking are upsetting, and the action that makes you unable to put them down will not appeal to all. Collins kills characters, which isn't easy. But she does so for the advancement of the plot and to make the grim dystopia more threatening and tangible. The violence is neither gratuitous nor over the top, given the premise of the series. I generally don't like violent stories, but found these very compelling. They'll leave you emotionally drained and hungering for more. I would recommend parental judgement be used if younger teens want to read these.  A brief introduction: This is set in a future, dystopian North America in the nation of Panem. There are twelve districts ruled by the Capitol. At some point in the past, they and a thirteenth district rebelled. The Capitol triumphed and destroyed the thirteenth district. As punishment and a reminder of their subservience, each of the twelve must send one boy and one girl (ages 12-18) as tribute to the Capitol each year to participate in the "Hunger Games." The tributes are placed in an arena made to look like some ecosystem (it could be a desert, jungle, tundra, anything) and have fight to the death. These games are televised and serve as "entertainment." The victor is sent home wealthy. The districts range in affluence. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is from the very poor District 12 that mines coal. This places District 12 tributes at a disadvantage, as they possess no fighting skills and are often malnourished.  Katniss is a feisty, likeable heroine. She and the other characters are well-developed. Collins is an excellent writer who successfully combines action with character development and dry humor. I highly recommend these books; you won't be able to put them down!  Katniss is a resourceful sixteen-year-old who often breaks the law to sneak under a fence and hunt in the woods, which is forbidden. She must do this to survive, as her father was killed years ago in a mining accident. This caused her mother to become depressed, and the burden of providing for her mother and sister, Prim, fell to Katniss. She became a successful hunter and gatherer, skilled with a bow. She loves Prim more than anything. When tributes are chosen, Prim is nervous. Katniss comforts her, telling her that since she is only 12, her name is only in the lottery once, and she is unlikely to be chosen. Unfortunately, she is. At this, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  She is then flung into a world in which she must dress and act a certain way to gain support and sponsors, who may pay to ease her way in the Games. Advised only by a former victor from her district, the perpetually drunk Haymitch Abernathy, she must learn quickly. Along the way, she gets to know her fellow tribute, Peeta Mellark. She becomes close to her stylist, Cinna, who is a source of support and wisdom for her.  As she and Peeta spin tales of love to gain sympathy, Katniss must decide whose feelings are real and fake. And in the arena, she must fight to survive. The choices she makes change her, and ultimately affect all of Panem.
Suzanne Collins has done a great job with The Hunger Games. I just got a new Kindle Fire and this was the first book I read on it.  It's a good book, so good I read it in two days. For someone who normally takes weeks to finnish books, that's saying something. The beginning of the book is a little slow, but as you begin to see the main character's past and learn about their world you begin to become so intrigued, you want to keep reading. I do wish that Collins would have elaborated more on the "post-apocolyptic" world that she created. I would have enjoyed more detail so that i would be able to understand what to imagine, because at times it seems like these people are living in severe poverty caused by the apocalypse, but at other times it seems like the technology is still very advanced. Even though this is kind-of explained by the fact that there are different districts, there still isn't much explanation why, and it leaves you wanting.  The only real problem I encountered in reading the book was that up until the middle/last third of the book you are lead to believe that the climax and most of the action that will draw you in will be physical, action packed, and that Katniss will have to use her bow skills to defeat enemies and whatnot, actually turns out to be more emotional and instead of focusing on the fighting between competitors, all of a sudden this becomes one huge love story and you barely read a page without Katniss kissing Peeta, and reading hints of some sort of emotional struggle that she is now going through. I'm sorry, but if I wanted to read Twilight, I would have.  While that was annoying and I finished the book wishing that it would have had a better finnish, it wasn't totally bad. While at times corny and reminding me of a high school teenage girl, I did enjoy the book and will probably read the second. I guess you could say that I was hoping that it would be a more neutral book, not focusing too much on physical fighting and action (what some would see as viscously male) and not focusing too much on love and an inner fight of emotional proportion (what is seen as feminine). That's why the book gets a 4/5.
I am still pretty new to the Dystopian genre in YA Literature.  This has been by choice.  But now after reading a few Dystopian novels I am asking myself "Why did I wait? What was I afraid of?" If all Dystopian books are written like this then my fears will vanish!  As many other fellow reviewers have stated, The Hunger Games is very very addictive.  I cannot quite put my finger on why, but you immediately become invested in the book, the plot and the characters.  You automatically feel a connection to each character, even beyond Katniss, through Katniss' own emotions for them.  Katniss lives within the poorest and dirtiest of all 12 Districts.  She is forced to hunt outside of District 12 and takes constant risks to make sure that her mother and sister do not starve to death (something that is quite common in District 12).  Her ally in this is Gale.  At first I thought Gale and Katniss made the perfect couple, understanding each other so clearly.  That is until she meets Peeta after volunteering to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games.  The relationship between Katniss and Peeta has you constantly guessing - not only about Katniss' feelings for Peeta and Peeta's for Katniss but also Peeta's intentions and role in the Game.  Its through the Game that Katniss' real strengths really shine.  And of course we cannot forget Peeta's feelings and role.  Again, I cannot quite put my finger on why this book was so addictive.  I found the character development quite wonderful and Suzanne Collins' plot lines unique and interesting.  Once you step back from this book you find that there are many layers to not only the plot but to the characters as well.  In terms of quickness, this is easily a novel you could have read and an audiobook to listen to in one day.  I am definitely looking forward to picking up the sequel!
Everyone on here writing One Star reviews for The Hunger Games don't seem to be very open minded. You may not like some of the things Collins did with the story; doesn't mean anything was wrong with it. Some of the reviews on here talk about how it's a shame that it was from Katniss' view, and not just generally narrated; the fact that you didn't get to know more about the other characters and what they were feeling and going through. THAT'S THE POINT! Have you ever been in certain situations and not know what other people are feeling or thinking at all times? Happened to me!!! hard to believe...I know!! ......... come on people!!!!  So aside from the one star reviews, yes, this is a magnificent story! I mean, again, the story is told from the perspective of a 16 year old girl and I think the author does a fantastic job of capturing her adolescent behavior/emotions. Some of the reviews dissed the author's "word usage", saying it was "too simple of a read"..again, how sophisticated would you expect a 16 year old from a broken down nation to be? I think the dialogue of the novel throughout is spot on. It doesn't take away from the story at all...it adds much more endearment and charm to the characters with just how smart they actually are. You don't need dialogue of Shakespeare to develop a complex story line! And the fact that there's not necessarily a full-out happy ending that everyone knows and loves is just asking for too much. After going through something as traumatic as killing other human beings for entertainment, you're never going to be the same...EVER AGAIN! You have to know this is fiction, and for the most part, fantasy. A lot of people can't seem to place themselves in said situation and understand the psychological repercussions of your actions!  SOO...I kind of just wanted to post this for all to see and understand the close-mindedness of the One Star reviews. This is really a great story for all ages. Everyone says it's directed towards young adults, but so was Harry Potter and look how well that did amongst people of all ages! ;) Again, just doing a bashing of my own on the One Star-ers. There's a reason you'll come across 2800 5 star reviews...it's well worth it. Oh, and I don't know if it's just the Kindle version I got from my friend, but I found quite a few spelling and grammatical errors in the first book, so I'd recommend purchasing the physical book. If that doesn't bother you a whole lot, then the Kindle version is just fine. Hope this was helpful!! And this is my first review on anything on Amazon. Just felt compelled to defend this series!!! GET ALL 3 BOOKS!! :D  Aaron
I will admit that this book, for the longest time, I did not want to read. Why? Because my wife read it right around the same time she read all the twilight novels and its a "teen" book so I grouped this book into the same category. Wow, was I wrong. Dead wrong...  This book took me about 60 pages to really get into but after that it was a, I have to stay up to finish this book, type of book. The gist of the story is the USA is no more. A Capital has taken over the country and divided up the US into 12 districts each providing a unique product to the capitol. Every year to remind the districts that the Capitol is in control they choose a boy and a girl from each district and pit them against each other in a battle royale titled The Hunger Games. There can only be one victor and he or she is then given money, a home and are removed from ever entering the games again.  Katniss, the protagonist of this book is chosen in the games and is pitted against a fellow district boy who saved her life when she was younger and starving to death. Throughout the games allies are formed, betrayals are had and the end is something the Capitol doesn't want. Hope. Hope for the overthrow of a nation.  The story started off a bit slow but once she is chosen for the games zips right along and continues at a break neck pace till the last sentence of the book. There is quite a bit of violence in this book, which is to be expected in a battle royale situation but I found the violence to be less then I expected. About 4 years ago I read "Battle Royale" by Koushun Takami which is in a way a similar book. That book was very, very violent. So, I was expecting something similar to that. But being a Teen book there isn't any way it could be.  The only down fall about this book, and this is coming from a males perspective, is the whole love triangle thing. Of course this book had to have one to appease the teenyboppers but I wish they could have not put so much into it. But at the same time it plays into the next book more than I had realized upon reading this first installment.  With the third and final act of the hunger games coming out next week, I am very eager to see how she wraps things up.  If you want a book about a big brother, to the death type book. Read this book. You will not be disappointed.
Oh my. Where to begin? This gem of a book has been forever the top of the list on Amazon.com. I never payed much attention (if any) to it. Unfortunately, whenever I read what at the time I considered the best book ever, I feel as if I'm never going to find a book quite like it. That's what happened before this book. But, boy, was I wrong! I am not exaggerating, I LITERALLY did not put this down until 4:45 AM, because my Kindle's battery died on me (oh the HORROR).  I loved the concept of it, despite how disturbing it was, and at the beginning, I couldn't help but wondering, "Wow, what was Suzanne thinking when she came up with such a plot?!" The characters are unforgettable, each with little specs that make you love/hate them in their own special way. The narrator's in depth point of view provides valuable insight to what was going on through her head at the time. Collins' writing is simple, yet captivating, in a way that makes you desire to read more. It hurt a lot when this book ended, but it's partly my fault because I read it in nine hours.  Of course, there is a good amount of violence, so I'd reccomend this to 12+ audience at the very least. While the concept is pretty brutal, it is all the most engaging. This book is action packed, and I absolutely cannot wait for the movie!  In the many reviews that I had read before reading this book, I unfortunately came across a great deal of spoilers that particularly flawed the reading experience. I know how some of you feel about spoilers, so I won't bother to say anything about the plot or what happens in the end (although it is a bit predictable)!  It's been a while since I've felt this way about a book. While I'm quite sure there are many other books similar to its life or death plot, for some reason, this is unique. While I read the other two books, I will be eagerly and painfully awaiting the release of the Hunger Games movie. If you choose to read this, enjoy!  - A satisfied reader!
The timing of Ms. Collin's trilogy couldn't be better with the Occupy movement inflaming long suppressed feelings in the US about class distinctions and inequality.  As a work of social and political fiction, it has ignited my interest more than anything I have read in recent years. And Ms.Collins manages the political content without ever appearing to get on a soap box.  I am currently on the third book, "Mockingjay" which starts a little slow compared to the first two.  Ms. Collin's heroin, Katniss, is one of the most interesting woman characters I have encountered, rivaling Ayla in Jean Auel's "Cave Bear" series.  She is a reluctant participant in events much bigger than her personal world.  She also displays the 'woods smart' savvy and focus forced on her by her circumstances (e.g. feeding her family) while retaining some of the emotional issues of a teenage girl.  Ms. Collins also does a fine job balancing the front stories of the political and social events with the back stories of Katniss's family and friends.  I predict that when the movie comes out next year, it will get a lot of media attention due to its political implications.  When I wrote the preceeding part of this review, I was about 1/3 way through the third book. The third book starts out slowly and Katniss seems to have become a little flakey as a character.  I wondered if Ms. Collins had run out of plot and ideas.  Then things pick up and Mockingjay adds the most complex themes of all three novels.  For example that sometimes it is difficult to know if you are doing right or wrong or to know for sure what the truth is. Not wanting to leave spoilers, I will just say that the ending was satisfying to me and all the major plot threads are resolved. The point is graphically made that the only real legacy that violence leaves is more violence.
How many of us spend any time imagining what our country or our world may be like in 100, 1000, 10,000 years?  Hunger Games is one of the few books that both myself and my kids found fascinating. It was recommended summer reading for our 14 yr. old and, to my surprise, he almost literally devoured it in less than one day and immediately asked for 'part two' which he got instantly (Kindle magic). Out of curiosity I tried it myself and... guess what, I finished it in maybe 2 days, then continued with 'part two', then 'part three'.  Initial plot classification - think of Stephen King's 'The Running Man' with a lot more context. America as we know it is gone and, centuries later all that's left is Panem, consisting of 'the Capitol', Evil Empire's rotten core, and the 12 impoverished 'districts' whose attempt at secession was defeated by the Capitol some 75 years ago. The districts are now reduced to specialized suppliers tasked with meeting Capitol's needs, constantly reminded of their past defeat, occupied and ruled by a force of ruthless 'peace keepers', the inhabitants arrested, tortured and executed for such capital offenses as bearing anything resembling a 'weapon' or crossing the district's electrified fenced border without authorization. Each district must provide 2 young teens, a boy and a girl to compete in the annual Hunger Games from each only one out of the 24 contestants emerges alive. The Hunger Games is one way the Capitol reminds the defeated districts who won the last war and who is still in control.  Hunger Games is the story of Katniss, a 16 year old girl from 'District 12', the poorest of all districts, who volunteers into the games so that her 12 year old beloved sister may live. There's a lot more to the story but this is a book that's better read than read about in a review.  Ms. Collins takes no prisoners. She wrote a story that's both depressingly and uncompromisingly dark and, surprisingly, daringly insightful into the meaning and the ultimate worth of human life, freedom, love, compassion, self sacrifice as they manifest themselves and transform themselves under extreme conditions. The Hunger Games are a captivating spectacle no one in Panem is allowed to miss. Suzanne Collins' chronicle of the 73rd edition of the games is a story we must all read because it depicts one possible future.
In the last several years I haven't been moved a single time to write a review for any of the (probably hundreds) of books that I've read.  I'm moved today.  About four days ago I started in on The Hunger Games, a book which I'd heard a lot about, but hadn't yet had the gumption to delve into. I started slow, downloading the first installment to my Kindle thinking that if I didn't like it, I would only be out 5 bucks.  Four days later I'm finished the entire trilogy.  I literally could not put it down and found myself 'sneaking' peeks at the LCD-lit pages of my iPhone Kindle app while I was at work. The story is enthralling and the portraits of the characters are just as enthralling. Collins describes in the first pages the relationship between Katniss and her sister Prim's cat, Buttercup. In this small and simple description we learn exactly who Katniss is going to be, and we spend the next three books sucked into a world of action, romance, and ambivalent moments of will-she, won't-she that kept me absolutely riveted to the pages.  Throughout the entire ordeal I kept finding myself on pins and needles trying to figure out what was going to happen. In this day in age it's rare to find something so unpredictable and delightfully frustrating in a YA book. There were times during the story that I actually heard myself talking to the pages with a sudden gasp or an "Oh, no..." or a "That's heartbreaking..." It didn't take me long to realize that I was emotionally invested in every character that was thrown at me. I tried to puzzle out which male protagonist would be the one to finally win Katniss over, but the two men of the story were so evenly painted that I could find no obvious favoritism toward one or the other.  There is death and violence, but there is the always-indelible Peeta there to lighten the mood and make us a little sentimentally squishy in the aftermath.  A perfect balance of light and dark.  I mowed through this entire series in four days and when I was done I wanted to pick up The Hunger Games and start all over again. The story lingered with me long after I put it down, and I'm suddenly thrown into that silly pool of fangirls that will, inevitably, be standing in line for the soon-to-be silver screen adaptation of the series.  I sincerely hope they can do it justice.  May the odds be ever in their favor...  A.
When I first saw an excerpt of this book on Stephenie Meyer's website I figured if she liked it, and I like her books, then I should like it too. Well, after the first handfull of pages I wasn't into the story so I wrote it off. A couple of months back I heard that they were making the Hunger Games into a movie. I was at the local bookstore, picked up the book and read the inside cover. I thought to myself that this book sounded very interesting and why in the heck didn't I finish reading the excerpt on the website. Anyway, I did something that I never, ever do anymore....I bought all 3 without reading a single one. I have bought the first and second book in a series and I usually have to force myself to get though the first book and never pick up the second. I read them back to back and enjoyed each one to the point where I want to read them again. My son, who is 17, commented that some of his friends where talking about the book and if he could borrow the Hunger Games. I told him that it starts slow, but you will know when the story begins to pick up. He loved the book! Now, he is not a reader like me and won't read them back to back. I'm waiting for school to start again and maybe, just maybe he will have the second book read by the time the first movie comes out. I don't like to critique books because everyone has a reading style, or an author they prefer. And I never use reviews as a basis to buy or not to buy a book. I like to tell people the story of how I came across the book because there is always someone out there with a story similar to yours. This book, for you, might have been 'my daughter left it lying on the kitchen counter and I grabbed it on my way to the doctor's office because, as you know, the magazines stink'. Everyone has their own story...what is yours?
I purchased this book because of all the hype I'd been hearing about it, and I must say, it did not disappoint. I finished the whole trilogy over the course of 3 days because it is, without a doubt, an edge-of-your seat thriller.  Many people have voiced concerns about the brutality of the book, it is gory, it is graphic, and it is slightly disturbing. That's the point. The author is making a show of what war-torn and violent countries are like for children. People rage on about the violence in "The Hunger Games" and how it disturbed them, apparently forgetting that there are parts of the world where children (younger then 12, mind you) are actually given weapons and told to kill or be killed. Yes, this book will stick with you. Yes, I have had continued strange and disturbing dreams because of it, but that does not negate its merit as a good or worthwhile book and I'm still glad I read it.  The setting is not far removed from many dystopian futures, and I cannot speak to the similarities mentioned between this series and some international books, but this one is a good read, it's exciting, the characters are interesting, the setting isn't too far from home and you will not be able to put it down until you get to the end.  No, some of the characters are not particularly likeable, the protagonist included. I, personally, tend to like having a main character who has motives and actions that I question, it makes it interesting. You don't have to love Katniss all the time, and you probably won't, but that doesn't make her unworthy or her story less thrilling, and even when you don't like her, there are many other much more likeable characters to cling to.  I wouldn't recommend this for younger children. It is a bit brutal in places, but for older kids, upper middle school/high school, I think it would be great. I'm a graduate student with a soft spot for young adult fiction, and I really enjoyed it, if "enjoy" is the appropriate word for things like this.  Basically, this is a quick read, but one that will stay with you for a long time, be prepared to be shocked, disturbed and occasionally disappointed. You will not regret reading it, but you certainly won't forget it.
This review contains very minor spoilers  The Hunger Games is a good book. For the most part, it's fast-paced and the characters are likable enough. The plot is also very interesting. The book really held my attention until the very end. But I will get to that.  First of all, the premise of the book is pretty dark. The US is now Panem, divided into 12 districts plus the ruling Capitol, and every year a raffle called the reaping takes place in all 12 districts, where two children aged 12-18 are selected to compete in The Hunger Games, a 24-person battle to the death, where only one can walk out alive. And the entire thing is televised and required viewing in all districts, as a reminder to the population that the Capitol has complete control over their lives.  The story is told from the perspective of Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year-old girl whose sister's name is drawn from the reaping ball, and through a rule in the games, is allowed to volunteer to take her place. Her life is a tragic story, as are most protagonists; father killed when she was 11 or so and her mother slips into depression, leaving her to step up and assume the responsibilities of feeding her family. Her absent mother and dead father force Katniss to grow up too quickly, and she turns out rather emotionally shut off.  All of this is fine, up to a point. But the first thing that started to break my immersion with the book was that from the beginning Katniss is painted as a pretty cold and calculating person. Even after volunteering to take her sister's place and thinking she was never going to make it back alive, she sheds no tears. But at a certain points throughout the second half and especially towards the end, Katniss is portrayed as being just like any other 16 year-old girl. Being irrational and overly emotional, when from the beginning she is supposed to be some distant and aloof loner, with only one real friend. There is no inherent problem in any of this. Maybe being forced to kill another human breaks something inside of her, and she has to confront these strange new emotions...  But the problem is, that idea is never explored. When I was reading some of the critic's reviews of this book, one that piqued my interest said that the author explored the effect of war on children. Except there is no real exploration. We are told what happens, and given Katniss's reaction to it, without giving us the reasoning why she is reacting this way. Writing too much can be just as harmful to a book as not writing enough. There should be a happy medium though. It breaks my personal suspension of disbelief when I am presented with two conflicting ideas that the author is trying to create. Firstly, that Katniss is supposed to be logical and detached from the moment, and secondly that there are some emotional situations she just can't see to deal with without throwing an irrational and uncontrolled temper tantrum.  Again, neither of these two ideas are conflicting necessarily, until you see the context they are presented in. She has no qualms about putting an arrow through the neck of a fellow combatant, but she freaks out when she has to contemplate which of the two heart-throbs she will choose. And that is the major flaw  in the book that I found. That towards the end especially, the book becomes about some stupid love triangle, and all I could think about was the Twilight saga and all the teenage drama. Emotional betrayal and the like. It is way too juvenile considering the darkness of the premise of the story. It's fine to have a romance sub-plot, it's even fine to write a book where The Hunger Games are secondary to the drama of the love triangle. But the major flaw in The Hunger Games is that for the first seven-eighths of the book the focus is almost entirely on the games themselves. And then suddenly the focus shifts to this completely unnecessary drama involving two great guys and this very flawed girl. You can't do that and maintain a theme. I felt the end of the book was all wrong in terms focus.  However, I am not trying to turn anyone away from reading The Hunger Games. It's a good book. But I think you will probably get more out of it if you are in your teens (and I'm not being demeaning when I say that). The problem for me is that I have read a fair amount of books aimed at teenagers that pull off their premises without coming across as being completely out of place.
YA post-apocalyptic world where kids are forced to fight each other to the death in amped up Gladiator-like games with better technology.  Need I say more?  Oh wait, there's also great writing, well-paced suspense, and endearing characters who show room for growth and development.  Collins takes us to some point in the dark future or alternate reality where North America is instead known as Panem with a Capitol and 13 districts.  The districts eventually rebelled until the Capitol squashed them and completely destroyed District 13.  After the rebellion the Capitol established the Hunger Games, a sick and twisted annual "game" where each of the remaining 12 districts hold "reapings" to randomly select 1 boy and 1 girl (the "tributes") to fight to the death, televised in a huge outdoor arena, until 1 tribute remains.  The Capitol cruelly forces everyone to celebrate the Games as a festivity to add further humiliation and to remind all of the districts how they are totally at the mercy of the Capitol.  Hunger Games follows the main character Katniss Evergreen (ugh to name), a 16 year-old girl who lives in District 12, who is pushed into the world of the Hunger Games.  Like any good heroine, Katniss is smart and resourceful with absentish parents and several potential love interests.  While Katniss' world is bleak and grim, she's managed to carve out an interesting and manageable life that readers can take pleasure in reading and imagining, all while remaining in the safety and comfort of lush in comparison homes.  Collins has created a survivor character we can live vicariously through and root for, while keeping her from being a total emotional zombie by adding Prim and Gale (and later, other characters tied to the Hunger Games) to the mix.  When you pick up Hunger Games, be sure to do it when you have free time over the next few days because as soon as you finish it you will be on to the next one, and then the one after that, and then you'll be sad that the series is over but glad to not have to wait on a cliffhanger for a year as you wait for the next book (Bah - I'm looking at you Alchemyst series!).
I'm in 7th grade and never intended on reading this book until my best friend who is the biggest Jabberjay I'd ever met (in case you didn't know, Jabberjay is what extreme Hunger Games fans are called) made me. If you've never met a 13 year old girl, you should know that they can be VERY persuasive. But as soon as I read the first chapter, I was completely hooked! I think the whole thing is amazing and I loved the whole romance between Katniss and Peeta, who are honestly the best characters in this entire series. I was so intrigued in reading this book, I became obsessed with reading it! I read all 3 books in 2 days! It was definately a spine-tingling, exhillerating book that keeps you wanting more.    The story is based in a country called Panem in the future after North American fails. The country consists of 12 Districts and a Capitol. In the past, the Districts attempted to overthrow the Capitol, but lost. As a concequence of losing the war against the Capitol, each year a boy and a girl from each District from the age 12 to 17 would be choosen from a ballot to compete in the national "Hunger Games." In the Hunger Games, the 24 children are forsed to fight to the death until only one remains, becoming the Victor. When 16 year old Katniss Everdeen's 12 year old sister, Prim, is chosen from the ballot, she volenteers in fear for her sister so she can prevent her from dying. Peeta Mellark, the bakers son, is the boy Tribute from District 12, and will go in the Games with Katniss.    After the "74th Annual Hunger Games" begin, the judge announces that the Tributes from the same Districts are allowed to work with one another, if still alive. Katniss and Peeta, who have formed a romance, work together until (spoiler!!!) they are the only 2 left. But instead of them winning as a team, the judge announces that the rules have been changed back and there can only be 1 Victor. But the 2 District 12 Tributes have decided that they cannot live without one another and don't want to be treated like "a piece in the Capitol's games". Will Katniss win and Peeta die? Will Peeta win and Katniss die? Or will they both eat the poisionous berries called "Nightlock" that they found so that they can be together forever? Read Suzanne Collins's "The Hunger Games" to find out, and... "May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor!"
The first time I read this, I gave it a 5 star review. However, when I went back to reread it objectively, my opinion of it dropped significantly.  Also, I'd like to get it out of the way right now: the writing really bothered me in that it was in present tense. In my opinion, that makes it harder to really get into the story because it's supposed to be happening right now. I suppose someone who is easily absorbed into a story wouldn't have as much of a problem with this.  I do think that there are a lot of good things about this book. I don't think it will become a classic, and you'll ever be able to use it on the AP English Lit exam. But, it's still good for entertainment's sake. The symbolism is certainly not subtle, and the book introduces no ground-breaking or revolutionary ideas.  The characterization is very good. I felt like Katniss could be a real person at some point in time. Although, I'll admit I wanted to slap her and tell her to just settle down with Peeta, for god's sake.  I also think the premise is very good. I hear a lot of people saying it has a major plot hole. They say that no parent would ever let their child be taken. That things would never be this bad. Is it really that unrealistic, though? Think of the things we tolerate from our own governments in this modern, "enlightened" day and age. Privacy violations, profiling, constant monitoring, snoopy officials, people in prison for things they never did. People being tortured simply because they were the wrong religion and in a certain country at a certain time. We put up with all of this, we simply turn the other cheek and claim it's for the good of the country. For "national security." Isn't that the excuse given for The Hunger Games? They're for national security.
Sometimes I can be really slow getting around to reading things in my TBR stack and I have been slow getting to this novel. I have had several people mention it to me over time, but just recently a good friend told me I really NEEDED to read this. She was incredibly animated in her enthusiasm so I decided to bite the bullet and read it. I typically don't enjoy YA fiction, with the exception of Harry Potter which I think is wonderful (and stood in line at midnight on more than one occasion to purchase the latest installment).  "The Hunger Games" is set in what used to be the United States of America. The country as we know it has collapsed and a new country named Panem has replaced it. The new government has total control of its citizens who live in twelve districts and the Capitol (located in the Rocky Mountains). Every year, the Capitol oversees the Hunger Games when 24 young people, one boy and one girl from each district, fight until only one of them is left alive. Katniss is our main character and is a 16-year-old girl competing for her district in what was formerly Appalachia. The boy competing from her district is Peeta, the baker's son who she has encountered before but really doesn't know and appears to be very unprepared for the task at hand. The novel begins on the day the two teenagers are selected and follows all the preparations leading up to the Games, the Games themselves, and what happens to the survivor after everything is over.  As a story, I found myself reading very quickly to find out what was going to happen and read it in just a couple of days. It is well-written and while not terribly complex, it definitely doesn't "talk down" to the younger audience it has been written for. I also appreciated how much better it is than much of the YA literature that is available with their major themes of popularity, overt sex, and superficial fluff. While there is the requisite love interest(s) it is just one theme of many, not the center of the book --- much appreciated by this particular mother. The basis of the story is disturbing (children killing children) so a parent would need to be very aware of the level of maturity of the young person reading it to know if the subject matter is appropriate.  Bottom line - enjoyed it enough to continue on with the second book in the series and to recommend it (with qualifications) to other parents of young adults.
Over a century from now, North America is a land ravaged by floods and war. Out of the ashes a new nation, Panem, has emerged, consisting of the glorious city known as the Capitol and twelve outlying districts which only exist to provide the Capitol with resources (a thirteenth district was destroyed in a rebellion three-quarters of a century ago). To keep the people in line, the government enforces the Hunger Games, a reality TV show where twenty-four teenage boys and girls must fight one another for survival in a game of wits and strength.  Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take the place of her sister when she is selected for the Games. Transported to a hostile wilderness, Katniss must use every bit of her cunning and her training as a hunter to prevail.  The Hunger Games is the first book in the trilogy of the same name. First published in 2008, it has become a hugely successful novel, spawning two sequels and a forthcoming movie adaptation, and has won plaudits from both younger readers and adults alike (Stephen King is a noted fan).  The premise is unoriginal but Collins nevertheless executes it reasonably well. This is a brisk read where Collins develops the plot and delivers action beats with skill, but not at the expense of characterisation (though, with only two characters of note to develop, this isn't as challenging as it could be). Katniss is an intriguing but more interesting is the way that Collins establishes the motivation and character of Peeta, Katniss's sometimes-ally in the games, since we only see him through Katniss's eyes. Characters outside these two are less well-developed, however.  Collins also holds back on exploring the full savagery of the games, perhaps understandably given the target audience. Still, there is the feeling that we more hear about how horrible the games are rather than seeing them in full flow (one tense moment involving mutated dogs aside). In addition, we know very little about the other contestants. A couple get some nice moments in the sun so we feel bad when they die, but generally the focus of the game itself is the mental battle of wills and PR that Katniss and Peeta are playing with the people running the game. This is surprising and considerably more difficult than just showing the contestants offing one another, since this struggle can only by necessity be depicted through one side, since we only have Katniss's POV, so we, like her, can only guess what the people in the Capitol are up to. To Collins' credit she pulls it off, and works in a couple of interesting themes about reality TV, bloodsports, PR and marketing into the bargain.  The book does have a potential problem in that it does come off very much like a Battle Royale-lite. Whilst that's not a problem if you've never read or seen Battle Royale, if you have then the weaknesses of The Hunger Games become slightly more apparent. Most notably, whilst Collins' Games are cruel, they don't match the shocking harshness that Royale achieves by simply having all the contestants be in the same school year, meaning they've known one another for years before having to kill one another. In that sense, Koushan Takami scores higher with some of the things he wants to say about youth and teenager-hood being a Darwinian struggle for survival. At the same time, the two works, whilst stemming from the same basic idea, are aimed in rather different directions and Takami benefits from a much greater word-count and a more adult audience to work with, so comparisons between the two are fair only up to a point.  Moving on from that, The Hunger Games (****) is a fast-paced, enjoyable read with some interesting (if hardly revelatory) things to say about celebrity and PR, not to mention a counter-intuitive approach to the inevitable romance story, but suffers a little from the well-mined premise and patchy characterisation. The novel is available now in the UK and USA.
Back cover:  "Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun...  In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the district in line by forcing them to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.  Sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before--and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love."  More info:  The story is told in first-person through the eyes of sixteen-year-old Katniss, and is well-written. It starts out somewhat slow at first but quickly gets to the point of the story--by the end of the first chapter the contestants for the Hunger Games have been chosen. After this the pacing picks up, and the author doesn't waste time adding in pointless filler, staying right on track with the story. There is plenty of action and suspense but very little romance. PARENTS: This is definitely a book for older teens since the plot centers around 12-18yr olds having to fight to the death on live TV. It's not gory, but it can be disturbing/frightening.  Recommendations:  This was a very intriguing read, but at the same time very chilling and disturbing. There was enough suspense to keep me turning the pages until the end, and there were a few very intense moments that had me on the edge of my seat. Now for the reason I gave it four stars...  *SPOILERS*  To me, surviving the games seemed almost a little to easy for Katniss. We see her hunting and looking for water and sleeping in trees more than fighting for survival against the other competitors. I wondered how the author would pull off her character being put in a position where she has to kill others and still keep her likable. Well, the first time Katniss kills in indirect--she drops a nest of poisonous insects on her enemies while trapped in a tree. The second time it is justified--a competitor has just killed the young girl she allied with so she kills him in revenge. And the third time it is merciful--when the climax comes down to the final competitor he conveniently falls to a pack of mutant dogs and after a night of being slowly torn to pieces Katniss shoots him to put him out of his misery. The way these deaths came about just seemed a little too convenient for the character. It's not that I wanted her to kill anyone, it's just that that was a huge issue in the story and it seems that she didn't really have to deal with that.  *END SPOILERS*  I recommend The Hunger Games but it definitely isn't for everyone. I really enjoyed it but I think I preferred the dystopian world of Lauren Olvier's Delirium.
It's taken me a long while to think about what to say about The Hunger Games trilogy. I really liked the books and they've earned a permanent place in my collection, but I wouldn't necessarily say they were enjoyable. There are many aspects that bring happiness to Katniss's life. But overall, the world Collins creates is very bleak, sometimes shocking with how oppressed the people are and what they are willing to let happen to them.  Collins's characters for the most part are full of depth and reality. I found myself very attached to Rue. It's not often that a book can move me to tears, but I was genuinely upset with what happens to her. So much so that even mentioning her later in the series had me tearing up then. While I related more to Katniss's personality, I couldn't love her as much as I did Rue. On the opposite end of the scale, I found Katniss's mother to be very shallow and two-dimensional, as if she was there only to serve the plot and not be a living, breathing character affected by all the change around her.  As much as I loathed the fate of some characters, it was refreshing not to see Collins hampered by death in a teen book. The lesson that human brutality may occur without any violence or lifting a finger was portrayed well, in addition to those scenes where violence was present. The world Collins creates is so detailed and rich I often found my dreams trapping me in Katniss's bleak world. There were times that I would take a break and have to remind myself that it was okay to go outside because the world in which I live is not as oppressive as hers.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone over 13. While I don't discourage anyone under 13 from reading it, I don't think the maturity level for anyone much younger is at a place to truly appreciate Katniss's struggle. Although, the violence may be disturbing for younger readers as well.
"The Hunger Games" is one of those concept pieces that was intriguing enough to pick up, even if I am an adult reading a "young adult" book.  Who doesn't like a good post-apocalyptic scenario?  America has been destroyed by environmental changes and war; a totalitarian regime has been established in its place.  At some point in the history of Panem, a rebellion occurred and was squashed.  Ever since, the twelve poverty-stricken districts that make up Panem must send two of their teenagers to a Roman Gladiator style battle to the death...just to make sure everyone knows who is really in charge.  Just the anticipation of how this would play out had me turning the pages just as fast I could tap the forward button on my Kindle.  I read several reviews before finally picking this up.  Many lower star reviews point to the extreme violence presented by the author.  I was expecting a gore-fest something akin to "Kill Bill" by their descriptions.  Nothing could be further from accurate.  The author handled this brutal game as finely as possible.  There were never any over-the-top descriptions of death.  Even those kills made by the main characters are done so in a light that doesn't make them murderers.  The author clearly sets up a set of antagonists to contrast the innocent nature of the main characters forced to kill or be killed.  Those who thought it too violent are probably too sensitive to read/watch war scenarios anyway.  I take away one star because I was actually longing for a bit more detail, particularly into the psyche that comes at the point of making a kill.  It seemed almost too fast-paced, oddly, like "oh! we're already done with that subplot...moving on."  To the point where I felt like in such awful circumstances, the main characters got off too easy.  A war is brewing and how it affects young people in all of their vulnerability is what the author focuses on.  What does battle force the innocent to become?  How can those pure of heart hang on to their innocence and love?  Those are the themes that come out of this book.  Looking forward to the next two!
I can't review this without spoilers (because here at Kathryn's Book Nook, we believe in honesty and sharing our try feelings - no I don't have multiple personality disorder). Anyway, a short preview before I spoiler (don't worry, there will be a warning).  To start off with, I felt intense apprehension about reading this book. Everyone I talked to who read it said that they loved it. People who didn't love Young Adult or Science Fiction loved this book. Now, I don't really know why this worried me - if anything it should have reassured me that I would love this book - but I just couldn't force myself to read it. I would pick it up in the book store to go to read it and I couldn't. It isn't that I am one of those people who can't read popular books, when I found out that Twilight was popular, I read it. The problem was that I just didn't think I could like this particular book. So two days ago, I picked up the book and started reading it (like a chore). I couldn't get into it... the first 12 pages were so boring. I had gotten that far before and then abandoned it. But I pushed through this time, and I am glad I did. All I can say is that if you haven't read this book, read it.  SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  /~/  /~/  /~/  /~/  /~/  /~/  /~/  /~/  /~/  Okay, now lets get down to the nitty gritty feelings left because of the book... The first thing I want to address is Rue. I was devastated by her death. I cried (just a little bit) and I mourned her death. I know that it was inevitable, given the nature of the games, but I didn't think it would come so soon. I loved Rue. She reminds me of my younger sisters(when they were younger). I wanted to protect her from everything, including death. I love how her death was written, but I wanted more of her. I wanted there to be some way for her to be able to come out of it. Hearing that she was the oldest of six children only made her death more tragic.  Next to talked about is the proverbial elephant in the room... Peeta. I love Peeta. I wasn't so sure of him at the beginning, but through Katniss' distrust, i actually came to trust him. I could see what she could not see from the very beginning, he meant it when he said he liked her. When she explained his looks at her through their school years, I knew that he liked her. My real frustration is with Katniss at the end of the novel. How could she do that? I thought that she had really grown to love him. Some of the things that she did and said only seemed to indicate how much she loved him. The fact that she said that if she was the one who lived she would never really leave the arena... the fact she risked her life to get the medicine at the feast... everything seemed to indicate that she loved him. And Gale, please, she had chance with him and she didn't take it. He has been in the friend zone too long. She shouldn't even be thinking about him in any way except "I can't wait to see my best friend again" way. My heart broke for Peeta as he was walking away from her on the platform of the train station. I hope that she gets her act together (and quickly) and realizes that he is the one for her~  Perhaps that thing I can identify with the most is the love Katniss has for her younger sister, Primrose. I am the oldest of four girls and I know that I would do anything for my sisters. I would die for them, if that is what was called for. I try to picture myself in Katniss' shoes, when she hears her sisters name be called, and all I can think is that I would have done the exact same thing. In my case, it would have meant certain death (I have no outdoor skills at all) but I would have rather died then spend the rest of my life knowing that I could have saved my sister and I didn't. The protective love that an older sibling feels for a younger one is expertly portrayed here.  I can't imagine what it must have been like to be the parents of any of these characters. To be forced to watch on television while your child gets hunted down and killed. I can't imagine what it must be like to want your child to win, even then realizing that means that they must murder someone else's child. You want your child home safely, but when you are celebrating their continued life, some other mother is crying over the death of their child.  Another question I have is why did the guy from District 11 (I can't remember his name) take the bag belonging to District 2 and why didn't he kill the C guy (gosh I am forgetting names) while he had the chance? It seems to me, and I could be totally wrong about this, that he wanted to draw the guy from District 2 to fight him. He must have known that he would be the target for him after that. My theory, which is probably totally off-base, is that he didn't favor killing and that he had some feeling in his heart for Katniss. I am not saying that he had a crush or anything like that. But he seems to not really favor killing people. He didn't go for the goods in the beginning (obvious because he had no weapon except for the huge rock) and he hid out in the area that no one went into. He did kill Clover, but that seemed to be more because he was getting revenge for the death of little Rue, and even before he let Katniss go, he seemed to be hesitating about killing her. Others probably have far more accurate theories, but that is what I think.  Now another thing I observed about these books is the food colors. Off the top of my head there is the purple melon and the blue grapes. that just seems odd to me. I don't really understand the point of changing the color of common things. Maybe that will come up in the next book.
I've been recommending "The Hunger Games" to everyone I know. The trilogy is one the best series of books I have ever read, but it will NOT give you the warm and fuzzies. I read the entire trilogy in 3 days, and when I finished I went home, took a shower, and went to bad because I was absolutely drained. This book really gets under your skin and it will make you physically uncomfortable. It is disturbing and it challenges your initial thoughts and reactions, so you actually feel guilty for wanting bad things to happen to the characters you don't like. as far as I'm concerned, that's what a good book SHOULD do.  Suzanne Collins does truly awful things to her characters. There is violence, both against and initiated by children, oppression, and plenty of morally-ambiguous gray areas, but in making the characters suffer, Collins makes them grow and the books are superior for that reason. She have strong characters who are cruelly beaten down, but the reader gets to watch Katniss (the protagonist) and co. be awesome bad asses despite all the awfulness they go through.  I do have a few complaints, though. The first half is a bit slow and dull, but once you get through that the action picks up so quickly that you're just begging for the author to slow down and let you catch your breath for a minute. Unfortunately, when she does that 3/4 of the way through, it's to focus on a rather shallow-feeling romance. If you just get through that like I did, the story returns to the gripping, morally ambiguous, fast-paced action book and the romance even becomes more entertaining in "Mockingjay," the third book. Second would be not enough world building--I was dying to know not just about the rest of Panem, the post-apocalyptic future country, but also the world outside of Panem. Finally, the writing style is first-person present. First person is my least favorite form of narrative format, but it's a style that works later on. Collin's choice is totally vindicated when you feel like you're right there with Katniss, even if it is a bit awkward when Katniss is, say, eating.  Others have complained about the book being too similar to "Battle Royale," but having never read that, I cant comment on it. If you haven't read it, then I totally recommend this book no matter what. If you have, then you might be a bit disappointed, but I am so obsessed with this book I'll still recommend it to you. And to any Joss Whedon fans out there, I one million percent recommend this book to you.  Anyways, "The Hunger Games is quite possibly the best children's/young adult book ever (except maybe "The Golden Compass"), though I believe the only real reason it's billed as "young adult," is because it has a 16-year-old protagonist. This is totally a book for adults, no matter what the author says, or what I just said a sentence ago.  [Oh, and I also recommended the "Mark Reads" blog posts on The Hunger Games, though the posts can be a bit repetitive at times as the audience is repeatedly struck speechless by the awesomeness and the horror that is "The Hunger Games." [...]]
The Hunger Games    Have you ever imagined what was to become of us in the future, and what things will happen? Well the hunger games might be the book for you. This book has everything, romance, violence, and suspense. If you're like me you will get hooked to this book. This book has 384 pages of pure awesomeness written by Suzanne Collins.  The whole enchilada    This book was set in the future when civilization was crumbling apart. The hunger games are held every year with two names being drawn from all 12 districts. Some of you that have read this book know what districts are but if you haven't read this book let me fill you in, districts are what we know today as states, today we have a very civilized government but when the new government the "Capital" took power it was all but civilized. Unfortunately Prim (the main characters sister) name was drawn which causes Katniss (the main character) to take her place in the 74th annual Hunger Games, and this isn't no board game, this is full on chaos! It is hunt or be hunted. Oh. And there are some other things that happen, but you won't know until you get this awesome book. So I would definitely recommend this book, unless you're afraid.  Vomit for everyone!    My favorite part in this book is when Katniss and Peeta are on their way to the capital on the train and Haymitch slips and falls into his own puke. I thought this was funny because who would get so drunk they would slip in their own puke! But this isn't the only funny part in this book there are tons more. So if you want a book with a hint of fun the hunger games maybe the book for you.   Smarter than a fifth Grader?    The most important thing I learned from reading this book is that you don't have to be strong or fast, all you have to be is smart.  She has written two more!    Some other books written by Suzanne Collins are, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay these are both award winning books and are the remaining books in The Hunger Games trilogy.  This book is for you, too!    I would recommend this book to anyone in the need of a good book. But would caution anybody under the age of 11 because of violence. This was a GREAT book. So if you think this all sounds good go to your favorite book store or library or even buy it on your new fancy hi-tech e-reader.
I absolutely loved this book and I cannot wait to read the rest of the books in the series.  It did not grab me from the first page, or even the first chapter. I had to read 3 or 4 chapters before I really started getting into it. But once it gets rolling, hang on to your seat, because you are in for a wild ride.  The storyline is quite brutal, and quite frankly I am surprised that this is considered a "Young Adult" book. There's no outright gore that I can remember; the violence is cleaned up a bit. There is no sex here, other than some brief kissing. But there is also no shortage of death and violence. The plot revolves around a fight-to-the-death arena match with 24 contestants ranging in age from 12 to 18. And yes, there are scenes where young people whom I would consider children are killed. So while it didn't bother me, I certainly would not recommend this book to someone who is overly-sensitive to such things. I think some of the later Harry Potter books are pretty dark, but I consider The Hunger Games to be perhaps just a tiny bit more-so.  Having said that, I'm an adult (age 40) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story is great, the characters both in and out of the arena seem deep and real and other than the initial ramp-up in the beginning, there was never a single dull moment.  The contestants are not cardboard cut-outs for the heroine to knock down, they each have realistic strengths and weaknesses and often surprise the reader with their depth.  The action is well-written, entertaining, and often more than a little heart-wrenching. But even before the action starts, there are deep moral questions to contemplate. The heroine faces emotional challenges and political intrigue before she even gets to the arena.  I don't want to give too much away, but all-in-all, this is a thoroughly enjoyable, but often dark and brutal read. I highly recommend it to adults for sure and teenagers, also, as long as they are not overly empathic. If they can handle the last 3 books in the Harry Potter series, they can probably handle this, as well.
Blurb - "Katniss is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister in the poorest district of Panem, the remains of what used be the United States. Long ago the districts waged war on the Capitol and were defeated. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called, "The Hunger Games." The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. When Kat's sister is chosen by lottery, Kat steps up to go in her place."  I have a love/hate relationship with this book. I really loved it while I was reading it, I felt compelled to finish and I did it in one day. But when I was done I felt almost a sense of despair and wondered if there was anything good about the book at all. To start with, this book is full of heartbreak. It's just one thing after another. The fact that the Tributes (the boys and girls chosen by lottery per District to play in the Games) live a life of hunger and poverty before being forced to fight to the death in the Games if pretty awful. Then Prim is chosen for the games even though Katniss has her name in the lottery many more times. There's the whole reason behind why her name is in the lottery that many times. Then the sort-of romance (if one can call anything that happens in the Arena romantic).  This book is just chock full of misery and doubt and remorse. It's also a rather harsh parody of modern society and our love for reality television shows, extreme violence, and glorification of celebrities.  I can't decide if I want to continue with the series. I think it could be interesting to see how Collins resolves the central relationships, and what happens after the Games have been shaken up. There's obviously seeds of revolution that will be sowed. Apparently the next book shows the huge discrepancy between those who live in the Capitol (where the governing body resides) and those who struggle in the districts. There's obviously a huge gap in technology and I'd like to see the hows and whys of that.  All in all I'd recommend the book, but with warnings of the negativity and violence.
I don't watch much TV, and I especially don't watch any reality TV. I find it distasteful for all of the obvious reasons - the non-sensical use of "reality" to describe something that is little more than loosely scripted "entertainment" ridiculously acted out by people who are hyper aware of their roles and work for peanuts (which is to say, a shot at 15 minutes of hollow fame). For me, this was one of the most intriguing aspects of The Hunger Games.  Even in as close to a real-life scenario as one could conceive, a fight to the death Battle Royale pitting teens and tweens against each other, the ugly head of false-reality TV has its limitations. In the Games, which are put on by an oppressive Captiol set in a futuristic dystopia to keep its satellite Districts in line and remind them of a long-ago failed rebellion, the idea is to titillate the out of touch elite of the Haves and punish the District Have-not rubes by constantly reminding them under whose thumb they exist. But the Games are the ultimate deus ex machina as the Capitol's Gamemakers ensure the action never lacks by manipulating everything from the environment to players' own emotions.  So while the threat of death is constant and the danger is very real, there's the element of unreality that pervades the whole scene. The way the main character, Katniss, tries to juggle real emotion with the manufactured kind that comes with "playing the game" was very well done.  The fact that the Gamemakers could at any time manipulate the game to their will basically meant that the author could at any time manipulate the plot to her will, and that unfortunately gave the entire story a deflated or muted intensity. Just as the Gamemakers can force the action, the author can save the day just in the nick of time with surprise gifts from sponsors who are watching the games and decide they want to pony up some cash and buy their favorite competitors some assistance. This provided more than one anti-climactic moment and broke what was otherwise great tension throughout the novel.  But for a YA novel, this is very well written and explores many themes that you may not expect to find in youth fiction. And really, I'm probably just over-analyzing this whole thing, because the book is simply a great, absorbing read. The love triangle it sets up for the next book doesn't exactly entice me, but then it wasn't written with me, a middle aged dude, in mind. I get that and I'm cool with it, and I'll definitely move on to Catching Fire.
Katniss Everdeen has been taking care of her family ever since her father was killed-before her eyes-by a mine. She, along with her friend Gale, has been illegally sneaking out of her District and into the woods to hunt and bring back the meat necessary for their survival. She does this most of all because of her love for Prim, her younger sister. The day of the Reaping arrives as it does each year, when two children from each District are chosen to fight to the death while being televised to the entire population. Against all odds, Prim is chosen and Katniss knows that she has to protect her sister once again-by taking her place. Coming from District 12, the coal-mining district, Katniss has little chance of winning. District 12 has only won once. But maybe, with a little luck and a surprise alliance Katniss has a shot. If she can get herself to kill her competitors. Especially if she might love one of them.  Collins does an incredible job of weaving this dystopian world where things are run by the Capitol for the best of and the amusement of the Capitol. The one thing the Capitol can be counted on doing is finding ways to remind the Districts that they must obey. Or else.  The characters are so real and sympathetic that it's hard not to cry at the moment when Prim's name is reaped. You feel very keenly Katniss's desperation, confusion, and anger at the things that have befallen her family.  The story is written in first person present, which really threw me at first, since it's so rare. It took me a while to get used to it and in the beginning I thought I really disliked it. But once I got used to it, I didn't notice it anymore and it made the rest of the story feel closer and more resounding. I will definitely be picking up Catching Fire as soon as I can get my hands on it (which will likely be after work today). I can't wait to see what happens next and how Katniss takes to her life after everything.
Okay, to start off with... I think that if "My Side of the Mountain" by Jean George, "The Uglies" series by Scott Westerfeld, "Shade's Children" by Garth Nix, and "The Giver" by Louis Lowry were to have a child together (don't ask me how four books could have a child together, I am not a rocket scientist, I am a mere book blogger ;) ), this book would be the result (plus with a little bit of "The Truman Show" film thrown into the genetic mixture).  When I first picked up this book and started reading it, I noticed that the writing of the book isn't similar to anything I have ever read before. It doesn't flow quite like the girly paranormal stories I gravitate towards (ie. "Paranormalcy" and things along those lines). I find the writing to be a lot choppier and blunter, but it fits the premise of the book perfectly, since this book isn't about a happy-go-lucky society, but the epitome of a dystopian society. I'm not going to lie, I didn't adjust to this writing style until a good 30 pages into the book, but now as I read the later books in the series, I don't even notice the difference in writing.  Usually when I read a series where a female character is torn between whether she wants to be with her best friend/ old friend who she can see herself in a relationship with because he is comfortable and safe, versus the new boy who comes into her life who is super mysterious and all, I typically root for the new boy. My philosophy...? If you haven't gotten together in all of the time that you have been friends, why now at this random point in time does he start to show an interest in you? Just because the new boy came along and he feels like he needs to stake his claim? Therefore I am quite surprised at my reaction to this book. I seriously don't know who I want Katniss to end up with... Gale or Peeta... And also, I have read tons of reviews and plot summaries of this book, but it completely escapes me who she chooses (so it's nice that it will be a complete surprise to me at the end of the series).  Also, I am rather enjoying that all of the books are out in this series. Usually when I start a series I start when the first book is released and then I have to wait years upon years for the remaining books to be released, so it's just really nice not to have to mope around the house wondering what happens to my favourite characters (it doesn't try my patience).  Usually I am a little iffy towards the secondary characters- a lot of the time I could take them or leave them, however, in this series I find myself liking most, if not all, of the secondary characters and think that they contribute wholeheartedly to the series, especially Haymitch Abernathy. I mean first off, he is a secondary character which is bad in my books, then he is a drunk, which is even worse in my eyes, but... I cannot help but love him. He means well and does everything in his power to protect Peeta and Katniss, so I can forgive him for all of his vices and faults, plus the man is clearly a genius. And President Coriolanus Snow? Oh gosh... This man makes me so gosh darn angry, but I wouldn't change him at all. He is the most perfect bad guy if I ever did see one and Ru? Well, her fate was probably the hardest to come to terms with- she just seemed like such a little ball of energy. Cinna? Well, I think that if he were a real life person that we would be bffl's.  So all in all, if you like a ton of action and adventure, then this book is clearly for you. Throw in a bit of romance (but not too much/ too cheesy), a unique plot line, and you have the perfect combination for a great book!
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  You lose, you die!  *****    When I looked at the "Hunger Games" book, I thought it would be about who could go the longest without eating any food. The book was a story of intense survival.  It was full of excitement, blood, and a path to survival. The book was nothing compared to what I thought it would be.  It was much better! The book had many dramatic turns, including a great one right after the actual games started.  This is a book of fiction written by Suzanne Collins.  It is set in the future in a nation called Panem.  Panem has a place called the Capitol where all the people who live there are rich and it has 12 districts where peasants and other poor people live. The Capitol has an annual event known as the Hunger Games.    Every year, each of the 12 districts must send one girl and one boy between the ages of 12 and 18 to the Hunger Games.  They are sent into an arena, where they fight to the death.  It is watched on live television. The winner becomes famous, and if you lose, you die. This isn't just people fighting one-on-one.  The contestants, they are called tributes, are put in large arenas intended to look like places in nature. The tributes have to fight each other, the weather conditions, and different things set up by the people in charge of the games.  The goal is to stay alive. The children from the district are fighting to death for the enjoyment of the rich people who like violence.    The main character was Katniss, a girl who volunteered to go to the games so her younger sister would not have to go.  Peeta is the boy from the same district as Katniss.  They work together, but in the end there can only be one winner.    I liked the book because it had a lot of violence in it during the competitions.  I also liked the book because it was scary, and I always wondered what was going to happen next, like when the fire balls were about to kill Katniss.   In closing I had a lot of fun reading the book. It will have you wanting to read the sequel, so I recommend that you read this book if you ever get the chance. I feel that this book is good for people in the age group of twelve to forty years old.
I'm not sure that words can adequately express how much I enjoyed--and am still enjoying, since I've actually only finished the first 2 books while I'm waiting for the 3rd from Amazon--this series!  Hunger Games is obviously the first book, so it is our first foray into Katniss and all her adventures. One thing I would definitely say to anyone who picks up this book--commit to finishing this book. If you don't like the first book, then you might not like the rest, but don't give up if in Part 1 of this book you are not sucked in. I wasn't. For one thing, it took me a little while to warm up to Katniss--she's a GREAT character, and I love her, but when she first came on the scene, she was a little rough around the edges and at times, a little difficult to like. She's hardened, suspicious, not precisely the 17 year old you would expect, but the more you learn about her world, the more she makes sense. Part 1 didn't impress me. Part 2 sucked me in, and by the time I got to Part 3, I couldn't even put the book down to go to bed knowing I had to work in four hours. On my lunch break, I had to buy the second book. It's one of those books. Once you get pulled in, you don't want to put it down--ever. The ONLY complaint I have about this book (other than one weird part at the end of this book, which is resolved in the 2nd book) or the series in general is that it does not go on forever.  The characters are great--it's so hard to decide who you like best, because you just like them all in different ways. The plot is concise, it moves along without dragging and lingering too long, so it's impossible to lose interest.  Whether your preferred author is Stephenie Meyer or George Orwell, there's something in this book for everybody!  One thing: while fantastic, it isn't for very young readers. Normally when I think of YA I think safe for kids 9-12, but this one isn't; I would definitely encourage only readers maybe 14/15 (depending on the kid) or older to read this one.  Down with the Capitol! :)
I'm glad I didn't know what this book was going to be about because I probably wouldn't have read it- I don't normally like dystopian, violent stuff. But this book is so much more than that: it has action, adventure, love, growth. Instead of being depressing, it captivates you. I read this first book in one night and afterward I realized I'm going to continue reading Young Adult fiction for the rest of my life.  Drawing on the story of Theseus, the book has many smart characters all constantly adapting to survive. The protagonist Katniss is strong, independent, and resourceful. Her irreverent voice is hilarious, making you laugh even when you're ready to cry or when your heart is pounding in suspense. Everything is so intelligently written, nothing simply gratuitous. The fighting is described intelligently and caused me to strategize about how I'd behave in the same situation. Fashion also plays a surprisingly important role in the story, beautiful but also with strategic value in conveying ideas. There were just so many different elements, all creative and interesting.  This series has one of the strongest narrative arcs I've read in a long time. I rarely read more than 1 book of a series because after the first book I often feel I know what's going to happen next, and I feel like most of the world has been revealed so there's not many new ideas left. This series is different. Even though I succumbed to my bad habit of googling the remaining plot, I was as surprised and riveted by books 2 and 3 as I was by book 1. Katniss changes from focusing on her own survival to fighting for her community and an idea of freedom. While book 1 focuses on Katniss battling tooth and nail for her own survival, in the other books the conflict changes to include Katniss and her friends vs Panem, Katniss sacrificing herself and her own desires for her loved ones and for her ideals. It also has a love story that Collins has brilliantly integrated into the central plot so that it's powerful and moving rather than predictable or absurd. This is not a book where the characters get together by the end of the first book after some misunderstanding and then live happily ever after- they go through a lot.  I loved this book and I wish I could give it more stars.
"They're already taking my future! They can't have the things that mattered to me in the past!"  Katniss Everdeen lives in a dystopic future where North America is now called Panem, the continent is divided into one Capitol, "ruling district", and twelve other subservient districts.  Katniss and her family mostly ekes out a living in District 12, sometimes barely surviving.  But when Katniss' beloved younger sister is called out for the Hunger Games, a yearly event where a boy and a girl from each district participate in a fight-to-the-death match, Katniss takes her sister's place.  Will Katniss survive?  I Liked:  If I had to write the perfect book, it would probably contain these elements: a strong-willed, independent girl, some sort of journey or adventure or chase away from "bad guys", a big "life or death" battle, and a very laid-back romance with a realistic boy (Edward Cullen need not apply).  Well, whaddya know, this book exists and it's name is "The Hunger Games"!  Katniss Everdeen is definitely the "strong-willed, independent girl" I like to read about.  She's smart, she's quick-thinking, she's resourceful, but she still has faults.  Her communications skills are a bit lacking.  She's brusque.  She can't lie.  She can't charm people.  She doesn't have a D-cup with a Perfect Size 6.  Probably my favorite type of story is a journey or "chase" story.  I love stories where a character has to run away from some bad guy, to survive by her wits and sheer dumb luck.  What Katniss has to endure is precisely that: she must survive the Hunger Games, which means running away from the other 23 tributes that are trying to kill her, trying to hunt the tributes and kill them first, and to feed and provide water and protection for herself.  Not to mention, the big "life or death" battle she must face and try to survive, which I won't detail any more for fear of divulging the hideous spoilers.  And then romance.  Honestly, what girl doesn't want to see a little bit of romance in a book, particularly when it is well done and not the horrible Romantic Triangle or Romantic Stalker that seems so popular nowadays.  For fear of giving away too much, I loved how we were never sure if Peeta really was in love with Katniss or if it was his big ploy to get sponsors.  Plus, Peeta is definitely a charming romantic lead: if he is in love with Katniss, how sweet and romantic!  How he looks out for her and puts her ahead of him!  And yet, he doesn't exhibit crazy stalker behavior and can still argue and chide her like a real human being.  And while I didn't include this in my Top Factors for the Best Story ever, I do love stories that make a statement about today's culture.  I couldn't help relating the Hunger Games to the billion of stupid reality TV shows on today.  I also thought the way the districts were grouped were very similar to how distant our country has grown.  And the vapid Capitol culture hardly felt like future dystopia to me at all...I swear to God, I see this sort of insipid behavior every day.  I Didn't Like:  I found very little to dislike about this book.  In fact, about the only thing that bugged me was the concept of the Hunger Games itself.  I found it a little difficult to believe that this event could possibly keep the twelve districts from revolting.  Wouldn't it do the exact opposite, make the districts more likely to revolt?  Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:  Did they swear?  If there was, it was very mild and very sparse.  The clothes the tributes wear to interviews and such is said to be skimpy at times.  Katniss is told to behave as if she is in love with Peeta and exchanges a few kisses with him.  Very violent.  There are several deaths in this book, though that shouldn't be too unexpected, given the cover blurb.  Not to mention, several characters end up with nasty burns, knife wounds, and wasp bites.  Overall:  Saying this is an amazing book doesn't quite do this book justice.  This book was so good, that I went out to buy the boxed set in hardcover when I already owned The Hunger Games in paperback.  This book was so good, in effect, that I broke my OCD rule of buying in paperback, just so I could read Catching Fire and Mockingjay without waiting forever for those to come out in paperback.  So, do yourself a favor, go out, buy the trilogy in boxed set and make sure you have a day or two to read them, because once you get started, there is no turning back.  Brought to you by:  *C.S.

Just read a few reviews of this amazing book, and was annoyed that in the first 3 I chose, they talk about what happens in the second and third books!  In one, they actually say what happens in the end of the last book!!!  I wish there was a button to submit spoiler reviews. So, I will talk only about what happens in the very beginning of the book, and hopefully you will be as enthralled as I, without learning too much in the review.  So, back to the topic at hand: Hunger Games.  I don't often find an immediate bond with a book, but the Hunger Games had me hooked on the very first page. Suzanne's Young Adult novel is rich with characterization, suspense, and imagery.  There is a very chaste romance, but nothing more than quick kisses make the grade.  The story begins with teenager Katniss Everdeen  having just returned home from hunting illegally.  In her town, called "District 12" (a division of North American towns sometime in the future), most of the residents are starving.  The meat, vegetables, fruits and herbs she trades on the black market keep her family fed- though just barely.  You learn early on, that there is an evil "big brother" type of government in another district that is punishing all other districts for rebelling, by keeping food supplies low, making trading obsolete, imprisoning the residents of each district in a walled off community, and forcing each district to draft one boy and one girl into a death match called the Hunger Games.  The way the boys and girls are chosen is through a raffle. Starting at the age of 12, every child's name is submitted, and each year after, their name is entered double the amount of times as the previous year.  If he or she chooses, each teen can submit their name extra times, receiving bonus supplies for each time their name has been submitted. Our heroine Kat, enters her name to gather these goods, which will allow her family to survive.  Soon, the book takes us to the center of town, where residents are nervously clutching their children and saying silent prayers that their names will not be called by the chirpy emcee. This year Kat's younger sister Primrose will be entered into the competition for the very first time. They know that the games pit 24 children against each other, in the woods far off in an unknown location, and televise the long, brutal death match to the entire "country".  The perception of these games differs greatly based upon who is watching.  The people of the districts wait in horror to see if the one child who survives the game above all others with be their own.  The rulers of the land find the sport ever so thrilling and eagerly await the games each year. Will Kat, Primrose or one of their close friends be called upon to be this year's "tribute"? Read and find out!!
I have been hearing about The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins for quite some time.  When I was reading the Twilight series most of my friends said that if I liked those books I would LOVE The Hunger Games.  My oldest son actually started reading them a long time before I did and said the same thing.  He was so excited for me to start reading them.  Then just before Christmas I found a Kindle App for my phone.  Yes, it took my phone being able to download the book to get me to read it.  What can I say, I'm an Android junkie!  I downloaded the book on Thursday afternoon.  That was my first mistake, because I had to work the next day.  I ended up staying up all night reading the book and finishing it by 4:00 am on Friday.  Then I had to get up at 6:00 am to try and work.  Luckily I work from home and my wonderful partner &amp; boyfriend let me take a nap during the day.  I made him a promise that I wouldn't download or start reading the next book in the series until the following weekend so I wouldn't be so tired during work hours.  Yes, the book is THAT good!  I absolutely loved it!  It's been a long time since I have read a book that not only kept me awake not wanting to put it down, but made me want to run out and get the second and third books to continue the story.  Needless to say, I was finished with the entire series in less than a week!  The characters are amazing.  The storyline, while not completely unique, is compelling and draws you into the characters lives like you are living it with them.  There are also so many twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat (or bed, depending on where you are reading) that you can't guess what's going to happen next.  I highly recommend this book to just about anyone over the age of 12 or 13.  My boys love the books.  All of my friends and their teens love the books.  It is a great story for anyone of almost any age.  Beware, there is a lot of violence.... gross, graphic violence!  But it's definitely needed for the story, so it's not gratuitous violence.  If they made it into a movie (which they are planning on doing) it would probably have to be rated R if they kept with the violence, but still defintely needed!  But if you start reading this book, you WILL want to read the other two, so you might as well buy the whole set at once.  LOL!
I wasn't immediately interested in this trilogy.  I looked at them several times on the Kindle Top List.  But, the idea of kids killing kids is not really enjoyment for me, and I wasn't a huge fan of the movie "The Running Man" (based on the Stephen King Book) and I was afraid that this book was going to be like it or remind me of it and feel like a knock off.  Then I had several friends tell me how amazing the books were.  So I sampled it on my Kindle and was intrigued.  I bought the book and read it in a a day and a half.  I read every free moment I had.  My friends were right.  It was a great book.  It was an intriguing story and it was fast paced.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end and immediately sampled the next book just to get me by until I have time to read again, when I will buy that one too.  I think what I liked most about the book was that Suzanne Collins writes in a way so that you are not reading a story so much as immersed INTO it by how she tells the story.  It reminds of the Twilight Series in how they are written in first person and detailed in a way that you feel you are the character and experience as they are.  You simply get lost and feel like you are on Katniss' side as a silent partner as she goes through this crazy experience. The characters are all interesting as well and how they interact is equally entertaining.  WARNING....if you want to get through The Hunger Games with no spoilers, don't read the description for the next book, "Catching Fire" until you are done.  While I had a feeling how the story was going to end before it was revealed, I read the description for Catching Fire and found via the description I was going to be right.  It didn't ruin the story for me but had I known that I wouldn't have looked at it.
The Hunger Games = WOW! Absolutely fantastic. I couldn't put this book down. First, for those of you who haven't been fortunate enough to read it yet, here is the back cover blurb:  "In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before--and survival, for here, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love."  I'll be honest, after reading this blurb, this didn't sound like my type of book. I've never really been into dystopian fiction, or dystopian YA fiction. However, I'd heard so many great reviews of this series that I finally bought the book and just had to see for myself.  I literally COULD NOT put this book down. My fiance had to finally pry it from my hands, so I would finish up studying for my finals and writing my final papers. Word to the wise, if you have something important to do, don't start reading this book because you won't get it done--save it for a nice weekend read.  The Hunger Games is addicting. Not only is the story full of non-stop action and adventure, but the novel is very well written and will keep you on the edge of your seat and in love with the characters from page one. I can't say enough good things about this book. It is definitely being archived on my shelf as one of my new favorites, and I've already bought the two sequel books (Catching Fire and Mockingjay).  This book appeals to any one of any age, whether or not you are usually a sci-fi dystopian reader--this is a book for anyone.  This book is absolutely fantastic, and if you don't like it, there must be something wrong with you. Lol, just kidding about that last part, but seriously, this book is great and you NEED to read it. I give it my highest recommendation.  So for those of you who haven't read the novel, run to your local bookstore this very second and buy this book! You will not regret it.
There were things that I loved and things I hated about this book. I hopped on the Hunger Games train a lot later than most of my fellow book bloggers, but thanks to all of you I was convinced I had to give it a try.  When I was writing this review I made a pros and cons list, because I kept sitting down to write it and ending up with 2-3 pages worth of gushing and ranting. Maybe it's that The Hunger Games is so widely known, and everyone already has something to say about it...  So anyway, let's talk characters.  The characters truly made the story for me. Don't get me wrong, the plot was made of awesomesauce, but the characters are what I won't be forgetting anytime soon.  Peeta...where have you been all my life? If i go in-depth about Peeta it's just going to make me sound like a bubbling fan girl. So I'll just say that i was very impressed by Peeta.  Katniss Everdeen, is my hero. You don't know how relieved I was to finally find a self-reliant female young adult character. I kind of feel like I'm complaining but with all the YA romances it's getting a little annoying how many Bella Swans are popping up (no offense to the twi-hards). Although Katniss gets her emotions mixed up a lot I feel that she's a great role model for young girls.  Rue was a character who's role at first may seem small, but later on it becomes apparent that she makes a big impact not only on Katniss, but on all of Panem. Rue was one of my favorite characters and when she died it brought me to tears.  What i hated about this book was all the violence. I'm not one to complain about a little blood here and there. The wild dogs tearing people apart limb by limb i could handle but did a little girl really have to get killed? Yes i know it sets up a lot of the story...but still that scene was just heartbreaking, no matter how you cut it.  In the arena everything changes. The ones who make it out are changed forever. Some of those scenes were so intense I'm almost convinced they changed me just by reading them.  The Hunger Games was an interesting, complicated and sometimes scary story. It was one of the best starts to a series I've seen in a while.
There are already so many reviews, I feel it will be almost pointless for me to add my two cents but I enjoyed this book too much not to do so.  I've just, less than 10 minutes ago, finished reading the book. I suppose I shouldn't be reviewing already and I should really let my emotions settle but...  So, I can't really think of anything I didn't like about the book right now... The writing was clear, prose flowed beautifully, characters well developed, plot intriguing... hmm...  I will warn that this is a dark, twisted dystopia. The minds behind the Capitol are extremely messed up! Yet, although it's based on a future world, some of the human characteristics and acts apply even today and have for a long time- think of the 'games' at the Colosseum in Roman times. Think watching Fear Factor, Survivor, I'm a Celebrity, Get me out of here! or even the death defying stunts at a circus, air show or just Evel Knievel- the accident you can't look away from, the fascination of watching someone put their lives at risk or doing something completely gross or terrifying. Now up that by the power of future technology. Now multiply by child soldiers - it's disturbing and takes your breath away as you follow these kids' stories, struggling to remember your own humanity.  But for me, one of the most poignant bits comes near the end of the book - the way the people of the Capitol remember the Games. To them, the deaths are entertaining, unreal. To them, it's so cool to see how one child killed another in some clever way - they don't stop to think that a child was forced to kill another child in order to survive or how wrong it is to put any human being through that for entertainment or of how it must be for the families left behind.  I can't say enough about this book. 'Fortunately' I can't quite afford the next two books yet - fortunate because I kind of abandoned real life and sleep because I couldn't 'put this book down'. My poor Kindle needs sleep too I think lol
This is a review of the whole trilogy, as I read them the one directly after the other and I find it very difficult to separate the stories. The cover pictured is from my actual book (isn't it beautiful?)    As most of you know, this is a series of three dystopian novels: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. The are about a future America where there are no United States, only 13 districts where poverty rules and the Capitol, where a dictator-like president lives and thrives along with the pampered, rich people. This president has established The Hunger Games which occur once every year, with the purpose of entertainment to the population of the Capitol, and the purpose of punishing and keeping in line the districts. The first novel in the series begins when the heroine, Katniss goes to the Hunger Games to fight with other 23 people (a boy and a girl from each of the 12 districts, including a boy from her own district) to the death. Because only one boy or girl can survive the Hunger Games.  But this year it's different.    I loved these books. Of course, let it be known that they contain a lot of blood and violence, and as that they are not suitable for children or teenagers.    I loved the revolution, I think it is the most up-to-date concept. I loved the parallels between this dystopian society and our own. I loved Katniss' spunk and courage in the face of every impossibility. And I loved that she never stoped believing that, even though something had never happened before, it could happen this once, for her, for the people she cared about, for the first time. This faith, even though it deteriorated by the end, was what pulled her through everything.  I also enjoyed the love story, and found it very realistic and accurate. I didn't find a love triangle in these books, like other readers have thought, I don't think there exists one. As for Katniss' behaviour, it was only natural that she should be concerned first about her survival (and Peeta's) and then about falling in love and making out. I think this was out of the question for her in the majority of all three books.    There was one thing I didn't like, and that was the death of a character in Mockingjay, the final book, because I thought it was unessecary and didn't do anything to help the plot along. On the contrary, I think the author might have found herself with a character she created that was by far superior to the protagonists, and didn't know what to do with him, because he overshadowed them. So, she killed him off. That is a very poor reason to kill a character, and I have seen it in other books. I think it shows lack of strength and skill in the part of the author.    I also wanted to say here, as far as the ending of the trilogy is concerned, that is to say part of the final book, that I really liked how the revolution went on, the contrasts between the old world and the new one they wanted to built, but also the similarities. I think that is very true, because human nature always tend to fall in the same mistakes, and power does something strange to people, even those with the best intetions. It has the potential to make them evil and that was beautifully portrayed in these books.    This book was something to think about for days after you finished the trilogy, not something fun to enjoy. If every reader who gets a hold of this book should then think of even one thing concerning themselves, then that would be time well spent.  One last thing.    The modern-day arena really interigued me when I first decided I wanted to read these books, so I went ahead and bought them, even though I was afraid they would be depressing (which they aren't, surprisingly enough. They are really encouraging overall.). However, I thought that in this arena there wasn't much to root for, since the kids only fought for survival. Now, if there had been something else at stake, like there was for Christians in the arena at Roman times, their beliefs, or something, that would be something to get excited about. That's what I thought, personally, although admittedly, in the second and third books, there is indeed much more going on than mere survival. That's what made their angst and struggles so exciting for the reader.  These books prove that, as I always believed, if there is something worth living for, then that same thing must be worth dying for, and even more so.  Rating: The Hunger Games 5/5  Catching Fire 4.5/5  Mockingjay 3/5  The Trilogy 4/5  [...]
I'm going to put the reviews of all 3 books together because I'd like people to know what they are getting into by picking up the first book. Had I known it myself, I wouldn't have purchased The Hunger Games.  Book 1 was great. It was amazing. I loved the writing, the creativity, the plot. I think it would be a good idea to ready food and drinks by the bed before diving into the book because really, the book was unputdownable. Oh, and tissue papers as well, as the book constantly moved me to tears.  [SPOILERS]  However, I was not aware of the fact that by reading The Hunger Games, I was signing myself up to a sort-of romance novel, which was a genre I had absolutely zero interest in reading. Worse, it was another girl-can't-decide-which-boy-she-loves-more-so-she-leads-them-on-and-claims-them-both romance novel.  The love triangle thing was sudden and not entirely believable, but the majority of the book was focused on life in District 12, hunting, and the actual Hunger Games, which equaled lots of actions, which was what I signed up for, so I had a great time reading Book 1 (minus the romance).  I should have seen this coming, but silly me held on to the hope that maybe the love triangle thing wouldn't be so prominent in Book 2. But I was wrong. Very wrong. While I could barely part with my Kindle when I was devoting Book 1 in one sitting, Book 2 could barely hold my attention. Whenever the romance got too unbearable, I found myself spacing out and wanting to fall asleep, which was quite often. I can't say I enjoyed reading Book 2.  By the time I finished Book 2, I had lost most of my interest in the story, not only because of the romance, but here and there, things just... happened. Some of these things were boring, some didn't make sense. Sure, the second Games was great, although not as good as the first one. And I did shed tears once. But comparing to Book 1, Book 2 did not have whatever it was that captivated me and made me finish reading Book 1 in one sitting like there was no tomorrow.  I purchased Book 3 simply because I wanted to finish what I started. I wanted to know how the story ended, although I took so little pleasure in reading it that I skimmed quite some passages. If I thought Book 2 was worse than Book 1, Book 3 was a disaster. I found myself reading things a mentally unstable Katniss did and thought about, which, while I was sure added to the character's depth or something, not what I signed up for nor cared to read about. I wanted actions, which did not happen often in Book 3, and when they did happen, not entirely convincing or nearly powerful enough.  With the almighty Capitol so easy to penetrate and fall, it was like watching a badly made movie where they tried to squeeze in a lot of special effects but failed to edit out the green screen entirely. It was like watching a good story went to waste.  Katniss reminded me of Bella from Twilight. And I dislike both characters. But at the very least, Twilight had a good ending which I kept going back to re-read over and over again, while Mockingjay's felt like... failure could be too harsh a word, so I'd say unaccomplished instead. I have no desire to re-read these books at all.  Suzanne is, no doubt, a gifted author, and readers who enjoy romance and love triangles are highly likely to love these books. But for readers who want pure actions and/or don't care so much for those female characters who can't decide which boy she wants to keep, think twice before hitting the buy button.
The Hunger Games is definitely one of my favorite books. Every time I read it, I am sucked into this dystopian world that Suzanne Collins has created. I just love the way that she writes. As one chapter ends, I find myself starting the next chapter even though I promised myself I would read only one more chapter and then get back to the real world.  The main character, Katniss, is amazing. I love that she is a strong, independent girl who is smart and has great survival instincts. After her father died, she even took it upon herself to take care of her family by hunting for food even though it is illegal. She loves her little sister, Prim, more than anything, and she does everything in her power to protect her even when it involves risking her own life. The only reason she becomes a contender in the 74th annual Hunger Games is because she took her sister's place. The Capitol is horrible to force 12 girls and 12 boys to fight to the death in the Hunger Games! It takes reality TV to a whole new level. I could not even imagine having to watch these games each year. The violence that Katniss had to witness and live through is horrendous, but it does make for a great book.  The Hunger Games is the type of book that stays with you long after you finish reading it. It is such an exciting story full of action, adventure, and violence. There are some parts that are so suspenseful that the story will have you on the edge of your seat devouring the pages to discover what happens next. The story makes you think about what you would do if you had to live in a world like that. The ending always leaves me wanting more, so I cannot stop myself from immediately picking up Catching Fire to read. It is no surprise that this book is a quick read and an addicting series. I definitely recommend reading it.
In the distant future, the former United States has become the nation of Panem-- a collection of 12 districts ruled by an omnipotent Capitol. Every year the Capitol requires the each district to provide one boy and one girl tribute for the Hunger Games as punishment for a rebellion led 75 years ago by a mysterious 13th district. In the Games, the 24 tributes fight until only one victor remains alive, and the entire event is televised for the Capitol's viewing pleasure.    This tyrannical political environment is the backdrop for Suzanne Collin's The Hunger Games trilogy. The series follows the adventures of Katniss Everdeen, who gets pulled in to the violence and political intrigue of the Games when she volunteers as a tribute to save her little sister, Prim.    What truly impressed me about this book is that Katniss is such an incredibly written female character. She is the primary provider for her household, and she does this by hunting wild game outside of the fence surrounding her home in District 8. Not only is she a well-trained and talented archer, she has a keen survivalist instinct that actually makes her a contender in the Hunger Games-- something very uncommon with tributes from her district.  Katniss' only flaw-- if you can call it that-- is that she is emotionally unaware. Most of the conflict in the book (aside from the obvious) has to do with her misunderstanding other people's intentions, her difficulty in forgiving others, and not being sure how she really feels. This makes her a non-stereotypical heroine in my opinion. Women are usually squishy and dramatic, but Katniss is neither. She is bold, brash, and spunky. She is also unfailingly loyal to her friends and family. Katniss' character manages to be noble without being annoying, which makes it easy for the reader to cheer her on through the ordeal.    The male characters are generally less complex, but they are far more emotionally aware than Katniss, which makes for an interesting dynamic. Gale Hawthorne is Katniss' friend and hunting partner from District 8. He too supports his family since his father and Katniss' father were killed in a mine accident several years ago. Frustrated with conditions in District 8, Gale uses their time outside of the fence to vent and say things that would be considered very treacherous. Opposite Gale is Peeta Mellark, the son of a baker, who becomes Katniss' fellow tribute in the Games. He is a quiet fellow who inadvertently gave Katniss the will to survive when her father died. Although Katniss doesn't know Peeta well, he has a lot more going on beneath his quiet exterior than she knows.    The characters spark, and the narrative catches fire. Everything in this book is dynamic and thrilling. Even the most reserved characters have a strength and a will that make them incredibly compelling.  Readers will find themselves swept up by the story in no time-- The Hunger Games trilogy is truly a high-interest read.
I bought this book a while ago, trying to get my eight grader on to something other than Percy Jackson. A Rick Riordan fan to the core, the kid said, "It's good..." and shoved the book in a drawer. What he'd told me of the plot--a future North America called Panem where 12 districts (the 13th was destroyed) are punished each year for a past uprising by having two children from each district pitted against each in a continent-wide reality show in a fight to the death. It sounded good but I had a lot in my to be read stack.  Fast forward to now. I'm working at a middle school and as I catch snatches of the reading conferences, there is much talk of this series. No matter what book I'm dragging around, the kids' question is always the same: "Have you read The Hunger Games?" I'm glad to say that next week I'll be able to apply in the affirmative (while scouring the class library for a copy of Catching Fire).  This book reminds me of it's title: lean, intensive and even brutal. The writing is sparse but powerful, but the characterization is rich and satisfying. Katniss Everdeen lost her father to the mines. Kat's father, who taught her to hunt, told her which plants to eat and sang so true that even the birds gave pause, was a man respected in district 12. And yet, when Kat's mother slips into depression and the food runs out, no one save the baker's son is willing to help her. At the cost of a black eye and bruised face, Peeta burns two loaves of bread and tosses one to Kat. It is her first gift and she never knows how to repay it.  The next gift is Gale, a tall, true boy whose rabbit snares she admires in the forest. He calls her Catnip since she mumbled her name the first time he ever asked. They share knowledge first and then food. Soon, they are a team, shooting a deer together that nets a maimed goat for Kat's little sister Prim, an angelic being loved by all. Gale talks of running away and living in the woods, but they both know they won't, not with so many mouths to feed (Gale has little brothers and neither his or Kat's mother seem to be very useful). Gale's father died in the same explosion as Kat's father did.  Kat tries to be calm as the lottery for the Hunger Games approaches. Both she and Gale have had to put their name in extra times to get the monthly tessarae to keep the family from starving to death. A ration of rough grain and a few supplies shouldn't be worth a person's life, but in district 12, that's the reality. Gale's name will be in over forty times. Kat's name is entered twenty. Sweet Prim, who Kath no longer takes hunting because she wanted to heal everything, is the only same one. Kat has made sure that Prim never took tessarae for the family. It's Prim first year to have her name entered, being twelve. Her name will go in twice, when she is thirteen, and once more each year until 18, when she will be safe. Kat's job? To stay alive that long so that she can feed Prim. (Although Gale and Kat have a deal to feed the other's family if one of them are killed in the games).  What happens, however, is something that Kat could have never planned for, even in her worst nightmare. The name called is an Everdeen, but it isn't her. It's Prim. Screaming and pushing through the crowd of children who have already parted for her, Kat rushes to the stage to volunteer. She has hardly had time to think about what has happened when the boy tribute is named--Peeta, the boy with the bread, the boy who saved her from starving.  This is the conflict that keeps the book going, that and Kat's character. Peeta says that she doesn't know what she does to people and he's right. Just like the boy with the bread, we are in love with Kat and feel for Peeta. Book One chronicles televised weeks in the arena that will bring Kat and Peeta face-to-face with their true selves. What will they be willing to do to stay alive?  Recommended for school libraries. Readers who like UGLIES by Scott Westerfield or THE GIVER by Lois Lowry will like enjoy this.
WOW.  I purposely avoided The Hunger Games for a while because I was admittedly a little afraid of all the hype surrounding it. Before picking up The Hunger Games, I had only read one other YA book since the Twilight series (Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater, which was okay but didn't particularly rock my world or anything). Suffice it to say, I was wary of YA lit after Twilight not because I actually hated Twilight but because I can't stand Bella. Bella is such a weak character, and her relationship with Edward is so borderline abusive that it drove me absolutely nuts. I finally caved and read The Hunger Games out of a desire to read something faster-paced and at an easier level than some of my recent reads, and I'm so glad I finally did. Katniss Everdeen is definitely no Bella Swan.  The Hunger Games grabbed me from the first few pages, and didn't let go until I finished Mockingjay (the third book in the series) three days later. It is the story of a dystopian future in which North America lies in ruins and has been replaced by the nation of Panem, with the Capitol (as in the capitol city) ruling over 12 districts. There was once a 13th district, but a rebellion led to its being annihilated, and in order to keep the memory of what happens to rebels alive, the Capitol holds the annual Hunger Games. Though there's a little more to it, essentially the Hunger Games is a battle to the death on live TV between 24 kids -- one boy and one girl from each of the remaining districts. Katniss, the main character, is one of the competitors from District 12 and the book follows her through her struggles to stay alive and beat the Games.  One of my favorite genres is dystopian fiction, and The Hunger Games absolutely lived up to my hopes for it. The emotions that ran throughout the story were raw and powerful, and I found myself on the verge of tears along with Katniss at a few especially heartbreaking moments and cheering her on the whole time. Katniss is also one of my favorite heroines, living up to her characterization as a survivor in every way. Suzanne Collins did a great job of developing the characters as well as could be done in a book where people are being killed right and left. I felt like I was able to learn enough about the main characters to be sympathetic to them, and yet enough was left in the air that I was still able to be surprised at the twists and turns of the story.  I simply could not put the book down and when I was done, I couldn't wait to read the next one. The pace of the book kept me on the edge of my seat at all times and the straightforward, no-frills writing was perfect for the story. Ultimately, The Hunger Games is not just the story of Katniss, Peeta, and the others -- it is an amazing psychological novel about both the cruelty of power and finding the strength to overcome it.
Judging by the 1k+ reviews here and the 25-person wait list for the trilogy books at my library, I don't need to recap the plot for you yet again. Onward.  The story is told in a tense, clean style. Katniss' internal life is clear and vivid and so is the reasoning behind the careful, calculated decisions she must make. (I was refreshed by a strong female protagonist *not* swooningly in love with a boy for once). Realizing that intelligent readers don't need to be spoonfed their reaction to a good book, Collins lets the horror of the setting speak for itself without trying any ill-advised overdescription or editorializing. (People criticizing the lack of in-book condemnation of the Games: you feel that feeling in your gut or your chest when you think about it? That queasy, upset, repulsed feeling? *That's* your condemnation right there.)  The open-ended conclusion is well done, and a lot better than wrapping it all up neatly in a bow, which would have effectively severed the connection we've felt all along by tossing all that hard-achieved believability right out the window. Remember this is part of a trilogy, not a story meant to stand completely alone.  I particularly found the depiction of the stylists, interviewers and media circus chilling -- how many times have we watched media craft a compelling and voyeuristic "angle" around some competitor in a less-lethal sport? Seen an Olympic athlete emerge as a crowd favorite because of that hook? Witnessed people getting caught up in the artificially created character of someone on a "reality" show? And how many times have we seen that people intimately involved with brutality can distance themselves from the reality of it, interact intimately with the people affected by that brutality and ultimately send them off to be chewed up and spat out by it?  None of what Collins writes about is new, from the Roman gladiators to the deprivations of Auschwitz to the totalitarian oppression of East Germany. She syncretizes it into something completely believable -- and the understatedness of characters' reactions to it, their occupation with practical concerns, is part of that believability.  Yes, this is a violent (in concept; not so much in explicit gore) and upsetting story. Yes, you need to be aware of your kids' emotional maturity before you hand it to them and you should TALK ABOUT THE STORY WITH THEM. No, you should not read it if you suffer from PTSD or nightmares. Honor your own boundaries by all means, but I think people who pan this book for being disturbing are completely in the wrong; it's supposed to be disturbing. If we're not disturbed, we're inhuman, just like the Capitol consumers of the Hunger Games. Katniss is caught in a situation with an utter sick wrongness that can't even be adequately expressed, but she's *caught* in it, and she has to make choices based on that. That is what makes the story compelling and worthwhile.
I started out reading this because my 12 year old daughter told me that they had read this book in school and I wanted to see what she was being exposed to. I had heard some things about this book being violent and I knew that it was being made into a movie so it was a relatively popular book and I had so I decided to see for myself what the book was about.  Turns out that the story itself is somewhat violent in the sense that many teenagers are sent to the "arena" and most die, though many end up dying "off screen". The some deaths that are described are fairly tame and don't get graphic or too descriptive, though one death is fairly emotional when it happens which might be challenging for some younger, more sensitive readers. I wouldn't recommend the book to much younger than a 12 year old, unless your child is pretty mature and isn't going to be overly sensitive to characters they may have grown attached to dying.  As for the book itself, I ended up getting hooked and reading through the whole thing in a couple days. I found it to be a fun, enjoyable read with characters that were pretty believable. This book is intended for young adults much in the same way that the first two Harry Potter books were. I was able to the books for what they were and accepted them for what they set out to be.  While I did enjoy the book, I also thought there were some missed opportunities as well. I thought the book ended a bit clumsily and left some golden opportunities unexplored, I thought many of the characters were not very well fleshed out and came across as 1 dimensional including Katniss's family.  All in all I'd recommend it to just about anyone as an easy but interesting read that sets up the next two books in the trilogy nicely.
****1/2  The concept of youthful contestants pitted against another in a fight to the death in some futuristic, dystopian game show has been done before in fiction, but I don't think it's been done in a young adult novel -- at least, not as well. The Hunger Games is set in a declined, post-United States world where a decadent capitol region exerts its authority over poorer subject states by demanding teenage "tributes" to be sacrificed in its reality TV-esque Hunger Games. However, Collins doesn't focus on how or why we got there. Instead, what gives the book its chilling power is its immediacy and the way its characters seem conditioned to accept the Games as an inescapable reality: the murderous eagerness of the serious competitors, the nonchalance of the capitol residents who grow mushy at players' costumes, but place no value on their lives, or the resignation of the tributes who have little apparent chance of surviving.  Collins keeps the focus tightly on her narrator, Katniss, whose vulnerability, pragmatism, and kindness make her an appealing heroine, but who shows just enough ruthlessness that we're not sure how far she'll succumb to the cynical manipulations of the game makers. Once she's thrown into the arena, the rules, landscape, and cruel tricks of the game offer plenty of twists to keep the suspense level high -- after all, only one player can come out alive. Collins makes the violence shock the old-fashioned way -- not through gore, but by lulling the reader with a calm, familiar scene, and then dropping in a terrible one. There aren't many encounters in the Hunger Games that can be called a fair fight. In this way, Collins makes it hard for readers from Generation X-box not to look beyond the fantasy and draw psychological parallels to today's world. To what depths would we let ourselves sink to be entertained? How far are we willing to go along with the cruel mandate of an unjust authority? A typical 12 or 13 year old won't have to look too far into his or her own experience to know that the possibilities Collins is implying aren't comforting ones.  The novel has a few flaws, such as some cliched moments and characters, a cultural backdrop that could use a little more context, and the fact that its narrator, a coal miner's daugher from a poor, oppressed state where people regularly starve to death, inexplicably speaks like a prep student -- but these aren't major complaints. A gripping read for both young and older adults, and a reminder that there are still authors writing effective, readable literature-with-a-message.
The Hunger Games  by Suzanne Collins  Story Title: 3/5  Plot: 4/5  Characters: 4/5  Ending: 4/5  Synopsis:  Every year at the reaping, two children from each district, one boy, one girl, are chosen to play in The Hunger Games. Forced to battle to the death, only one victor can remain... which is a real problem for Katniss since she owes her fellow District 12 pick, Peeta, an impossible debt.  Character Likability:  Katniss: First off, love her name! Ok, much like Clary in The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare, Katniss is another girl surrounded by hot guys who seem to love her... and yet, she just doesn't have time for them. I LOVE THIS. Often repulsed at the idea of even having children (because then they'd be forced to play in The Hunger Games too), Katniss often rebukes any claim of love as something she doesn't have time for, and doesn't understand. She's not a cold character though, she's just not a Mary Sue. She, of course, has worthwhile talents, but when it comes to jumping on board the "What's going on" train, Katniss is often the last to figure it out. She figures out her own things in her own time, but she's usually last in figuring out the more complicated stuff... which, for a girl who's only ever had to worry about keeping herself and her family alive, makes perfect sense.  Peeta: A lovely, wonderful baker's son, Peeta is stuck in the middle of his own love story... unfortunately, due to the circumstances, the leading lady isn't falling for it. Doesn't matter though, Peeta knows what he wants and will do anything to protect that.  Haymitch:A former District 12 Hunger Games winner, Haymitch is a perpetual drunk... and Katniss and Peeta's mentor. As soon as he realizes he has a pair of kids who might make it, he puts in a smooth, calculating effort to keep them alive, and even though he's repulsive and spends a good portion of the novel in a puddle of  Cinna: Katniss and Peeta's stylist for the game, he's cool, collected and not nearly as flamboyant as most of the Capitol. He's a major source of support for Katniss, and one of my favorite characters.  Prim and her Mother: Prim is Katniss' little sister and the reason Katniss ended up in the games... and the reason she fights so hard. Katniss' mother was worthless after her husband's death, but brought back by Katniss' strength.  President Snow: Supreme overlord! He's the big baddy in the Capitol, and the one calling all the shots when it comes to quelling rebel uprisings and dictating how things should be run in the districts.  Rue: A small, bird-like child from District 11 that reminds Katniss of Prim.  Quality of Writing:  I found these books easy to read and quick as well. I've heard people complain that there were misplaced commas, but honestly, I remember at one point specifically noting how well placed the commas were.  Ending:  Cliffhanger of doooooom. If you liked the first book, you'll be so thankful you're reading the series now that it's all out... because honestly, if I had to wait... I might go insane.  Plot:  Katniss is living in an evil society where every year 24 children are forced to play The Hunger Games until only one is left living.  Truthfully, the plot of the first book seems to have taken heavy notes from a little Japanese thriller called Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. They are the same exact premise... as punishment for bad behavior, and to keep the peasants in-line, the ruling government forces kids to play in a game where they must battle to the death... leaving one victor who then becomes a national hero... and in both books, the main character, of course, is looking desperately for a way out of it, and a way to save someone they love at the same time. The plots really are eerily similar... and while I prefer Koushun Takami's method of announcing the dead in chapter titles, I prefer Collins' extension of this story, where there is the promise of further battle against the powers that be.  Now, I've read quite a few reviews where people have found this plot unbelievable... but, you know what, this doesn't bother me. It's not a book about how the people allowed such a game to begin, it's a book where the game already exists. I found everything that happened within the context of the game to be entirely believable.  And just so no one is confused, this IS a book about children killing children... in the most basic of terms. Beyond that, it's a very interesting, deep, questioning series that makes you really sit back and wonder about the level of betrayal and manipulation and calculation that must be going on around us all the time. It's a book that makes you question and then keeps you questioning.  Believability of World:  I find this world believable. There have been many terrible things that have happened through history... instances where people where sheparded to death, knew it, and did nothing. It's not unbelievable that Katniss' world could exist.  Overall Grade: A
Let me start off saying that I am a 38 year old mom that picked up this book only because my 12 year old son recommended it.  Imagine my surprise when I couldn't put it down!!  I loved this book even though I was unsure if I would like the plot.  I usually prefer the adult mystery/romance books.  Through this book I have discovered I like sci-fi genre now.  Never saw that coming!  Without giving anything away I will share the plot with you.  It all starts with a girl, Katniss, and her friend Gale.  Katniss lives in a place that use to be called North America before it were destroyed by people in great wars and natural disaster.  Now it has been taken over by the capitol who has established "12 districts" instead of colonies or towns.  To keep control of these districts the Capitol host every year the Hunger Games.  These Huger Games pick (supposedly from random selection) a boy and a girl between the ages of 12-18 from each district to participate.  So the bad news for these participants???  It is a fight to the death, so only one victor will remain at the end of the games.  Obviously  Katniss is picked or there wouldn't be a story.  In the book Katniss is a character you really come to love.  At times you want to reach in and strangle her yourself and other you feel deep sympathy for her plight.  It was such a good book that I ordered the rest of the series before I finished the first so I could keep on reading.  I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11.  I say 11 not because of the text used but the subject matter.  In the book it does talk about Katniss having to use "romance" with kisses to acquire some things.  It never gets into it like the adult books, but enough that if your child isn't mature enough to deal with it or you haven't had any "The Talks" yet, it might raise some questions you don't want to answer.  While there isn't a lot of detail in romance it still leaves a lot for the imagination (okay so maybe I just have a dirty mind. LOL!).  Over all great book!!!
The United States is gone. North America has become Panem, a TV-dominated dictatorship, run by a city called the Capitol. The yearly highlight is the Hunger Games: a bloodthirsty reality TV show in which 24 teenagers chosen at random--two from each District--fight each other in a desolate environment called the ''arena.'' The story follows Katniss Everdeen, a girl from District 12 and Peeta Mellark, a guy also from District 12. who begin on an adventure they will never forget, The Hunger Games.  "Winning means fame and fortune. Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun..."  Author Suzanne Collins keeps the romance moving and interesting throughout the novel involving Katness and two gentlemen. At times it's twisted, changing and confusing, but Collins keeps you involved and torn between which guy Katniss should choose and wondering if her feelings are true. At the end of the novel I was left heartbroken by a big reveal that I had been on edge about for a majority of the story. Collins then, without resolving the issue, ends the book! Oh, how cruel but suspenseful! I suggest having the next book ready and waiting.  Even though Collins is an amazing writer, she, like all authors, has her faults. Although the story line is intriguing and she keeps you emotionally involved, she tends to drag portions of the story on for longer than necessary and you start to think, "okay okay already: what's gonna happen next!"  I loved this novel! It's one of those that takes a long time in the beginning to get into only because Collins is being sneaky and getting the reader attached to each and every character. Then, wham, here is this story that  you've lost yourself in and if you're not careful you'll forget it's just a book!  Such a suspenseful, thrilling, and emotionally capturing book. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to all ages.
How is it that I have just started reading this book? I picked it up a while ago, but kept putting it off. It was such a great read that I think I will buy the boxed set and figure out what to do with my copy of The Hunger Games.  The thing that really got me was seeing the difference in the living conditions between the rich and the poor. Also, the fact they the country was split up into industries and each section pretty much did only one thing - and all for the good of the Capital. How frustrating it must have been for the kids to see everything they will never have just before going in to fight for their lives. The idea of holding an annual battle between children/teens for all to see is disturbing - it's like having a more fierce and deadly version of Survivor involving kids. This dystopian novel really makes you think about how the powerful could crush everything you hold dear and force everyone to bend at their will just to survive.  Katniss is absolutely my favourite heroine this year! Even before being chosen for the Hunger Games she was showing such strength and bravery by hunting for food for her family even though it is banned. She is so strong willed and just so real. Her emotions are all over the place during this book and I think that shows she is really just a girl thrown into a terrible world while trying to make the best of her situation. The idea of The Hunger Games makes you actually feel for her even more. Who puts children into such a place to fight to the death? You get attached to Katniss right away because it's unbearable to think of her dying.  Peeta is probably my most favourite hopeless romantic ever. No matter the situation he continues to love Katniss with his whole being, even when she is completely oblivious to it. He would do anything for her and for them to be both tossed into the Games is probably the worst situation ever - to have to knowingly kill your love interest because it means winning and be able to go home. They were the star crossed lovers like Romeo and Juliet, but with the major twist of imminent death hanging over their heads.  My two favourite parts in the book that show Katniss' more feminine side are when she sings to little Rue out in the Games - she is so tender and caring with her. And the other is her realization that she is stuck emotionally in a love triangle that she never saw coming - her best friend Gale and the baker's son and fellow competitor Peeta.  I absolutely cannot wait to read Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I must pick up the boxed set after Christmas and get reading! So with that thought in mind... I think I am going to have a giveaway for my paperback copy of The Hunger Games! Keep your eyes peeled for the contest - it should be up in a day or two.
I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend, and it seems trite to say it was a PAGE TURNER, but it absolutely was to the point of being hypnotic! I would start reading it around 10:30 at night with the intention of reading for 30 minutes or so, and I'd blink, and it would be 2 in the morning! Yes, I was that ENGAGED!  THE HUNGER GAMES is flawlessly written, has well-developed, fascinating characters, and it's fast-paced, incredibly suspenseful, and I can't RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH!!  Katniss, the main character, is the kind of hero that everyone can admire. She's incredibly smart. She's a brave and fierce warrior. She's kind to her fellow contenders/rivals as they compete to be the last kid standing. She's the JOAN OF ARC of the 21st Century! And the triangle romance between her, Peeta and Gale weaves another layer of tension and makes the book all the more appealing as we all wonder - who will Katniss choose in the end?  The world that Collins has created is unthinkably harsh/brutal, and some might say unrealistic. In that, we Americans would NEVER allow a child to be forced to participate in a fight to the death as is described in THE HUNGER GAMES. However, to me, the plot line provides an interesting parallel. Do we not all toss our young to the societal, corporate and economic wolves upon graduation from high school or college? While, of course, Katniss's life LITERALLY hangs in the balance throughout the tome, but are we not all trying to prepare our children for a perilous journey where the ugly and formidable foe of death awaits us on a bleak and distant horizon? When you think about it, the wheels of commerce could care less about the college graduate who can't find a job (and who could end up homeless) or a weak child who is ill-prepared for the cruel world like Katniss's sister akin to a high school grad trying to find employment/survive who has few job skills. So, are we really that different?  Okay, soapbox aside, lastly, THE HUNGER GAMES is an outstanding MUST READ. And I'd like to THANK Scholastic books for having the testicular strength (he he) to publish this novel. In the current bottom-line driven publishing arena where the drab prose of the mediocre is often KING (no reference AT ALL to S King) for fear that a book might be too cerebral for today's readers, which SADLY reinforces the practice of producing the bland diet of the massively over-published J Patterson and his ilk, my hat is OFF TO THE EDITORS of Scholastic for providing a truly masterful work of fiction!!! Additionally, the second book is just as awesome... can't wait to read the THIRD!  Peace out from the Buckeye state...  L Logan
The Hunger Games  By Suzanne Collins    It all started with a question: "Are you reading the Hunger Games?"  I said No.    "Really? I thought you would be reading them. Everyone else I know is reading these books."    After that, I saw several people reading the Hunger Games. That roused my curiosity. I went to Barnes and Noble and asked about this series. The fellow at the store told me the plot of the story. He also said he hardly ever read YA books, but I would love reading this series.    I found the book to be priced less on Amazon. I bought the book and began the journey into the world of Katniss and Peeta.    The country as we know it has changed. North America is now called Panem, and is divided into 12 Districts. Each District is responsible for providing one product for the Capital. District 12, where Katniss lives, is responsible for coal. The Capital controls the District's people by keeping them hungry and poor. Katniss Everdeen has been defying the Capital by sneaking out and hunting for food which she even trades with the Peacekeepers.    Every year the Capital has a festivity they call the `Reaping'. During this time one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 and 18, from each district is chosen by lottery to participate in the Hunger Games. They will be sent to fight the other 23 tributes in an areana set up by the Capital.    When twelve year old Prim Everdeen is chosen to represent District 12, her sister Katniss volunteers to take her place. The male tribute from the same district is the son of a baker. How can Katniss fight to the death with all the stronger and well trained tributes from the other districts?    The reader feels the tension building when Katniss puts things into perspective. How can she hate anyone enough to kill them, and how can she kill them when they are just children? But the hardest question is: How can she kill Peeta, who was there years ago to give her bread when she was starving?    The rules state that there can only be one victor and in order to be the victor, she will have to be the last one alive in the Hunger Games.    I just have one question: Are you reading the Hunger Games? I recommend this book and know you won't be able to eat, sleep, go to school or work until you finish this book.

I picked up this book because this summer I saw the third book in every bookstore, so I was like, why not? I'm not really a reader of YA, but I have to say I absolutely love this. Cannot put it down the moment I picked it up. Collins had that magic where she pulled in the reader from the very first moment. The first person present tense gives the story an immediacy that quickly catches a reader's attention. When I finished the first chapter, I know I was a goner.  The story is set in a post-apocalyptic world where the country in North America is called Panem. There is the Capitol and then the 12 districts serving the Capitol. Because of a rebellion decades ago, the Capitol designed the Hunger Games as punishment to the districts and as a reminder that the Capitol has the power to destroy the districts should they ever try to rebel again. The Hunger Games is basically that the Capital picks 24 kids (a girl and a boy from each district) to participate in a game where they kill off each other in an arena and only 1 can live in the end.  Katniss Everdeen is a 16 year old girl living in District 12. When her younger sister was chosen to be in the Hunger Games, she volunteered. Thus begins her journey to the Capitol and all that ensues. Because of the rather dark nature of the story, it's sometimes hard to remember that Katniss is only 16. Like other girls, she can be selfish, throws tantrums, and just be an all-around teenager, but at the same time she's remarkably old for her age, has seen a lot of dreadful things in her life, and had the strength to survive all the obstacles life had thrown at her. Sometimes one can't help but admire Katniss, but like I said, she isn't likable all the time, so in this Collins has truly created a believable and real character with conflicting emotions.  For the length of the book, there're a lot of other characters, but while the characterization of some might be a bit lacking, one truly start to care for them through the eyes of Katniss. Even her competitors are not completely despicable. This only pulls at one's heartstrings even more because we know that they have to die, yet we can't help but wanting more than one of them to win the Hunger Games  Truly enjoyed this. Reading the next book now.
`The Hunger Games' is the first book in Suzanne Collins ridiculously popular (and heartbreakingly wonderful) `Hunger Games' trilogy.  The first book came out in October 2008 and generated a *lot* of buzz. It helped that Stephenie Meyer and Stephen King provided puffs for the book's cover, and generally ensured that two very different but far-reaching audiences would give the book a go. . . but more than that, film buzz started up pretty much from the get-go. I was aware of the hype, but I also knew that `The Hunger Games' was the first book in a trilogy. . . so I decided to bide my time and wait for all the books to come out and read them back-to-back. The third and final book, `Mockingjay' was released in August of this year. . . but I still waited three months before I started reading.  There is a New World Order where the Capitol rules, absolutely. In a bid to quench uprisings and rebellion, the Capitol have made sport out of sacrifice. . . every year they hold The Hunger Games. Twenty-four people from each District (starting at age 12) are randomly selected to enter into a fight to the death - for the amusement and entertainment of Capitol residents. The Games are viewed around the world, camera lapping up the blood and gore and audiences rooting and sponsoring their favourite sacrifices.  Two children from each district, one boy and one girl, enter into the ever-changing arena landscape to battle against one another and come out the sole, victorious, survivor. The reaping provides dual purpose - entertainment value and to remind the District's that the Capitol can offer their children up to slaughter without batting an eyelid.  This year Katniss Everdeen is one of the Game's offerings. Along with Peeta Mellark, these two represent District 12 - Panem's lowliest, poorest district famous only for coal mining. Katniss enters into the game with the dwindling hope that she will survive and return home to her mother and little sister, Prim. But a risky strategy by Peeta might just turn the game around for them. . . if they spin a tale of being star-crossed lovers, thrown into the Hunger Games only to kill one another, can they win the heart of the crowd and accomplish the impossible? Can they actually win?  `The Hunger Games' is summer-blockbuster reading. It's a cross between George Orwell's 1984, Gladiator, Mad Max and John Marsden's `Tomorrow' series. . . in a word: `phenomenal'. I hate to use clichs, but `The Hunger Games' is literally `unputdownable'. It's the sort of book that you hole yourself up with in your room, and when someone comes in to tell you that dinner is ready or it's time for you to go to work, you snarl and snap at them and tell them to get the hell out because you just got to a really good part and they're killing your reading-mojo. . . it's that kind of book!  There are so many layers to `The Hunger Games'. On the surface it's a damn good yarn - full of tension, action, unrequited love and moral conundrums. . . but if you dig deeper you start to really appreciate how complex Suzanne Collins's universe is.  The book acts as a sort of mirror to society. In a time when reality TV rules the box, Collins writes a distorted, dystopian imagining of reality TV in the future - where blood-sport is the new norm. The same way that George Orwell predicted a watchful Big Brother society, Collins forecasts a disturbing new trend in reality television. And a lot of the book's focus (even indirectly) is on the audience who lap up the bloodied television show.  I loved reading about the Capitol and its residents. It is with characters like Effie Trinket (one of District 12's `mentors') that Collins takes current notions of `celebrity' to exaggerated and disturbing lengths. I loved reading about the look and dress of Capitol residents - from the stylist who dyed her skin a pea-green shade to the gold eye-tattoos and rampant plastic surgery. There's no doubt that Collin's fictional future dystopia is our current society in a fun-house mirror - embellished and ruined.  `The Hunger Games' is a twisted, romantic fare. Peeta and Katniss's `romance' is wonderful and wonderfully complicated. The book is told from Katniss's perspective, so when Peeta starts flirting she (and readers) are never entirely sure if it's a strategy or genuine love. Add into the mix the fact that Peeta and Katniss are going into the Hunger Games arena knowing only one of them can survive. . . and this isn't your typical romance. I've never read such high romantic stakes in a Young Adult book and I loved the fact that the `love story' is just as edge-of-your-seat as the action of fighting to the death. Brilliant!  Perhaps my favourite aspect of `The Hunger Games' was the characters and Suzanne Collin's making heroes out of her young protagonists. I love reading YA books where the author doesn't `talk down' to her characters, and therefore audience. Collins has really made a hero of Katniss - she has written her as a tough-as-nails, ass-kicking young woman. And I especially loved that all of the young characters in this book don't rely on adults to `save' them - they have to save themselves because, in fact, the adults are the bad guys. The adults are the Gamemakers and Capitol politicians who insist on throwing these games every year and making a killing example out of these poor kids.  Like John Marsden, Suzanne Collins throws her young characters into impossibly awful situations, letting them save themselves and test their own mettle. Brilliant. These are characters that young readers can admire and learn from.  I absolutely, unabashedly and whole-heartedly loved the first book in the Hunger Games trilogy. On the one hand I kind of wish I had jumped on the Suzanne Collins band-wagon sooner. . . but at the same time I was totally relieved reading the last page of `The Hunger Games' and knowing that `Catching Fire' and `Mockingjay' were waiting for me on my shelf. I don't know how I could have stood the suspense otherwise.
What is it about Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins that enthralls me so much? My husband teases that it's all the fighting and the killing. He is right that the book is driven by violence. It is also driven by suspense. Which means in either case, it's not my typical book. I prefer character books; where there is more than action to the story. Hunger Games however is that special hybrid that offers mind-bending and heart-wracking thrills, while also offering up characters to love, settings to absorb, and enough emotional angst and moral probing to leave one slightly unsettled when the book covers are shut.  Collins reveals much of the depth of her main character Katniss through the memories she relives of family, friends, and neighbors while competing for her life against eleven other selected tributes in the Capitol's arena of death. Even before being plunged into this nightmare, however, we first see Katniss seek the warm comfort of her sister, anticipate the comfortable presence of best friend Gale, swing by the Hob (a black market) which remains busy even on Reaping Day, and struggling to accept help from her mother. In other words, in just one chapter, Collins successfully presents Katniss as a vulnerable and flawed but likeable character. Then in the very next, her sister's name is called as a tribute, Katniss volunteers to take her place, and the countdown to the Hunger Games begins. Yet Collins continues to delve deeply into her characters, like a miner burrowing deeper and deeper into the earth, even as the action switches from District 12 to the Capitol and to the Hunger Games arena.  While I also do not particularly gravitate to books about other worlds, setting can enhance a book for me in the same way that large screens and high definition video can enhance the movie-viewing experience. Collins has delineated details so well that her hauntingly medieval but also starkly futuristic setting feels alarmingly real. Each district in her country of Panem lives by a trade, in District 12 children grow up to be coal miners, and suffers from the effects of war. All districts are separated from one another, surrounded by electric fences, and often guarded by Peacekeepers who punish law-breakers with whippings, gallows, or gunfire. Even worse, the Capitol annually requires each district to enter names of children into a drawing, from which one youth per district is picked to compete in the Hunger Games, from which there is allowed to only a single survivor. In ancient times maidens were sacrificed to appease monsters or gods; in Panem, children are thrown into an arena where environmental features such as manufactured wild birds and beasts are dreamt up by the Gamekeepers of the Capitol.  I could rave further about all the positives of Hunger Games. There is Collins' style: "As I stride to the elevator, I fling my bow to one side and quiver to the other ... brush past the Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve...." Teachers would definitely praise Collins for her use of WOW words! There is also the thematic undertone: Consider Peeta's declaration that in the arena: "I want to die as myself." His stirring words causes a quarrel between him and Katniss that reminds of the varied reactions of contestants on reality shows. Truly Hunger Games holds so many qualities so perfectly blended together that it needs to be your next read.
Are you hungry for a new book? If so go to your nearest book store and buy yourself a tasty Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. This sifi and action book is full of action and suspense. This 347 page book is for people 10 and up. You will probably stay up all night with a flashlight reading this book!

My favorite parts of the book are; when katniss gets her bow and arrow because it causes most of the action most of the action and lets her kill people and hunt for food. Another great part is when katniss meets rue because she has twice as many people to kill and she has to protect and then kill Rue. This book is to die for!

So go to your nearest bookstore and buy you self a copy of the hunger games!!!  *****
CONTAINS SPOILERS  this is one of my favorite books. it is well written and descriptive in my opinion. it never gets boring. i am so obsessed with this book that i could asnwer any question about it.    in my opinion the minor characters play a huge part in the book. if one were to think about any of the many many many minor characters roles they would realize if one of them didnt exist then it would throw the rest of the story off. here are only very few examples of this.  if Glimmer did not exist then Katniss would have never got the bow and arrows when the Careers chased her up a tree where she dropped a tracker jacker nest on them killing Glimmer. if Marvel (boy from District 1) didnt exsist Rue wouldnt have died how she did. if Cato didnt exist then katniss and peeta couldve won easier. but then who would the mutts have attacked? if Clove wasnt there who would Thresh have killed at the feast? Katniss? then whats the point of the book if the main character dies in the middle of the story? then theres Foxface. if she didnt exist then Katniss wouldve never known about the mines around the Careers supplies. once again Katniss would have died. Rue. my favorte character. Katniss wouldnt have known how to treat tracker jacker stings and she wouldnt know how to use the night vision glasses. If Thresh didnt exsist Katniss would be dead. simply because Thresh saved her from Clove at the feast. Prim... if she didnt exsit Katniss wouldnt have gone to the Hunger Games in the first place. no story there. if Gale didnt exist Katniss wouldnt have known how to set up the snares that she did. Finally, Cinna created what Katniss and Peeta wore when they rode in the chariots throught the capitol. because of their costumes Katniss became known as the girl on fire.  the point of that long paragraph was to say that Suzanne Collins made all of the minor characters play a very important role in some part of the book.  the one thing i dont like about this book is Peeta. its hard to explain without ruining the last book but i absolutely despise him. in my opinion he just made it harder on Katniss in the arena. i also think that Gale shouldve voulenteered to take Peetas place.  once again this is my favorite book and i cannot wait until the movie comes out! when i wrote this i found that it is supposed to come out in 2013.
I know a book is good when I put off all other responsibilities, including sleep, in order to finish it. And even though this is classified as a 'young adult' novel, I enjoyed it perhaps even more than other 'adult' novels I've read recently. It deals with a very mature concept without being too graphic, and at times is very thought provoking.  If you have read Koushun Takami's "Battle Royale"  then the idea behind "The Hunger Games" will be familiar. In an effort to keep their citizens in a state of constant fear and passivism, the Capitol of Panem (formerally the USA, renamed after a violent uprising of citizens against the government)has created the "Hunger Games", an annual contest to the death between 24 kids between the ages of 12 and 18. One boy and one girl are randomly picked from each of the Capitol's outlying 12 districts. When the story begins, it is reaping day, when the 'tributes', as they are called, are chosen.At age 16, Katniss Everdeen has already had to endure four reapings in District 12, and she has had the fortune of never being picked. But this is the first year her younger sister Prim has been required to enter, and wouldn't you know that she is picked and Katniss volunteers to take her place. To make matters worse, the male tribute of District 12 is a boy she owes her very life to--Peeta Mellark, the son of a baker who purposly risked a beating from his mother in order to give Katniss bread when she was on the verge of starvation several years earlier.  Just in the first few chapters Suzanne Collins has set the pace for an exciting, violent and emotional story that never loosens its grip on the reader. Katniss is caught in a whirlwind of activity where she must prepare to kill or be killed, but the complications of having Peeta involved make the situation much more difficult, as there can only be one winner of the Hunger Games.  Katniss is an easy character to like and root for, even when she is being completely oblivious to certain situations right in front of her. Her main goal is survival, and she will do whatever it takes to win. The deaths are handled very tastefully and are never too graphic. The romance is also subdued, no more than kissing, but adds just the right amount of extra suspense and problems for Katniss to deal with.  You can't read this book and not help to wonder if something like this could ever happen in the civilized world. Could one government become so powerful that the could keep an entire population controlled to point that no one thinks twice about children being sent off to kill one another? How long would people allow it to go one before rising up against the government and taking control again? By the end of "the Hunger Games" it is clear that another revolution is brewing, and Katniss is right in the middle of it. Almost as soon as I finished this book I rushed out to pick up "Catching Fire". Collins has created a mature read for anyone, though some parents might want to read it for themselves first before deciding if it is appropraite for their kids. If anything, it should encourage some family discussion about the boundaries of power and how one maintains individualism in the face of overwhelming subjection. I can't wait to see how Katniss's story ends.
The Hunger Games are the ultimate reality show: A fight to the death among 24 young people (the tributes), one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts, while the rich and spoiled people of the Capitol watch on, and bid for their favorites. Only a winner is allowed. A winner that will never be hungry again or forced to participate in the games.  The Games take place every year in the Capitol and are run by the government that rules the twelve districts, the remnants of the land that once was called North America. The Games are a reminder that "resistance is futile" as the Capitol has the power to destroy the districts if so wished, as it destroyed number thirteen seventy four years ago during the last rebellion.  As the book starts, sixteen years old Katniss volunteers to compete in the Games when her twelve years old sister is chosen to represent the 12th district. Katniss, who lost her father in a mine explosion at thirteen and has been since keeping her mother and little sister fed with her hunting, is determined to stay alive whatever the price. For Peeta, the male tribute from the same district, things are not so simple. Is it possible, he wonders, to play the Games without losing his humanity?  Those who think YA and/or Fantasy books are light fare may have to reconsider after reading this book because the question The Hunger Games asks: would you kill to stay alive? Would you kill an enemy, a friend, a lover? is not easy to answer.  Suzanne Collins's premise in The Hunger Games is that yes, when hunted, we all become hunters. But killing a human being comes with a high price and the survivor will forever be haunted by the dead.  Being a Young Adult novel, the story ends with a note of hope (and BTW that is why I read/write YA novels). Yet the question remains, taunting the reader: how much of your humanity/your core beliefs will you give up to stay alive? to make a living? It's a question we all have had (or will have) to answer sometime in our lives, even if the circumstances are not as extreme as in the novel and the price to pay for failure not as high.
My Summary: In a futuristic society, the United States is no more. In it's place is Panem, and only twelve of the original thirteen districts remain.  Katniss Everdeen, a resident of the coal-producing District Twelve, prepares for The Reaping by making sure that her little sister Prim has as few entries as possible. Yet, against the odds, Prim is picked and Katniss volunteer's in her place to be a tribute for the yearly Hunger Games.  She knows the odds aren't good. 24 tributes in all, and only one can survive. It will be a fight to the death, against people she cares about, and only the strong and smart can survive...  Review: Action-filled, surprising moments, smartly plotted and equally smart characters...can this book get any better?  The Hunger Games is one of those series that is addictive, smart, and very well plotted. She uses the skills her father taught her about hunting in order to help her family survive (which is illegal). She hunts with her best friend Gale, to keep both their families alive and well. However, once Katniss becomes a tribute, she has to focus on one thing only: survival. Staying true to her character, Katniss doesn't become some bloodthirsty beast, she gets smart, uses her wits and skills in the arena, as well as forms alliances...but only one person can survive in the end.  Each character is well developed, with their own personalities. I didn't like every character, but that's what made them all more real to me, because you can't like everyone (although, I loved Haymitch! So funny!).  The description flows perfectly, the surprises don't fail to shock, and the end gives you both fulfillment (there's nothing too cliffhangerish) and curiosity for the next installment, Catching Fire.  This trilogy is perfect for anyone who enjoys a good dystopia novel, with action, adventure, a dash of romance, and plenty of moments where you will be unable to tear yourself away from the book.  Highlights: In a game of survival, I didn't know what to expect next. I love how smart Katniss is, and she uses everything she has. The girl is smart, and focused, which is wonderful to read about. I enjoyed Collins' writing as well, it's very easy to fall into and get caught up in the story.  Lowlights: I'm not really a fan of the name "Katniss", but it's grown on me through the years. And really, it's kind of a petty thing to consider a "lowlight".
So, apparently... I'm late to the party... again. I've been told by countless friends and bloggers that I need to read THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins. My best friend raved about it. But... dystopian books really aren't my thing. I decided to pick it up anyway, and it's been sitting on my shelf for a couple years.  With the release of MOCKINGJAY and the frenzy surrounding it, I decided to start reading. As with other dystopian novels, I had a hard time getting into the book. Figuring out what their world was like and trying to get a grasp on the situation. All I can say is... I'm really glad I don't live in this world.  A boy and girl from each district are chosen every year to fight to the death in a televised event. All contestants range from ages 12 to 18. And only one can survive. Katniss volunteered to go to The Hunger Games, in the place of her little sister, Prim. And Peeta was chosen to go along as well to represent District 12. There is an interesting dynamic between these two characters. It's written from Katniss' point of view, so you don't always know what Peeta's thinking. But then, you don't always know exactly what Katniss is thinking, either.  They are given the royal treatment as they prepare for the games, and their mentor, a previous winner from District 12, is a drunk. (Although I did really enjoy Haymitch). Their team tries to prepare them. They get tossed into an arena and are expected to kill every other teen there. How can anyone be prepared for that?  So, yeah... this book definitely didn't seem like something I'd enjoy reading. But the writing was fantastic. I enjoyed many of the characters and look forward to getting to know them better, especially Gale. A few scenes made me weepy, and once made me actually cry. While I liked the book, I didn't love it as many of my friends did. But I'm definitely glad I took the time to read it, and I already pulled CATCHING FIRE from my shelf. I definitely recommend it.  I loved the names in this book, especially Katniss Everdeen.  There are three "teams" fans of this series has chosen: Team Peeta, Team Gale, and Team Katniss. I see a lot of people on Peeta's team, but I don't feel Gale was given a good enough shot. So I'm reserving my right to choose a team affiliation until later. Temporarily though, I'm Team Katniss.  Down with the Capitol!
Review Posted on [...] by Laura Lynn  [...]  I had no idea what "The Hunger Games"  by Suzanne Collins was about before picking it up two days ago. I had heard my friends ohhh and ahhh, but had no idea of the plot, the genre or even the characters. I laughed when I saw I was number 75 on the hold list at the library, but figured I would read it when my turn came. My turn came this weekend when a friend lent me her copy.  The Hunger Games is set in the future after war has eliminated the United States and left the country of Panem in its place. Each year the 12 districts within this country are required to select 2 youth to fight in a gladiator style battle to the death. Huger Games follows the struggle of the teenagers from District 12 from before they are chosen until the battle is over.  Now I have to admit this is not my usual fare. I do not read blood and guts stories, nor do I typically enjoy suspense novels, so I was a little apprehensive about the topic. If I had not been quickly drawn into the narrative I'm not sure I would have finished it. As it was, I was so quickly absorbed that I read almost all of the book in one sitting.  Aimed at the teenage market, the story is easy to read and the characters appeal to the adolescent crowd. That said, there is something universal about the struggle to survive that I could relate to, even buy into. While the main characters, Katniss and Peeta, are from different parts of society and their individual struggles differ, both must fight to the death inside the arena.  The story does not focus on killing as much as I had expected, instead it focuses on relationships and emotions. Topics such as friendship, loyalty, love, determination, hope, betrayal, fear, insecurity and survival make the story a rich backdrop to interact with the characters.  At 374 pages, I finished the story in 4-5 hours, and found myself unable to put it down toward the end. Suzanne Collins does a wonderful job of making the reader care about Katniss and I found myself worried about how the story would turn out.  While The Hunger Games may not make it into the classics with Bronte or Austen, it is a fun read that will draw you in and keep you engaged. There are two more books in the series, Catching Fire and Mocking Jay which hopefully will wrap up a few loose ends and complete the story of Katniss and Peeta. You should see those reviews in the upcoming weeks.
This is the ultimate Don't-put-down-until-you're-finished book.  From the word go, I was hooked.  It takes place in America centuries from now.  Welcome to a place where there are twelve districts, where reputation is everything, and where for entertainment people are forced to kill each other.  It sounds brutal.  It is.  Katniss Evergreen is the main character and she's not just some girl.  She lives in District Twelve.  District Twelve is poorest and most looked down on district there is.  It's not easy to live there.  There's no work, hence no way to get food.  But not for Katniss.  She's the ultimate rebel.  The district is supposed to be surrounded by an electric fence.  Lucky for her she can get in and hunt.  Katniss will do anything to care for her family since her father died.  In the end, it seems she doesn't succeed.  The Hunger Games is something of a punishment to the entire country, as well as a threat.  The capital, Panem, means to show that they have the power through the games.  From every district two are chosen, a male and female to participate in the Hunger Games.  The object: Kill everyone and be the only one to survive.  If you win, you live the life of luxury afterwards.  Some of the districts youth train for the Hunger Games their entire life.  These districts are the richest among all the others.District Twelve receives no training whatsoever.  This years female chosen: Katniss' little sister.  Katniss immediately volunteers and goes instead of her younger sister.  The male chosen from district Twelve is someone who once saved Katniss' life.  District twelve has been the joke of the games for years.  But Katniss refuses to give up.  Even before the games she defies the capital and breaks rules.  During the games she stays out of the way and lays low.  but eventually she'll have to come out.  Katniss Everdeen is a character that you can't help but adore.  She's independent, hardworking, and big hearted even if she won't admit it.  She's not a crowd favorite in the book, but that's the way she wants it.  She's one of those characters that proves one person really can make a difference.  I loved the book.  It's a novel that is surprisingly realistic.  To this book I can honestly say, I felt like I was there.  The author is truly talented and I expect to see many more great things from her.  I can only that I highly recommend this book to all.  That's the least I can say other than, if you're reading to get a feel for the book, I'm surprised you haven't yet read it.
As you probably know by now, Hunger Games is about a post-apocaliptic North America. The land is now Panem, a country divided into the capital and 12 distinct districts. Each year, to show that the leaders in the capital are all-powerful, two children (a boy and a girl aged 12-18) are chosen from each district to compete in a televised battle royale. The 24 children must fight to the death, until only one stands. That winner will bring wealth and respect back to his or her family and district. The entire event is broadcast to the city for - disgustingly - its entertainment.  Sixteen year old Katniss Evergreen is from District 12, a very poor area known for coal mining. With her father dead, she single-handedly takes care of her mother and younger sister, Prim. When Prim is chosen to be part of the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. So, she and the baker's son, Peeta, are taken to the capital and - eventually - the games, where they have to use every skill possible to literally stay alive.  The book is extremely gripping from page one. Part The Lottery, part Lord of the Flies and part Battle Royale, it brings all of the themes together into one delicious read. And it doesn't hold back. While just a young adult book, Suzanne Collins does not treat her readers like children. From the moment the games begin, character die - brutally. Shocking, terrifying, and utterly engaging, the book doesn't let you put it down.  I enjoyed the overall theme - how the government, when given the chance, can really overtake and overthrow society. I never forgot how much was at stake for Katniss, as she navigated the playing field, and it utterly terrified me. It's a great read for today's society, that's so obsessed with reality tv shows.  There's a reason the book has been linked to the Twilight series. While much better written, it's equally as grabbing. There isn't a vampire, yet there is an underlying romance brewing for Katniss. Yet, as opposed to Bella, Katniss is extremely hardcore. She's not weak, and while at times she does doubt her survival, she continues going. She's a fantastic character.  While brutal, the book was truly fantastic and I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of the sequel (and the release of the final book of the trilogy - Mockingjay). Seriously, don't doubt it. It may seem similar in theme, but it definitely brings a new spin and is incredibly haunting from page one. It shows the power of children, and, ultimately, the raw talent of the author. It keeps you thinking, as any great book should do.
Meet Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year-old female who lives with her younger sister, Prim, and their mother. Katniss has had an unfortunately difficult life but she has made the best of it. She lives in District 12, the final district of Panem. It is the Coal producing district, and she lost her father, a coal miner, in a mine disaster, years earlier. Panem arose out of what remained of North America after natural and man-made disasters destroyed it. As with many post-apocalyptic tales, rebellions occurred against the powers-that-be, otherwise known as the Capitol. During the uprisings, District 12 was defeated and District 13 was destroyed.  In order for the 12 districts to always remember who holds the power, the Capitol began an annual event called The Hunger Games. Every year, each district produces one girl and one boy (ages 12 through 18, randomly drawn) to fight in the Games. The 24 tributes are taken to the Capitol and enjoy a short week of simple training, eating like kings, and attending events and interviews. Then, they are thrown into the vast outdoor arena to fight for their lives, as the Hunger Games has only one winner.  As you can probably guess, Katniss is the tribute for District 12, along with Peeta Mellark, the town baker's son. They are whisked away to the Capitol and treated like royalty. It becomes apparent that Katniss may stand a chance in the Games when she proves to the Gamemasters that she possesses great hunting skills. After all, she has been keeping her family from starvation for years by killing game and gathering vegetation (illegally) in the Seam of District 12.  While Katniss and Peeta are from the same District, it is no secret that they will eventually face one another as enemies. Peeta is very kind, but Katniss vows not to allow him to weasel his way into her heart. Peeta surprises her though, on many levels and in many ways, throughout the book. Does he eventually weasel his way in? Can he be trusted in such a dire situation?  The characters in this novel are very realistic as they sympathize with others and form alliances and friendships even though they face overwhelming odds. All 24 tributes have some sort of page time, some way more than others. The plot is high intensity, very dramatic, deeply emotional and completely engrossing! Katniss is courageous, intelligent, skilled, wily, and compassionate. Peeta is kind, loyal, and brave, but is not on an equal playing field with Katniss' skills. Peeta grew on me. I didn't have much draw towards him through much of the book, but he won me over at the #7 quote below.  The mutations of animals that you come across in this world are interesting, freaky and vile! The Capitol bio-engineered certain species for their own purposes - spying, physical damage, etc - and they play serious roles in this story. The mutants at the end of the book completely horrified me and I wonder if we will learn more about them.  There are a few twists at certain times in the books. One is very obvious, in my opinion, but the one at the end snuck up on me! It is an ugly twist that will make you gasp, and the outcome of that event sends us flying into the second book, Catching Fire.  Conclusion: 5 WHOLE STARS! What an entertaining and simultaneously disturbing novel! While the plot has been done before (The Game, Battle Royale), it does not take away from the emotional intensity you will find yourself feeling page after page! It is nothing short of fantastic. I have yet to speak to a book blogger who did not rave about this trilogy
I have always been a sucker for books with good dystopian story lines and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins delivers on that very premise.  Set in the ruins of North America, in the country of Panem, the story details the lives in the twelve districts that surround The Capitol with. The Hunger Games focuses on the story of a sixteen-year-old girl from District Twelve,  named Katniss Everdeen, who's life consists of hunting in the woods with her friend Gale in order to keep her mother and her little sister, Prim,  alive.  However, on the day that Katniss' narration begins, survival is more important then ever. At two a celebration known as "The Reaping" occurs where a boy and a girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen will have their named picked from a bowl and made to fight for their survival in an arena where the Hunger Games will take place.  Katniss has done everything to make sure Prim is safe, but when Prim's name is drawn out of the bowl on Reaping Day, Katniss steps up to take her sister's place as a tribute.  Taken to the Capitol where she joins the other twenty-four tributes, Katniss is disgusted by the pageantry of what, in her mind, equates to an execution, and the politics that occur during her training days. Which is only made more complicated by the male tribute from her district, who may very well fancy her.  As the Hunger Games progress Katniss is faced with morality and survival in this tale of what it truly means to be human.  My first impression of this book was not a good one. I had problems imagining the world that Collins was setting up and I wasn't entirely sure that I got it straight.  The first likened the world of Panem to an old Victorian village, especially District Twelve, and then later started to imagine a world similar to Equilibrium. Finally when I managed to get the combination of technology with the poverty stricken districts, I found the book quite enjoying and was really taken by the politicking and how Collins was able to weave it into a story that featured children.  Shortly after Part II began I found myself engrossed in the novel. I didn't want to put it down with each new stratagem that was devised and each alliance that was made.  In fact, one of the biggest successes I found of Part II was making me forget the politics of Part I and involving me in each move that the tributes made.  It isn't until Part III that the political aspect of the book picks up again leaving the reader starving--I know I can't help the pun--to read the sequel Catching Fire.  The lasting impression that The Hunger Games gave me was that this is not Twilight. Certainly there's action and adventure, even a love triangle, but its not the focus of the book. What this book gives readers is the haunting desire to question the motivations of a culture and think about what they would do if such a practice was implemented.  As I approached the end of The Hunger Games, I found myself reminded of The Draft. The practices of Reaping Day reminded me so much of that practice at the very end that I couldn't help but find myself desiring to read Catching Fire immediately, particularly since Katniss' transformation is so beautifully written.  Final Grade: A-
So after putting this series off for a far too long I finally decided it was time to read The Hunger Games. Let me tell you I am kicking myself for not starting it sooner. The bright side is that the second book is already out and the third is close at hand so I won't have to wait to finish this series. If you are looking for a book with a strong female heroin, edge of your seat suspense, or an emotional rollercoaster then this is the book for you. I have not cried from reading a book in a while (mostly because I steer clear of the tear jerker genre in general) but this one had me turning on the waterworks.  Katniss Everdeen is a 16-year-old girl living with her mother and younger sister (Prim) in the poorest district of Panem, District 12. Panem is what remains of the United States. Panem was once thirteen districts and a capital, but after an uprising nearly 75 years ago only 12 districts remain. The war that the district raged on the capital all those years ago is how the Capital has justified the creation of "The Hunger Games." Each year, ever one of the remaining twelve districts must send one boy and one girl to compete in the televised event where they are forced to fight to the death. Only one will be allowed to survive.  The reaping (like a lottery) is a dreaded event by everyone in the district but it is especially troubling for Katniss because this is the first year that her little sister's name will be in the running. When Prim is chosen, Katniss steps forward to take her place. Now Katniss along with Peeta are swept away to represent District 12 in the 74th annual Hunger Games.  I am a twilight fan so in the spirit of the Twilight mania going on in the world I am totally team Peeta! I &lt;3 Gale but Peeta...swoon! ;)  [...]
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  Scholastic, Inc, 2008  374 pages  YA; Science-fiction  1st in trilogy  5/5 stars  Source: I bought this because a. it has been highly acclaimed around the blogosphere and b. it was in paperback.  Summary: In the future the country is divided in to 12 districts plus the Capitol. Every year a boy and a girl from each district is chosen to participate in the Hunger Games, where they fight and kill down to the last person standing. This year Katniss is going as a tribute from District 12 and she's rather determined to win.  WITH (minor) SPOILERS!  Thoughts: I was a little leery of this because I'm not the biggest dystopian fan and it sounded super violent. Plus it was super popular-what if it was another Twilight (Note: I am largely anti-Twilight because it is crap, crap, crap).  Now Katniss doesn't really have any female friends but she's close to her sister and fiercely protective of her family, which I love. As an older sister, I like to think that I would be able to protect my sister even if I can't shoot arrows as well as Katniss. I also loved the secondary characters, especially Cinna and Haymitch, two of the people helping Katniss during the Games. They're funny and she interacted in interesting ways with them.  There was some predictability. It was pretty obvious who would be the last to die, when Rue would die, and a bit of the love story but it didn't detract from my enjoyment.  Team: This is the big question so...Peeta! He's been in love with her for eleven years; person secretly in love with another for ages is one of my favorite romantic tropes. While Gale may be in a similar position, he didn't take the opportunity to express it. It also helps that in Forever Young Adult's handy dissections of the series, Peeta is represented by William Moseley and Gale by Ethan Peck; Um King Peter FTW! (Actually I really love their review so check that out too)  Overall: Outstanding dystopian with generous dollops of romance-highly recommended!  Predictions: Keeping in mind that I've mostly avoided spoilers for the next two books, these are some of the things I'm thinking: Katniss will lead a rebellion against the Capitol, culminating in Mockingjay; the relationship between her and Peeta and her and Gale will end in a permanent relationship of her with one of them; I am also hoping that Katniss doesn't die.
The Hunger Games is part of a three part trilogy.  It is set in the future and the USA is dissolved and been replaced by an alternate country named Panem, which has 12 districts all extremely poor compared to the capital district.  To punish the districts for trying to revolt against the capital and to show its power over the people, the capital sponsors a tournament which selects a boy and girl from each district to compete in an all out battle to the death tournament. It's a tremendous spectacle that is broadcast to the entire nation and mandatory for them to watch.  The two main characters Katniss, who the story is told through, and Peeta the boy also chosen from district 12, unfortunately find themselves thrown together in the Hunger Games. All the tributes have different skills they possess and challenges that they have to survive, all while attempting to kill off the other tributes and stay alive.  An interesting twist to the story presents a romantic tale that creates interesting sport for the Hunger Games viewers.  Katniss struggles with keeping herself alive, while at the same time trying to dissect and understand her emotions and feelings for those in the games separating reality from acting, all while remembering those faces she has left at home.  Surprisingly this story is increasingly addicting. The action is intense, the resourcefulness of the characters is a lesson on survival, and the romance drama creates a interesting twist where the tributes are suppose to be killing each other not forming alliances and falling for each other.  Being set in the future, the story and details has a sci-fi feel that is awesome. It reads fast and almost has a snow-balling effect as you close in on the end, which leaves you thirsting for the next installment.
When a YA novel comes along that has so much hype such as The Hunger Games I become hesitant to read it because I haven't had much luck with the hyped-up YA books. I think it's just because I don't mesh with the things that make those books exciting for others. I put off reading The Hunger Games until I saw it was available at the library so I requested it.  Despite my bias going into it (which I tried really hard to suppress) this book still managed to win me over. There were many things that I liked. Firstly, despite the book's premise being hard to believe, the fact that people would actually watch children kill themselves in an arena for victory, I thought Collins did the best job she could to make it plausible. There was some internal logic that I sensed which made me happy. I like when things make sense. I was able to suspend disbelief and nothing broke that.  This was done through good world-building in the form of a dystopian North America. The characters were real. I thought the portrayal of Katniss as a strong teen-aged girl was not over the top or too weak. You really knew her motivations (to take care of her sister) and you could relate to them.  Another great aspect of the story is the fast pace and Collins' ability to create tension. The Games are brutal, exciting and scary. If I was a teenager reading this I'd be freaked out and intrigued. I was even still! Actually, I think I would have loved this book at that age.  There are some areas I thought could be improved on. I would have liked to see more of the outside world. We are limited in what we see due to the first person view of Katniss. I would have liked to see more of the people of the world and what their experiences are like because I believe Collins created something interesting. However, this is a little criticism and in general I still thought the book was great.  I recommend this to teens who don't mind some violence and anyone interested in good quality YA fiction. I will be reading the sequel soon.
The Hunger Games  By: Suzanne Collins  A modern gladiator and a survival reality TV show all wrapped up in one thrilling book.  Taking place in Panem, a future country where the United States is presently located, 12 districts struggle for survival following a recent disaster.  Included in this disaster was an uprising of the formally 13 districts against the capitol.  The capitol defeated the 13th district and repressed the other 12 districts. As a reminder to the districts of who is in charge, the capitol hosts the annual "hunger games," which all citizens of the country are required to watch.  The games consists of the capitol picking one boy and one girl from each district to fight to the death.  In the book, Katniss, the main character, is forced to take care of her mother and younger sister following her father's death.  This included hunting and gathering food from the forest, where she mastered the bow and arrow, knives, and other survival skills.  As her sisters name is called for the hunger games, Katniss steps forward to take her place to battle against 23 other contestants from the country.  The key to winning isn't just in strength and size; you must also know how to survive in the wilderness, and play the game right to win sponsors from around the country that can assist you by airdropping supplies. The book demonstrates perfectly how Katniss plots, plays, overcomes trials, and defeats all her opponents.  I am not a very big reader, but once I started this book, I could not put it down.  I even dreamed about being in the book for weeks after I had finished it.  Suzanne Collins captures your attention from the first page, and you never lose interest throughout the book.  There is a perfect amount of violence, comedy, and even intimacy to keep the story interesting. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars.
1. Writing Style/Readability: The writing style is really simple, but this IS a book directed towards younger kids after all. Plus, it's a better style for an action novel as it doesn't belabor the point for 20 pages by describing every bead of sweat and sound in the forest. As for "readability" I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.  2. Plot: this is one of the things that made The Hunger Games really hit home for me. It was fast paced and action-packed and also "wonderfully predictable" in that when you really want something to happen, it does.  3. Characters: All of them were pretty plain with not much going on underneath the surface, but not in a way that was annoying or unenjoyable. The heroine is full of nothing but, of course, moral fiber, her only "flaw" being that she has a fiery temper which is played to be endearing. She's also very humble of her abilities and totally oblivious to Peeta and Gale's affections for her (yet oh so observant on the battlefield) which is usually extremely annoying, but the other aspects of the novel made up for it.  4. Overall Originality:  It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that nothing like this has been done before (and I don't mean in a broad sense about totalitarian government, blah blah). The author added a few futuristic elements to the story with the genetically engineered animals and all that, but not such an alarming amount that would distance the reader from the story.  5. Value (was it thought provoking?): Didn't really produce any life changing epiphanies.  6. Enjoyment: I loved this book and that is the reason I give it 5 stars. I value books more for how much I enjoyed them personally rather than for how well written or how thought provoking they were, although those are certainly key factors. Ultimately, though, it comes down to if I would want to read this book again or recommend it to friends, and in that aspect, this book is 100% in that category.  Also...PG-13  Violence in the book isn't graphic in description, but is in concept (teenagers killing each other without empathy and all that, but most video games are no better), but there's no mention of sex (as you'd think there'd be in such a brutal society). I'm glad there isn't, though because this is a book directed towards young teens and senseless sex is obnoxious in any book.  The Bottom Line: You'll be missing out if you don't read this book! =]
The Hunger Games is a book that seized me by the throat and didn't even let me go, even when I read the last word on the page.  It is the kind of book that I had to force myself to put down so that I could go to sleep, and that I immediately picked up again upon waking.  It is the kind of book that demanded that I sit down and read and read and read until I finally discovered what had become of the characters.  It is vividly and masterfully written, the kind of book that is guaranteed to stick with me for quite some time, the kind of book I am sure to read again and again.  Though I had been aware of the book's popularity before I read it, I didn't really know anything about the premise--and I'm actually glad that I didn't.  The brutality of it shocked me in a very visceral way.  I was horrified by its depiction of such a grim future, and by the very thought of a society that would pit children against one another in a fight to the death.  Needless to say, this is a very intense book and one that is very violent as well.  I don't think that it's a reason to prevent a mature child from reading it, but I do think it's a reason for a parent to read it as well.  This is a book that needs to be discussed, whose themes need to be explored.  Yes, The Hunger Games is a work of fiction, but it does contain many elements of truth that are relevant to our world today.  The brutal regime that controls Panem is not that different from the brutal regimes that control many parts of the globe even as I type these words.  I think it is only natural to want to shelter our children from this kind of violence, but I feel the book provides a very good jumping off point for such discussions.  If the plight of those who are oppressed and whose human rights are violated by their own government isn't an issue important for children are aware of, I'm not sure what is.  The book also has a lot of important themes about compassion and complicity.  In a world like Panem, compassion might seem like a very dangerous emotion, as it may distract a person from their fight for survival at any cost.  But is the moments of compassion and grace in the book that underscore our capacity as human beings.  Even in the face of a world gone mad, compassion is the one emotion that guarantees there will be some light, some hope in that world.  As the book shows, the act of complying is far more dangerous because it removes something essentially human from us, leading us down the path toward indifference to the suffering of others.  As children enter their difficult teen years, these are extremely important themes.  It is at this age that children are first beginning to learn that, while it may be easier to comply, the only way in which to be able to live with one's actions is to live with compassion.  As powerful as the novel's themes are the novel's main characters.  Though Katniss is the embodiment of the survivalist and Peeta is the embodiment of compassion, they are both more than that.  Katniss especially is extremely complex.  She is neither a hero nor a villain, but a very human character trying to cope in a brutal, heartless world.  Her actions are sometimes selfless and sometimes selfish, but she is always someone with whom the reader can identify.  How could anyone possibly know what is truly in their heart when dealing with the sort of reality with which Katniss has been forced to deal?  I was simply blown away by this novel.  It deals with so many important issues without being at all preachy.  Instead, by making the world in which Katniss and Peeta live so violently, disturbingly real, the reader can do little else than think deeply about the issues central to the book's themes.  By allowing the reader to live vicariously through Katniss and Peeta, it enables us to form a deeper, more profound understanding of what it means to be a human being, and what it means to be truly courageous.
The Hunger Games is clearly meant for marathon reading. When I started, I originally thought that I would get bored and stop reading, but it proved me wrong. It is set in futuristic Panem, a post apocalyptic country in what used to be North America. The Capitol, in the Rocky Mountains, controls everything in the 12 Districts.  Each district produces a certain thing' for example, District 4 is on the coast and has fishers, District 12 is on the other side of the country, in the Appalachian Mountains, and has coal miners, District 11 is in the Plains and farms, etc. In the past, there was also a District 13, in present-day New England. District 13 was destroyed 75 years before in the resistance against the government.  The story begins in District 12, the poorest of all, with Katniss Everdeen preparing for the annual Reaping. After the resistance, the Capitol came up with a yearly televised event called The Hunger Games. 2 girls and 2 boys from each district are chosen as tributes at random each year at the Reaping and are forced into an Arena in the Capitol to fight to the death. The last tribute standing is the winner, and them and their district is showered with gifts and food. Katniss's younger sister, Prim, is 12 and is about to go to her first Reaping. Although her name is only in the mix once out of hundreds, Prim's name is called. Immediately, Katniss rushes to the stage to fill in. The male tribute, the baker's son Peeta, helped Katniss years before when she and her family were literally starving by giving her a loave of bread although it meant a beating for him. She says goodbye to everyone and is presented with a small pin of a Mockingjay, a Capitol created bird used to hear and replay what rebelling districts were saying. This becomes her one district symbol to wear inside the Arena.  She is then whisked off to a train and taken with Peeta to the Capitol. On the train, they formally meet only surviving winner from District 12, a drunken Haymitch. He agrees to become sober long enough to help one of them win. When they finally arrive, they are overwhelmed by the abundance of food and wealth in the Capitol when most districts are starving. With only a few days until the Games begin, they have a lot to do, starting with the parade of all tributes on chariots riding through the Capitol. Each district must dress their tributes according to the job of that district. Most years, District 12 tributes dress in miner's suits, but this year the stylist has a different idea. Peeta and Katniss dress in black shirts and pants, and once it's dark, an illusion of flames flies up on the black. The crowd loves them, and labels Katniss as the girl who was on fire. At the training sessions, they are told to save their best abilities for the private training sessions, during which the Gamemakers give the tributes a number-1 being the worst or least likely to win, and 12 being the best or most likely to win. Katniss grew up illegally hunting with a homemade bow and arrow that her now dead father made for her, so she is exceptionally skilled in archery. She shows that in the private session, but becomes annoyed with the Gamemakers being more interested in their lunch than her and shoots an arrow at their food. She then smiles and walks out. Surprisingly, she gets an 11-the highest score out of all of the tributes. At the interview, Katniss and Peeta are dressed in formal wear with another fire theme; she wears a jeweled yellow, orange, and red dress and he wears a suit with fire accents. When it's her turn, she spins and the crowd loves her even more. When it's his turn, he bravely confesses his love for her.  The cameras go to her to see a shocked and slightly offended face. Peeta and Katniss are now known as star crossed lovers, as either one or both must die by the end of the Games. Now, they must pretend to be in love to get sponsors. When it begins, the Arena is revealed as a forest. The Cornucopia is in the center, filled with weapons, food, and supplies, with items of lesser value the further away you get. When the gong rings, Katniss takes a sheet of plastic and a backpack and runs into the trees to get away from the bloodbath and find water and shelter. She sleeps in a tree in the sleeping bag that was in her bag. In the night, she hears Peeta with a group of careers, rich tributes that have been training their entire life for this. She feels he's betrayed her but manages to survive. Soon, she befriends a 12 year old tribute named Rue, who helps her stay away from danger and find food. While planning on raiding the Career's camp full of food and supplies, a mine goes off and Katniss loses hearing in one ear. When she finds Rue, she is being attacked by a boy. Rue is stabbed and soon dies in Katniss's arms. Katniss shoots the boy with an arrow she got when she indirectly killed a girl with poisonous bugs. She finds shelter when an announcement comes on saying there may be 2 winners if the last 2 tributes are from the same district. She searches for Peeta and finds him incapacitated by a river. They make camp in a cave. At this point, only Katniss, Peeta, a boy, a girl, and a career named Cato are left. They are called to the Cornucopia to retrieve something "very important to them." With Peeta dying from blood poisoning, Katniss goes and is stabbed but makes it back. Healed, Peeta accidently kills a girl by leaving poisonous berries out. Finally, the final battle takes place and Cato is killed. The announcer comes back on saying the previous announcement was revoked and there can only be one victor, forcing either Katniss or Peeta to die. They decide to each eat the poison berries and both die, but at the last second they are stopped and taken up as co-victors. At the interview, Katniss finds out that the leg that Peeta had blood poisoning in was replaced with a fake leg. The government is furious with Katniss for trying to mock the Capitol's games by almost committing suicide. She claims to have been driven crazy by love and making bad judgments. On the train back home, Haymitch lets it slip that Katniss never really loved Peeta and it was just an act for publicity. He is furious and continues the act just for the public. The book ends with them leaving the train holding hands.
The world is changed, yet eerily familiar, in Suzanne Collins' fantastic novel The Hunger Games.  In the country of Panem, Katniss Everdeen is getting ready for the Reaping.  Every year, children between the ages of twelve and eighteen have their names put in a lottery.  Two names are selected from each of the twelve Districts, one boy, one girl.  The twenty-four people are then rushed off to the Arena in brutal combat on live television for the pleasure of the citizens of the Capitol.  And while the Capitol people laugh and bet on the odds, the rest of the people of Panem watch on, rooting for the success of their district's tributes, and praying that their kids will make it through the fray.  These Games serve as an annual reminder of what happens when you go against the Capitol.  Collins has constructed a mesmerizing world filled with characters to love and loathe.  The people of the twelve districts are burdened and oppressed.  Food is always scarce.  Freedom is severely limited.  Panem is not a pretty place to live, unless you live in the Capitol.  Many of the ideas aren't necessarily original, but the story is so well done and well written that it's impossible not to like.  Katniss, a 16-year-old girl, lives in District 12 with her mother and her little sister.  She spends most of free time illegally hunting and using the game to provide for her family.  Her life is hard, but manageable.  Her father died in a mining accident, leaving her mother a shell of a woman.  I find it difficult to say a lot about The Hunger Games without going into spoiler territory.  I haven't cared about characters like this in a long time.  Katniss is an excellent protagonist.  Smart and witty when she needs to be, but still a teenager, occasionally thick-headed and silly.  In fact, every character in this book is one of high quality imagination.  The Tributes are all pitiable, but highly intriguing.  The supporting cast--Cinna, Haymitch, and even Effie--all appear like real people that have cares and worries.  The plot is very fast paced, told in a first-person POV through Katniss.  I read the book as an audio copy and thought it was well done.  I was eager to pick the story back up and see the fates of the people I'd grown to care for.  I can't think of anything that I disliked other than the fact that some of Katniss' realizations sometimes take too long to come to fruition.  Then I need to remember that she's a young girl with a lot on her mind and I shrug it off.  Overall, The Hunger Games is an amazing read.  Characterization is top-notch.  The writing style is very smooth.  The word usage is often spot-on and perfect.  And the story is simply breathtaking.  If you're looking for something dystopic, totalitarian, and post-apocalyptic, then definitely read The Hunger Games.  Or, if you just want a great book to read, this is it.
With all the buzz surrounding 'The Hunger Games', I've half a mind to believe it's all an exaggeration. It's not the first time that a novel purported to be all the rage turn out to be so-so after I've tried my hand in it (like 'Water for Elephants' and 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower').  (Don't worry, I myself was disappointed with my own reaction to those.)  But then I later found myself still sitting up into the late hours of the night, turning page after page of Collins' novel. It was gripping. Adrenalin-pumped. Throw in all the clichs. The point is this is a highly-enjoyable read. Really.  It poses questions on the threshold of being human and the probability and capacity to do something unspeakable when it is one's life and survival at stake.  What lengths would a group of people be willing to go through in order to enforce an ideology? How is fear and subservience conditioned? And when does TV and reality cease to become distinguishable?  Intensely psychological, the Hunger Games held regularly in the wasteland that was North America to keep people on the line strike at the very heart of the descent into dystopia. Teenagers are plucked and made to battle each other to the death in a controlled environment, with a victory signaling food and comforts for the winner's District - that is, until the next Hunger Games.  In a lot of ways, this is one of those novels that serve as a wake-up call to the shenanigans that people nowadays are occupying themselves with. If went unchecked, the premise of shows like `Survivor' - where betrayal and the constant need to serve only one's own interest is highly encouraged - will be taken to extremes, all for the name of entertainment and who knows what else (Food? Shelter? Safety?).  This is a highly-recommended read. Interspersed with its healthy dose of excitement (and even grim, morbid undertones) is a story of a young girl who was forced to sacrifice a shred of her humanity for the sake of her starving family back home and her newfound friends in the arena, Rue and Peeta. The fate of Rue, especially, made me cry.  And when there are waterworks, well...that only means one thing.  I loved it.
My daughter is an extremely picky reader, but this book thoroughly engaged her.  I kept finding her up waaaay past her bedtime with it (and was so thrilled about this that I just let her keep right on reading).  Given her enthusiasm for this one, I had to read it also.  I loved it. The characters and plot are engaging, the details are satisfyingly addressed, and the first thing I did after finishing it was to request the sequel from the library (also very good, by the way).  Pros: The book features a strong female character with spirit, brains, and ingenuity; her male counterpart is full of good-heartedness and solid integrity.  I like that it focuses on the benefits of being resourceful and thinking outside the box, something I think is so important for kids to start exploring at this age (Grade 6+).  The main character spends a lot of time weighing her own motivations and trying to do the right thing, but isn't presented as an unflawed mary sue.  The concept of sacrifice for the greater good vs personal integrity are key plot elements.  The main character listens to her own intuition and judgement, and does what she knows to be the right thing, even under enormous pressure from others.  Again, this is the age where kids are really starting to experience this sort of stuff in real life, and can't have too many positive examples, even if they are fictional.  Cons:  It's a little dark, being a book about kids who are put in a gladiator-like scenario to fight to the death while their battle is broadcast live to the rest of the nation.  There is a definite theme of mistrust for authority (the government is corrupt in this series), which may upset some parents.  There are some tones of sexual manipulation-- nothing more than mild kissing, but the motivations are political, not emotional.  Again, this is not something that bothered me personally (actually thought it another great example of the main character having to wrestle with her own integrity in weighing the needs of the many vs. the needs of the one vs. the right thing to do), but it might upset some.  One of the more featured adult characters is drunk a good part of the time, and depression is featured in passing.  Although the main character is female, there's enough action to satisfy a young reader of either sex.  It's also multi-layered enough for any adults who are looking for a quick, enjoyable read.
The Hunger Games is pretty much non stop tension. Rather than pausing at the chapter breaks, I'd find myself plowing through them and having to stop at midway points when necessary. Mostly I'm glad I actually did read it now, though, even if it means I'll be waiting on pins and needles for months for the release of Mockingjay. For once I actually know what everyone is talking about! And I want to talk about it too!  There are pros and cons to borrowing from history. One definite pro is that retrospect lends credence to practices that we might immediately consider too heinous to be realistic. Every time I caught myself thinking, "really, Suzanne?" (and it was often) I would remember that she's actually only showing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the shocking behavior of a conquering nation. I read The Robe and Quo Vadis, watched Ben Hur, and pored through dozens of history books on Rome as a teenager. It's easy to think, "nobody could ever be that heartless" (thanks, Emperor's New Groove), but history proves that wrong over and over again. The human heart is desperately wicked. Despite my initial knee-jerk reaction, I think Suzanne Collins did a great job of making the horror realistic and almost understandable.  First person point of view can be tricky. I think of Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, which most of my friends either adore or detest. I've noticed that those who love it tend to relate to the tentative personality of the protagonist, while those who detest it find her introspection and lack of action to be maddening. While there were definitely times during The Hunger Games where I was frustrated with Katniss' choices and perspectives, there was still a part of me that understood her caution. "So, fearing, I taste not but with trembling. I was tricked before." -- C.S. Lewis (Sweet Desire -- best poem ever) Speaking of Lewis, it's kind of like at the beginning of Narnia when the reader is baffled that nobody will believe Lucy. But in real life, would you believe such a tale? So while I do find Katniss to be a bit slow in the uptake when it comes to interpreting others, I can also relate. I know when I was a teenager I was always wrongly guessing people's motivations, certain that nothing could be as simple as it seemed.  I've read and watched plenty of dystopian children's stories, and I can see why The Hunger Games has risen to the top with her gripping story and compelling characters. I am definitely looking forward to seeing how Suzanne Collins wraps up the series with Mockingjay in August (counting down!).
I like young adult books. I've always preferred story and character to fancy wordplay and ambiguous symbolism, so books like the Harry Potter series can be the perfect fit. When my friend recommended The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, though, I was a bit nervous due to her love for The Twilight Series. We share very similar tastes except for that large exception. I read some reviews, did my usual research, and decided to give the book a chance.  I'm very glad I did. The Hunger Games is a satisfying start to what promises to be an exciting series. Is it a surefire classic? Not quite, but it certainly is memorable. The novel's premise isn't new: the protagonist is thrust into a life or death reality show/event set by a corrupt government. Being a big Stephen King fan, I've explored this territory before with The Running Man. In this case, it's Katniss Everdeen, a teenage civilian in the poorest district of the nation, and the Hunger Games is the show. In order to survive, she must outwit and kill twenty-three other teenagers. The crux of this book becomes surviving all of the brutality while at the same time retaining one's humanity. Not your typical young adult fare.  That's really what separates The Hunger Games from everything else - tone. The are multiple deaths, self-sacrifice, and mutilations in the book, ensuring that readers under the age of thirteen shouldn't tackle this novel. Some may consider the gruesome parts unnecessary, I see it as Collins respecting her readership. Young adults don't need to be coddled, they can stomach morbid details, as well as deal with heavier themes. Katniss questions the morality of her government, her peers, and herself, and so should the readers.  One minor complaint I have is that everything seems to fall into the lap of Katniss when she desperately needs help. I mean, things literally appear out of thin air to aid her. Sure, there's a logical explanation for this - contestants each have sponsors who can send them gifts during the Game - but it made things too predictable. Every time Katniss found herself in a sticky situation, I would think to myself "don't worry, help is certainly just around the corner". It would've been nice, and more realistic, if she had had ongoing issues that forced her to adapt and evolve rather than simply wait.  Still, I found the book's ending to be excellent, and I can't wait to start its sequel, Catching Fire. It feels as if the story is just about to open up. It's also worth mentioning that Collins writes excellent characters. Katniss is one of the absolute best and most believable female protagonists that I've ever read. Collins partly achieves this through the use of the first-person point-of-view, a perspective I'm not normally a fan of, and she pulls it off excellently.  The Hunger Games is a fast-paced thriller that never really lets up. And just enough information is given about the history of the nation, the Capitol, and the Games to make you hunger for more. If Catching the Fire and Mockingjay (the third book in the trilogy) deliver on everything promised in The Hunger Games, then the series could very well end up being a classic.
Collins has created a gripping epic of a story, which is an arguably darker combination of the already dark stories 1984, Lord of the Flies, and the short story The Lottery. I certainly couldn't put the book down from beginning to end, however I found myself thinking the text was very dark and not suitable for younger readers. In fact, I was reminded of stories like The Bluest Eye, which is a text involving children as the main characters, but is often banned from various school reading lists and regarded as a book not suitable for kids.  That disclaimer aside, this is one of the better books that I've read in a while, and it certainly deserved all the press and awards that it's received. I'm sure that several production studios will consider it for a film, which is bitter sweet in my opinion. This would make a great movie, but it would be incredibly dark.  On the literary front, this is a perfect example of a dystopian society, which is the best kind of science fiction. Also, what makes any good science fiction novel really good is the subtle or not so subtle hint that all of the terrible things going on in the story are palpable at some level. It seems a little farfetched that our society could turn into this, but it's not far from where Rome was just before its fall and the degradation of art and culture had reached its limit with rampant incest and duels to the death in the Coliseum. Even now, reality TV is not a far cry from the gladiator games. How long will it be before we want to be entertained by watching people compete by killing each other?  However, what makes this book amazing, in my opinion is that Collins has taken a relatively original idea (possibly pulling from sources like the Japanese film Battle Royale) and really flushed it out in a phenomenal way. The great travesty with science fiction and fantasy books is that many of the authors have great concepts, but are terrible writers, leading them to flood the market with books that have great elevator pitches, but are, in reality, not that great. Contrary to popular belief, I don't think that Collins has given us a truly original story, but what made Chaucer and Shakespearre so great, among other things, is that they took well-known stories and rewrote them with their literary genius.  The way that Collins writes the story through the eyes of Katniss creates empathy for the reader, and makes the dark world tangible and the characters she's interacting with three-dimensional. Katniss is always believable in every action and decision, making her a reliable narrator, and therefore, making the other characters reliable as well. In doing so, the story's underlying messages are communicated clearly and effectively, showing our own society a mirror of itself and what it can become if we don't start moving in a different direction. I recommend this book to all readers 14+.  The other books in this series so far are Catching Fire (book 2).  -Lindsey Miller, lindseyslibrary.com
Ines, 8th grader: The Hunger Games, set in the future of North America, is an amazing book. It's the first book of an outstanding series. The series is written by Suzanne Collins. The book tells the story of a girl named Katniss. She lives in a country called Panem ( future North America. ) once a year they have an event called "The Hunger Games." This is probably why the book is entitled The Hunger Games.  This is when one girl and one guy from each district ( 1-12 ) is chosen to play in the hunger games. Although it may sound cool, it isn't. During the hunger games, the 24 people chosen are put in an arena with no way out. Well, no way out but to win. And the only way to do that is to kill everyone else in with you.  Katniss, along with the boy from her district, Peeta, face numerous problems while in the arena. Some involve wounds, burns, and near death situations.  Katniss is an amazing hunter and a strong independent girl. Her father died and after that her mom completely disconnected from life. She was left to take care of her younger sister Prim, with no one by her side.  To get the food on her table every day, katniss goes into the woods after school, along with her best friend, Gale. They hunt until dark then trade in what they have earned. This is just to show you what life can be like in Katniss' world.  If she were to win the hunger games, Katniss would live in luxury. Not having to worry about the lack of food or the water.  At some point in the book, katniss will realize that she has to lie to the audience and act like she is in love with Peeta. While,  it is quite hard to explain why now, I will tell you that it involves keeping her self alive.  If you were to ask me about the book while I was reading it, I would tell you it was great.  Almost every chapter ended in suspense, leaving you curious, and eager to read the rest. There are so many twists and turns through out the book, which is why I love it.  You see, for kids between the ages of 12 and 15 who don't do much reading, this is a great book. And personally, I enjoyed reading it. Basically, we can relate to it. The book's theme is all about love, friendship, and family. These three things become a major part of our lives.  Keeping your life balanced is hard, especially at this age. This book shows and helps you learn how too balance your school life, with your love life, while overcoming obstacles that the world may throw your way. Whether it be life threatening or not.  The Hunger Games is an action packed, interesting, suspense-filled book.  I can almost guarantee that you will love it.
Daniella, 8th grader: North America. When you hear those two words, what are the first things that enter your mind? Technology? Hollywood? Fast food? Well, for Katniss Everdeen, a 16 - year - old girl who survives on the animals she hunts, those two words won't bring up anything. She lives in the future, which changed North America into Panem. Panem is separated into 12 districts and it's Capitol. In Katniss' district, which is District 12, the space is barren. District 12 specializes in coal mining, so it's not exactly the cleanest place on earth. District 12 got the worst end of it all since some districts above it live a life that is more luxurious.   Though, in the Capitol, the technology is phenomenal. They've conjured up any type of medication for any type of disease. They had it all. So why would they leave some districts as they are if they had enough money to make it as shiny and spotless as the Capitol? The districts had to produce. And with each district, there's always something different.   Katniss is one tough girl. She knows how to handle things with intelligence and grace. Since her father died in an explosion, her mother has been an emotional wreck. She won't cook for her family and she won't provide for them. So it was Katniss' job to bring food home and onto the table and to take care of her little sister, Prim.   The title of the book says it all. To keep the people of Panem entertained, the Capitol issues a boy and a girl from each district to participate in the Hunger Games, a televised " game " where the " tributes " have to compete for the prize - their lives. They are put in a wasteland where you have to fight for all the essential needs: food, water, medicine and weapons. If you can't fight, then you're a goner.   Suzanne Collins really captured true love through Peeta Mellark's eyes. Peeta is the boy drawn for the Hunger Games from District 12. He's had a crush on Katniss since forever. What's ironic is him feeling lucky being picked to participate in the Hunger Games. But only because he would be with Katniss. During the course of the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta strive to keep each other alive, and this shows all the feelings he has for her.   Katniss wasn't actually picked to be in the Hunger Games. Prim was. Katniss couldn't bear to send her little sister there, though. She knew it would be painful for her and her mother to see another one of their family members die, so Katniss stepped up to the plate and offered to replace Prim to keep her safe.   To me, the start of the book isn't that interesting compared to the body and the end. I like reading about romance more than adventure and action, so when Peeta and Katniss were reunited in the Hunger Games arena, it got me biting my nails more than ever to find out if their crushes would blossom into something more. I have to say: I think I have a crush on Peeta Mellark than on Edward Cullen. But they're both different individuals and both have different attractive qualities to them. Peeta would be the sweet boy who's real and Edward would be mysterious mythical creature.   Katniss and I are pretty different. I don't know how to hunt, or how to fend for myself let alone my whole family. She's got a lot of guts to do that. Katniss would conceal her true feelings, whereas I would let mine spill and show. And when it comes to survival in the forest, I wouldn't stop and think twice about eating berries because I'd be too hungry to.   If it weren't for the romance factor mixed in with thrilling adventure sequences, my rating wouldn't be a 4.5. The Hunger Games really captured my attention, but at first I thought it wouldn't be something I would like to read. This book wouldn't really be good for anyone younger than 10 for they wouldn't understand the story as much and there are too much big words for them to know. I, for one, love it and hope after you've read this review would find it thoroughly exhilarating and love it, too.
Bea, 8th grader: This is one of those books that cannot be put down because of the excitement it brings to the reader. This book is called "The Hunger Games" which is an adventure ride filled with action, love, and life from the very start. The author, Suzanne Collins (a brilliant writer), always puts fresh and new features to the characters that can keep you up through the night.  The story is set in the future in a place called Panem which is made up of twelve districts controlled by the Capitol. The Hunger Games was created by the Capitol to remind the other districts never to rebel. Two kids from each district (male and female) from the ages 12-18 are chosen as tributes and placed into an arena where they must fight to the death every year.  The main characters are from District Twelve. Katniss Everdeen is one of them. She lives a life of poverty with her young sister Prim and her hopeless widowed mother. She puts herself at a risk everyday by hunting in illegal grounds with a bow and arrow in order to hunt for food. Her intentions are good since her father died. In her journey you will find that she is smart, skilled, and a bit stubborn. Still she is on top of the game, and so is Peeta Mellark.  Peeta Mellark lives a comfortable life unlike Katniss. He does not struggle as much. He lives in a bakery with two older brothers, a baker for a father, and a witch-like mother. Peeta is a strong boy who can lift heavy things and wrestle. Not only is he strong but is clever as well. He managed to slip inside the opponent's side keeping his real intentions and plan along the way.  From my point of view, the story is about sacrifices, family, love, and survival. Love and sacrifices, because Katniss was not supposed to be picked but she could not bear to let her twelve year old sister enter the games. Family, because Katniss took on the role of being the head of the family and made sure that they had something to eat most of the time even if it was very little food she could provide through her hunting and barter skills. To stay alive and survive the games, so that she could go back and care for her family was Katniss' goal.  It was Peeta's love and sacrifices for Katniss that helped them survive the grueling games.  This book is appropriate for young and old readers alike. There is violence in some parts and sad deaths but the romance was kept at a rate where it was sweet and not to explicit or extreme either. This book managed to keep me going on to find out what happens next till I realize the time. And even though I finished the book I still wonder how the second book will be like since the first book revolved around the games. Who knows, maybe Katniss and Peeta will stop the Hunger Games once and for all, or there could be a bigger problem back at district twelve. Maybe it might skip to the next batch of tributes and their own adventure. But all I can say is that the book kept me at the edge of my seat and maybe yours too.
With 435 existing Amazon reviews about this book already, maybe I'm just adding to the noise, but Suzanne Collins's THE HUNGER GAMES is the best book I've read in quite a while.  First off, having read many other reviews of this book, both from Amazon and professional reviewers, I see that this book has been slammed by some as being a rip-off of several, or even dozens of, other books / movies.  I suppose if I had read some of these other books, I might feel less impressed by this title - or maybe not.  This year's Newbery Medal winner, THE GRAVEYARD BOOK by Neil Gaiman, was an admitted rip-off of THE JUNGLE BOOK.  However, Gaiman transformed it into something entirely new.  Likewise, John Christopher obviously used THE WAR OF THE WORLDS as the basis for his phenomenal Tripods Trilogy / Quartet, but made it into something new as well.  Many other children's / YA books could be seen as rip-offs of previous books (though probably unjustly so) - Gary Paulsen's HATCHET is very much like the little-known earlier book STRANGE COMPANION by Dayton O. Hyde.  THE CITY OF EMBER seems inspired by H. M. Hoover's even better book, THIS TIME OF DARKNESS.  And, though they each stand on their own just fine, several of Gloria Whelan's recent novels with strong female leads seem like direct knockoffs of... well... Gloria Whelan's earlier books with strong female leads.  So, in reviewing this book, there seem to be two major categories of reviewers - those who've encountered some of these earlier works (BATTLE ROYALE, RUNNING MAN, LORD OF THE FLIES, THE LONG WALK, and others), and those who have not.  Since I have not read most of these (though I love LORD OF THE FLIES), I can't compare THE HUNGER GAMES to them.  Others have criticized this book for being too predictable, though children's / YA books are supposed to have at least a bit of predictability - otherwise, we wouldn't have what is known as a story arc with the introduction of a problem, rising action, climax, and resolution.  I've read a handful of books that "don't seem to be going anywhere," and I've hated them.  Collins did do a fair amount of foreshadowing, something I think is great to use with students in reading and studying books together, helping them develop their own skills of prediction in books.  If I was using this book with students (which I won't, as it's too "mature" for my fourth graders), I would definitely use it with the context of foreshadowing.  (spoiler alert) I was able to predict the change in the rules of the game (though it happened much later than I thought it might), the double-suicide threat (How many times was the term "star-crossed lovers" used?), and that Cato would likely be the last opponent left for a big battle scene - for me, the ability to predict these things MIGHT happen did not take away from the story.  I will leave the other reviewers to handle the summarizing of this book, but I thought THE HUNGER GAMES had all the elements of great storytelling - lots of character development, maximized action and conflict, inventiveness, conflicting emotions, and great lessons for the reader (sticking to your beliefs, helping others when possible, believing in yourself, and others).  I'm greatly looking forward to reading CATCHING FIRE, book two in the trilogy, upon its upcoming release - can't wait!
Katniss has grown up in a poor community in which people barely scrape by. This community and others like it are kept poor by a strong central government bent on preventing rebellion. One way in which the government asserts control is by hosting the Hunger Games. This annual event is a lottery of sorts: a boy and a girl from each community is conscripted and sent into an arena. The conditions in the arena are unpredictable, and even access to food and water is uncertain. The task at hand is, simply, to kill one another until only one person is left standing. That person wins.  The Hunger Games are required televised viewing for all citizens. Those who live in opulence eagerly follow it as a reality TV show; those who live in the oppressed communities are compelled to watch by law, and helplessly stand by as their two representatives struggle to survive.  It's compelling to witness Katniss's struggle to survive in the arena. She faces some formidable opponents and goes up against nature, human-made weapons, and a resourceful "production company" that is bent on keeping the Hunger Games interesting for its audience.  The reader is complicit, pulled along, rooting for Katniss. This leaves us uncomfortably close to the opulent Hunger Game fans in the book. We're in suspense, following each twist and turn. This is disturbing, to at once condemn a cruel social practice and yet to be riveted by its presentation as a reality TV program. This makes it easy to see how our world could get there from here.  The book is marred for me by a certain lack of plausibility. It's a great suspense novel, and a really good character study, but there were a few too many convenient turns of events. The biggest flaw in this book is that Katniss is conveniently spared moral culpability on several occasions. There is always a mitigating factor to make her actions OK; yet, when her opponents kill and maim, they too often relish it. It's too pat.  Still, I couldn't put this one down -- and I'm looking forward to readingCatching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games), the next book in the series.
In a future North America, now called Panem, Katniss Everdeen lives in District 12. There Katniss hunts to feed her family and to trade and sell for other necessities.  Once a year a lottery is held  to choose two teens, one boy and one girl,  between the ages of 12 and 18 to fight in The Hunger Games. Katniss winds up representing her district and she knows that she will be forced to fight to the death.  I have been seeing a lot of buzz around this book on the blogs and since I tend to really enjoy both survival stories and futuristic societies, I was thrilled to find out that there was no wait for this at the library. Either I beat the buzz to my branch or I am way behind it, I'm not sure which.  Katniss is a real survivor. She steps up and takes over the responsibility of feeding her mother and sister when her father is killed, she doesn't like owing anyone anything, she faces her lot in The Hunger Games with grit and determination and she is as smart as anything when it comes to outfoxing her opponents. She is tough, abrupt, and almost mean at times and that's to the people she likes.  Coming off of a sickness-induced reading slump, this was the perfect book to get me jump-started. Once I picked it up, I didn't want to put it down. It's violent and disturbing but I expected that once I knew it was about a death match and the circumstances which changed North America into Panem.  My only complaint is that I wish we would have seen more about the government. I kept wondering if I was seeing clues to a revolt or things not being what they seemed as I read. I guess I will have to wait for a sequel.  There's also a sort of a love triangle going on here but, again, we will have to wait for the next book to see any resolution on that front.  I thought the names were a little lame but I really enjoyed reading this book and am looking forward to the next one. (4.5/5)
This story is set in Panem (think the United States post the effects of global warming)composed of a ruling Capitol, which lords over the surrounding districts. As a way to express their authority, every year the Capitol hosts a gladiatorial event where one boy and one girl from each of the districts engages in a highly-publicized, highly-televised fight to the death. When Katniss Everdeen's sister is called to the competition, "Catnip" volunteers to take her place and becomes the girl "tribute" from District 12. To lose would be to devastate her family and to win would mean everlasting celebrity, but the costs of victory could be too much to bear.  Suzanne Collins knows a thing or two about how to hook her readers - this book is incredibly suspenseful and nearly impossible to put down. In many ways, the story reminded me of "The Giver," a staple of my childhood library. Though both words are very different, the ideas its characters struggle with are very similar: identity, independence, persecution, morality, etc. Collins creates an environment that forces her readers to think about what makes a society function, why it works or does not work, and what its values are or should be. We are asked to identify with some of the most lowly on the social totem pole, to root for the underdog when everything is at stake.  In general, this is a very good bit of writing and I would highly recommend it to young adult and adult readers, but I will say the the ending frustrated me. Though I understand that this book is intended as part one of a series, it feels as though it has unfinished business and looses its footing as a stand alone novel. The sense of conclusion and satisfaction felt at the end of a "Harry Potter" book is the result of a smaller story arc within a much larger story. In "The Hunger Games" it seems we are given a piece of a larger story arc, which made me feel as though my own hunger for this story was never truly satiated. That along with the particular eye-roll inducing name of Peeta, the baker's son, prevented me from giving this book five stars, but it will not prevent me from picking up the next book in this series.
The world in "Hunger Games" is anything but perfect.  At least this is true for the denizens of the twelve districts that surround the Capital.  Those in the districts struggle by day to day to get enough food to survive, while life in the capital seems to be pretty good.  70-some years ago, the districts and the Capital went to war.  The Capital, with its highly advanced technology and well defended cities, won, and as punishment both obliterated the 13th district and imposed the Hunger Games.  Every year, each district will supply a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to compete in the Ultimate Game of survivor.  Viewing of the Games is mandatory, as the districts are forced to watch the 24 teenagers enter the vast outdoor arena.  Only one of them will leave it alive.  If they do well, the people outside might spring for some extra supplies to be sent to you, providing an extra edge.  Victory means a life of comfort for you and your family, as well extra food for your district for the year.  Defeat means you get sent home in a box.  It's "Survivor" meets "Gladiator."  Does that sound interesting to you?  Because that premise is really probably all you need to know.  In sharing the idea of this book with my students and peers, there have generally been two reactions:  "Hey! That sounds cool!" and "Ummm, no thanks."  If you feel more of the latter, then I think you can safely pass on this one, and look on to other things.  But if your interest is piqued at all, then this is a book you should make an effort to pick up.  The book is exceptionally well written.  Katniss is a strong, believable main character, whose skills and determination lend themselves well to the Games, and will be popular with both boys (for her ability to survive and fight -- my favorite involves her creative use of genetically altered bees) as well as girls (for the lovey-dovey stuff).  The narrative moves at just the right pace.  There is action, there's sadness, and even humor.  Yes humor, woven into the story in all of the right places, mostly through Katniss' observations of the world's ironies.  Fair warning, however: the book does end on a cliffhanger.  "Hunger Games" is what appears to be the first of what will become a series, and the choices last surviving players of the game make towards the end of the games have consequences that we have yet to see play out.  For my part, I'll be picking up book two the day it comes out.  But really, in the end, this is "Survivor" meets "Gladiator" done very, very, very well.  And really, for better or ill, that's all you need to know.
It's difficult to find the right words to even describe how good Hunger Games is.  I would definitely place it on my top 5 list of all times and I have read hundreds and hundreds of books.  Katniss is such an engaging character.  The reader is drawn to her instantly, as we are plunged into a futuristic world of oppression, poverty and despair.  Katniss has taken on the responsibility of caring for her family after her father died in a mining explosion and her mother shut down.  Katniss is daring and ventures out into forbidden areas to hunt and gather food to sell to the people in her "district".  Her only goal in life seems to be keeping her little sister safe.  The government has set up a lottery in each of the twelve "districts" in this futuristic country.  One boy and one girl are chosen to go fight to the death with the "tributes" from the other eleven districts.  When Prim, Katniss's little sister, is chosen for the Hunger Games as they are called Katniss steps forward and volunteers to go in her place.  Katniss goes to the capitol with the other tribute from her district, a boy named Peeta, and there they must put on a good show before the game begins.  If they set up the right image they could get sponsors during the game, which means they will receive gifts and help once they enter the arena.  Sponsors are the difference between life and death for many tributes so it is important to give the people what they want.  The game itself is brutal.  It reminded me a tiny bit of the show survivor, only in this game you have to kill off all the other players.  Katniss has a slight advantage from her hunting and gathering experience, but she must also use her wits and bravery to keep herself alive.  Foreign alliances with other players can be helpful, but true trust and friendship is practically impossible since there can only be one winner.  The book drives its characters to the very edge of their abilities.  We see how people react in the most primal and brutal situations: forced to kill or be killed.  I loved seeing the tributes come up with different strategies for survival, and how the game makers who control everything in the arena throw the tributes at each other through force and bribery.  I read this book yesterday, and had dreams and nightmares about it all night.  While this book is reminiscent of "The Giver", "1984", and "Brave New World" it has its own voice and its own story to tell. At the end of the book you will be left starving for more and I can't wait for the next book to come out.  I still can't quite capture the essence or brilliance of this book through the words in this review, so all I can say is go read it and you will understand.
When you first start this book, if you've seen the movie the Running Man with Schwarznegger, you're thinking this is just a children's version of the movie.  Not so.  Meet Katniss and Gale, two friends and hunting companions.  Meet Prim, Katniss's little sister.  The day of the Reaping has come.  On this day every year everyone in the districts (what was once North America) gathers.  One girl and one boy from each district are chosen to play in the Hunger Games.  Only one child can come out of the Hunger Games the victor.  They must kill each other until only one stands.  The winner is then wealthily, never goes hungry again, and gets a big fancy house to live in.  Prim, who's 12 years old, is chosen, Katniss takes her place by volunteering for the games.  Certain her life is now over, the boy is picked, Peeta.  Katniss and Peeta know each other vaguely.  After being taken away and put through all the presentation ceremonies they are thrown into the arena.  But they have a plan.  If they play at being in love perhaps the rules will change.  Peeta does all he can to protect Katniss.  On camera their every move is recorded for all the districts to view each night.  Coached to show their caring for one another, it became clear to me, Peeta wasn't acting.  There is a lot of action in this book.  And I actually cried when Katniss's ally is killed.  And I wanted to slap Katniss for most of the book because to me it was obvious Peeta really does love her, he's not just acting as thinks he is.  This book was a real page turner for me.  It's a story about a cruel nasty world written by a brilliant author.  I could not wait to finish it to see what happens to Katniss, Peeta, and Gale.  It's tragic, lots of death, to kids becoming adults and leaves you ready for another book.
I'm not quite sure what I thought the Hunger Games would be about when I picked it up (Amazon recommended it) so I was a tad disturbed with some of the Lottery-like imagery. Despite several loud comments from a friend (to whom I had described the plot a few pages in) that I should just "put the book down and walk away," I perservered and finished the book. I'm really glad that I did.  Katniss Everdeen has been providing for her family since her father died in a coal mine a few years ago in District 12 (Appalachia). Her mother is an apothecary but couldn't care for either Katniss or her younger daughter Primrose (Prim for short) right after her husband's death. All three would have starved if not for Katniss' hunting abilities.  As if life wasn't cruel enough in this post-apocolyse world, every year one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts must be sent to the Capitol (somewhere in the Rockies) to participate in the Hunger Games. The participants are chosen on a lottery system with every boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 putting at least one name into the pot. 12-year-olds must put in one slip, 13-year-olds two slips etc. Life is so poor in some parts of the district though that you can enter your name more than once to receive a yearly food stipend for your family. On Katniss' first entry into the reaping (the lottery) she entered herself four times: once for the requirement and then once for food for herself, for her mother, for her younger sister. Moreover the slips are cumulative so Katniss will enter at least 8 her second year and increasing her odds of being chosen to particpate in the Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games are held each year to remind the Districts of their loss and the participants are rightfully called 'Tributes.' Once all 24 names have been chosen the Tributes are taken to the Capitol to prepare for the televised games (which are mandatory for the districts to watch). Only one Tribute can survive the Hunger Games and the reward for winning is a life of luxury and fame. No one from District 12 has won one of the Hunger Games in 30 or so years and the last winner spends all of his time drunk.  The odds are against Katniss the year that her beloved younger sister Prim is forced to enter her name into the reaping. She has 20 or so slips in the pot with her name on it and made sure her sister would only be putting in her obligatory one entry. Despite the odds, Prim's name is chosen and Katniss, knowing her younger sister would definitely not survive the Games, volunteers to go in her place.  I did see many plot points coming (the banding together in the arena for one) but others were unexpected (her coming to truly care for her comrade Peeta) and it was a violent and bumpy ride. The effect at the end though was cheering as Katniss stands against the system. I look forward to the next book in the Trilogy and hope it clears up some of the lingering questions I had since the book ended so abruptly.
is that this book came out in fall of 2008 and I read it in January of 2009. Now I have to wait for what I'm sure will seem like AGES for the sequel to come out.  Needless to say I loved this book. It's nice to see a girl/woman take charge and be truly resourceful. There are no princes waiting in the wings to save her. She is her own champion. Katniss lives in a world so desperate that love is stretched to the limit. What will you do for your sister? Will you starve for her, commit illegal crimes punishable by death for her, and even die for her? What will you do when a stranger saves your life with a simple gesture? Owe them forever? Save them in return at the cost of your own life?  With the livelihoods of her sister and mother resting on her shoulders Katniss's situation seems to harsh for her to keep any bearing on humanity. What is the point of morality when you are watching your loved ones starve? Yet, even in the middle of the brutal Hunger Games in which her life and death struggle is merely an amusement for the wealthy she has a respect for human life surpassed by no one else. Unlike those with lots of food and comfort she does not have the luxury of caring about anyone but herself and yet she helps, saves, and grieves over the lives of everyone she meets. She's not sickly sweet, innocent, or annoying. But she does everything she can to be honorable and kind just as she does everything she can to survive a senseless bloodbath in which she's expected to kill anyone who crosses her path.  And I can't wait to see how the Big Brother "Panem" is to be dealt with in the next two books. Katniss is not one to back down from a fight and it it's obvious from the beginning that the eventual confrontation with "Panem" will be the biggest fight of her life.  Also I'd like to see just how the Peeta-Katniss-Gale love triangle turns out. Peeta (a kind, gentle, and even sweetly vulnerable baker's son) and Gale (a resourceful, cautious, capable, strong coal miner's son) seem to represent different sides of Katniss. Perhaps Katniss's choice between the two is more relevant to the world of Suzanne Collin's little post-apocalyptic book than what at first seems apparent.  I don't think this book is to bloody for most kids. I think that one of the important points to take away from this book is that life is harsh, tough, desperate but that doesn't mean we should give up or hide. Actually, I think a book like this might even be empowering for most kids. As a kid, I would have loved Katniss and would have wanted to be strong like her. Heck, I do now as a twenty something.  Please Mrs Collins! Write your sequel fast!
I started reading this around 7:00 PM last night and I couldn't put it down after the second chapter. This hasn't happened since last July (when I was addicted to The Good Earth by Pearl Buck). I love to read, but I have a craplod of schoolwork so if I can't get into a book by the second chapter, I usually just toss it. I really do look for the "can't-put-it-down" books, because who doesn't love that "this book is so awesome I can't stop!" feeling, but those books are hard to find for me. I am glad to say that this book was definitely a "can't-put-it-down." I was supposed to be studying for midterms but The Hunger Games so engrossed me that I just couldn't let it go. I was up until 5:00 AM, and it took me on a thrill ride. I laughed, cried, and found my heart pounding at the all scary parts.  I didn't get any of the derivate references Stephen King made (I'm a HS senior...soon to be second semester senior yay! and I've never watched those movies before in my lifetime) so all the plot details were pretty new to me.  However, for those who started the book but haven't gotten into it, I was sort of in the same situation. I read the first chapter and laid it down for a week before I started it up again. My initial impression was that the writing was kind of abrupt and Katniss (oh, yeah, I was also like: Katniss? Really? but it grew on me) was kind of angsty, but like someone mentioned Ms. Collins manages to make Katniss and the style really likeable. I also loved the love interest thing.  Katniss' uncertain obliviousness was definitely believable (unlike, well, Twilight) and was kind of waves-of-giddiness-inducing for me as a girl.  Anyway, Ms. Collins' storytelling is just amazing. The adventure aspects of this book just brought it to such a great place. She really makes your heart pound. I expected it to be kind of preachy but it really was not, although as I read on I wondered how she was going to resolve the society they live in and depose the Capitol, considering there weren't that many pages left. And then I realized it was a trilogy so it's all good, although the ending kind of left me clawing at the door. I really wanted to know what happened.  My sister and I read the library version. We are probably going to go buy the hardcopy because it was so awesome.  Ms. Collins, thank you for writing this book and I hope anyone who reads these reviews will pick up the book as well, because it really was a blast.
Suzanne Collins has single-handed perfected a story that not only leaves you wanting more, but also leaves you really thinking about the content of the story and the characters as well.  Set in a not-so-specified future, The United States is gone and North America has become Panem. Panem is a dictatorship that puts most negative Utopias' to shame. It's dominated by TV, technology, and aestheticism; all of which is ran from a city called The Capitol. Panem is then divided into Districts, at one point there had been 13, but District 13 decided to rebel and was then destroyed because of the rebellion, leaving 12 Districts. That rebellion caused The Capitol to institute The Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games themselves is worse then any reality show ever thought up (it's the product of what everyone else want to do to the Hills'). Each year 24 teenager's names (2 from each District) are drawn lottery-style and those 24 "tributes" are condemned to be thrown into a gladiator-esque battle to survive. They are thrown into the "arena" to decide who wins a life on easy street and who loses...their life; those are the only options. All of which is televised big brother-style, betted on, and sponsored.  Katniss Everdeen is our narrator/heroine, the female tribute from District 12, offers herself up when her younger sister's name is called to be another contestant in the next Hunger Games. District 12 is the poorest of all the Districts and hasn't had a winner in 30 years, that winner is now alone, a drunk, and the laughing stock of Panem. The other contestant being the baker's son Peeta, whom she has a growing affection for throughout their time in the "arena" but is complicated by her affections from her friend and illegal-hunting companion Gale.  The Hunger Games is light on the romance, concentrating more on the Darwinian aspect of surviving the other 23 tributes in the arena. Of course there is enough of the romance that you can't help but wonder, who will Katniss end up with, but the suspense of the chase, the violence, and the controversial nature of the book make it impossible to put down. The Hunger Games is one of the most addicting reads that I have picked up in a long time; it reminds me of the way you'll stay up all night and all day just to beat one of those addictive shooting games, no matter how much you know it's not real even when you're done, you still want more.  Being the first book in a trilogy, some may not want to follow and wait the long wait for the next book or may not want to stick around and see what happens to Katniss, but I know I'm already looking for Amazon to allow me to preorder the next installment in Suzanne Collins' newest story.
In this book North America is now known as Panem which is made up of The Capital and 12 districts.  At one time there were 13 districts but when the 13 districts tried to over flow the Capital they were defeated and the 13th district was destroyed.  Now every year each district is forced to pick one girl and one boy between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the Hunger Games which is televised live.  These games are a fight to the death and the winner will receive a life of luxury and their district receives extra supplies from the Capital.  These games are a way for the Capital to remind the districts of the consequences of defying them and the power they hold over the districts.  Katniss Everdeen is now 16 and ever since her father died has taken care of protecting her mother and sister and providing them with food.  When her 12 year old sister is chosen as their district's female contestant she volunteers in her place.  The male contestant, Peeta, is a son of a baker who once purposely took a beating in order to provide Katniss with two loaves of bread.  Katniss surprises everyone by becoming a serious contender to win the games.  Stop here if you don't want any spoilers.  I really enjoyed this book although I hate that it looks like it is the first book in a series.  I hate reading series when the next book is not readily available.  Katniss and Peeta play up that they are two teens in love in order to gain more "sponsors" that can provide helpful items during the Hunger Games.  It's obvious that while Katniss is only playing a part, Peeta does really love Katniss.  To add an added complication is it sounds like Katniss's hunting partner back home, Gale, also has feelings for her.  So when the rules were changed and allowed both Peeta and Katniss to win the games and go home I wanted to see what would happen.  Would Katniss end up with Peeta or Gale or neither.  I really want to learn more about Gale.  Peeta seems like a nice guy but he seems more like the good boy who will always be there but will be kind of boring.  I'm wondering if Gale is going to be more of the forbidden love even though he and Katniss are from the same walk of life and Peeta is from a slightly richer life as a baker's son.  The only part I didn't like in this book is when Rue is killed.  She sounded so adorable and can't help liking her even though she isn't in the book very long.  I guess that is what Collins was going for since she was played up as the contestant that people couldn't help but root for even though she was only 12 and very small.  I can't wait for the next book to come out and see how the romance plays out and what the Capital has in mind for Katniss for embarassing them into declaring two winners of the Hunger Games.
While the first chapter of the book is a little slow and gives the false illusion of being another cliche young adult sci-fi, it's essential for the remaining 95% of the book.  You fall into the character of Katniss (yes, a lame name...) and get thrown into an adventure of survival.  The plot is compelling, leaving you to wonder will she (and as other protaganists are added, they) live or die.  The characters live in a world where they are under tight control of the government.  The government lives in the rich and modern capitol, enjoying both these luxuries and exercising their power through abandonment and brutality.  The majority of the people live in twelve districts that each specialize in some form of production (agriculture, mining, etc.).  The districts are left with little sustinence and some are poorer than others.  Katniss resides in the twelfth district (the mining district).  Her home is one of the weakest, full of starving people and virtually no luxuries.  Our protaganist is stong and determined, providing food for her family and carefully placing her trust in only her close friend Gale and her sister.  The governments most flamboyant show of power is through The Hunger Games: A televised show of twenty-four people, aged twelve to eighteen, fighting to be the final victor.  To be the victor, that person must be the last one standing - with all others dead.  As is predicted, Katniss lands a spot on the show.  From each district, a boy and girl is chosen.  They are randomly picked, but a person may choose to volunteer, taking one of the spots for their district.  Katniss volunteers to take the place of her sister who is randomly chosen.  The boy chosen is the banker's son, Peeta, who once saved Katniss and her family from starvation by tossing her some burnt bread.  Katniss has never spoken to him but feels somehow indebted to him.  The contestants are takent to the capitol, spiffed up, and left to make an impression on the audience through interviews.  The better they come off in the interview, the more likely they are to get sponsored.  Getting sponsored means that during the game, the contestants can recieve gifts to help them win.  During the interview, Peeta and Katniss make an impression as Peeta declares his love for Katniss.  She believes he is only playing that up for the games, but eventually (a very distant eventually) she realizes he really has been in love with her for a very long time.  The most interesting part comes at the start of the game.  You're constantly on edge waiting for someone to get stabbed in the back - literally.  From here, you must read the actual book or find a reviewer generous enough to spoil the fun, because I certaintly won't.  Enjoy.
Have you ever read a book that wiped out all your favorite books? That changed your life, your perception of the world? That you couldn't believe you hadn't read, even if it came out only four months ago? The Hunger Games is one of them (I have only had two, sorry The Book Thief, you've been demoted). Even though some readers of this wonderful book might of read it only because Stephenie Meyer put a little blurb about it on her website, I read it for a different reason. I got the idea from Ms. Meyer but didn't read it because she said it was good. I read it because it looked so unique, so interesting, too good to pass up. Oh boy I was right. I breezed through it in a day, four hours I believe, and now I am starting to regret it, mostly because there is no sequel yet, and truly I cannot bear to wait for it.   The book follows a girl named Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the future. Katniss lives in the country of Panem, the ruins of North America. In Panem there are 12 "Districts", each of which have a specialty. Katniss, along with her mother and sister Prim, live in District 12, the coal-mining district, where they struggle to survive. Every year the Capitol (the ruling seat of Panem) holds a competition called The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are Panem's punishment for a previous rebellion against the country that lead to the obliteration of District 13. Each district, on reaping day, sends a boy and a girl to the Games. There are therefore 24 12-to-18 year olds in all.   Anyhow, on reaping day, Katniss's sister Prim's name is called. Without hesitation, Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place. Katniss and the other District 12 representative, Peeta, are sent to the Capitol. Peeta and Katniss have a past, a past they cannot erase...   In the Capitol they are fed rich food, taken to interviews, and pushed around the arena in gorgeous outfits. Peeta and Katniss, supposedly under direction of their always-drunk mentor, have to pretend they are in love to win the crowd's support. There hasn't been a winner in 30 years from District 12, so one of them needs to win. When the games begin though there won't be all this luxury though. There can be only one winner of The Hunger Games, and Katniss is determined to win. But alliances must be made, foes must be fought, and loves need to be protected.   I couldn't put this book down. From the first page I was drawn in and stayed there. This book wasn't as gory as I thought it would be, although the savagery is enough to make your bones chill. The characters, every last one of them, was interesting and well-thought out. I cared for them all, even Katniss in her oblivious moments. There was humor too.   It is hard to explain, the feeling I got when I read this. I loved how they had to survive, how they had to stay themselves in this harsh new world. It really got me thinking, this book, about the future. It wasn't sci-fi or anything. It actually showed what our world could look like if some bad people and things came along.   The Hunger Games was such an original idea. The things Suzanne Collins did to her characters were stuff they would actually do. For the first time in a long while, I actually felt as though the characters were teenagers, not adults in a teenager's body. They may seem grown-up and mean and savage, but these characters had to survive. Some of them did a great job at it, others not.   And of course the romance. A love triangle, between Gale (Katniss's best friend from home), Peeta, and Katniss. I must say I like Peeta better. The Games can never be taken out of them both. It bound them together. I loved the things Peeta said. You could tell he really meant them. They made me all tingly, how much he loved her and Katniss was being an idiot and it nearly killed me. I liked Katniss, but sometimes I wanted to knock her on the head for being so stupid. She should pick Peeta.   I cannot WAIT for the sequel. I need it to come out soon. Very soon. When a book like this comes around, don't pass it up. It might change you.  P.S  As I have read more into the Battle Royale resemblance I have discovered something. Sure, the plot sounds the same but I highly, highly doubt that Suzanne Collins saw either the movie or the book and went "Wow. Why don't I Americanize that?" Look at her videos people. It is all around us, the violence and obsession with TV and reality contests that inspired her. After I read THG, I went "Wow. This is like our society, only worse, but it in maybe 150 if something goes wrong." And anyhow, it was said that Battle Royale was like Lord of the Flies, which goes to prove that there are only a few plots. I defend Suzanne Collins in this, and I am a teenager myself. You guys shouldn't go and try to ruin it because it sounds similar. Just read it, savor it, and reflect on it. I've got to admire Ms. Collins for writing such a novel, even if she later found out it would get such non-praise. Because guess what? It is a wonderful novel in its own right, and I am proud to call it my FAVORITE book of ALL time.
Young adult novels have always had a dark side, so to speak; a sub-genre that eschews peer pressure and turbulent relationships for death, despair, and destruction. This is not a recent trend. For everyDeath Noteyou find today, you can find an equally disturbingZ for Zachariah. While much of today's dark teen novels lean towards the supernatural, you will occasionally find one that ventures into more classical science fiction territory. Suzanne Collin's newest YA novel, The Hunger Games, does so quite successfully. The setting is grim and oppressive, the characters are desperate and hopeless, and the specter of death hangs over every page. And every page will drag the reader eagerly to the next.  Strong and positive female leads are important in young adult novels, and The Hunger Games has the perfect hero in Katniss Everdeen. She is tough, resolute, intelligent, and able. Yet, she still struggles with the same confused feelings and emotions that young girls need to cope with, even when not fighting to the death in a government sponsored reality show/snuff film. As she struggles to survive the deadly prime-time death match she has been unfairly thrust into, she deal not only with these typical teenage dilemmas, but also greater issues concerning government, society, morality, and honor.  All of this might seem like a lot for one book to handle, but Hunger Games manages to do so without coming off too preachy or instructional. Granted, the Hunger Games themselves (which are very reminiscent of previous books like Stephen King'sThe Running Man, or Koushun Takami's manga seriesBattle Royale), as well as the post-apocalyptic dictatorship Panem that holds the event, might not hold up under the scrutiny that hardcore science-fiction novels sometimes demand. But for a young adult science-fantasy novel like this, demanding one-hundred-percent social-political realism seems a tad unfair. What matters is that the characters and setting support the characters and subject matter, and manage to do so with the captivating suspense of any mainstream paperback thriller.
In my Teenreads.com review of THE SILENCED by James DeVita, I noted that we have a love of dystopian novels. I think it's because we, as humans, like to be right. We like to be able to make correlations between the conditions we see in the world and possible scenarios about how those conditions could achieve Worse Case Scenario status. It's frightening, really, that we should want to be right about that. Maybe it could be that we're glad other people (authors) seem to share our concerns about our direction --- as a civilization, as a country.  I admit: I'm a sucker for a good dystopian novel. In my mind, a GOOD dystopian novel doesn't settle for simply presenting a bleak set of circumstances and warning, "This is what could happen if we don't change our ways." A GOOD dystopian novel forces us to become emotionally invested in the people who are affected by the bleak conditions. A GREAT dystopian novel goes a step further and makes us want more. THE HUNGER GAMES by Suzanne Collins, author of the Gregor the Overlander series, falls into this category.  The story is set in Panem, part of what used to be North America until an epic disaster rent civilization asunder into a chaotic tailspin. Rising from the ashes is the Capitol, a nightmarish totalitarian state, and 12 Districts kept under the painful thumb of the central Capitol government. The Capitol rules ferociously after an attempt at uprising several years earlier that resulted in the obliteration of a 13th District. To keep the remaining districts in line, the Capitol devised "The Hunger Games," a brutal competition for which each district must supply two "players" (known as tributes) between the ages of 12 and 18. The 24 tributes fight to the last person standing in a wasteland-like arena where they compete for basic survival supplies while every moment is mandatory televised viewing for all citizens.  When her younger sister is randomly chosen to represent their district, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her place. She is sent to the Capitol with her district's other tribute, a baker's son named Peeta, where they are forced to participate in a macabre pageantry (complete with make-up artists and celebrity interviews) that leads up to the deadly games themselves. Once she enters the arena, Katniss must face her murderous fellow-tributes (some have been training for years in the event they were chosen) and decide if Peeta is an ally or an enemy. However, the decision seems to be a moot point because, as the rules stand, only one of them can emerge alive from the arena.  Collins's dystopia is somewhat old-fashioned --- mass, seemingly uncalculated oppression --- compared to more recent entries, such as LITTLE BROTHER, which is firmly grounded in a more clearly attainable reality. But I think the old-fashioned approach is part of the charm of this book (if, indeed, you can attribute the word "charm" to something that offers such a grim outlook). Collins crafts a vivid, frightening world where the citizens are worked to the point of exhaustion, starved to the point of collapse, and humiliated beyond the tolerance of any sane person for the entertainment of the elite. The heart of the book is the characters. Katniss is brave and caring, Peeta is smart and smitten. Anyone can scare readers by presenting a future devoid of hope, but it takes a skilled writer to create characters we dare to hope for. Collins has accomplished just that.  You'll be hearing a lot about THE HUNGER GAMES in the weeks and months to come, if you haven't already. There's good reason for that. If you're like me, you have an unrelenting pile of "to be read" books. Take my advice: nudge this one closer to the top.    --- Reviewed by Brian Farrey
The "unquestionable goodness of the Capitol" has organized the country of Panem into 12 districts to provide for the needs of all.  The "Capitol" provides food and yet everyone is hungry.  The "Capitol" provides doctors who just shrug when someone is injured and tell families to let their loved one die.  The "Capitol" provides "peacekeepers" to keep people safe, but no one is safe.  The "Capitol" genetically alters animals to eavesdrop and report on the populace so people school avoid "tricky topics" and keep their faces from showing any emotion.  "Criminals" have their tongues cut out and are labeled Avox.  To keep the general population of Panem in their place and distract them from their misery and isolation,  the "Capitol" drafts two young people, a girl and a boy, between the ages of 12 and 18, as "tributes" from each district to fight, to the death, in an Olympics style extravaganza called the Hunger Games.  Broadcast live on television, the whole country watches and hopes for the survival of their tributes.  Alas, the rules specify that there can only be one survivor.  Gladiator meets Lord of the Flies meets American Idol meets Survivor.  The young people are fashioned and styled and interviewed on TV to maximize their appeal and encourage sponsorships.  Then the 24 kids are released into a landscape where the climate can be manipulated by the Capitol. It is kill or be killed.  Without a doubt this is one of the most frightening but compelling books I have ever read. Collins's writing conveys the horror of the games. We feel the characters' fear, exhaustion, and pain.  Even as they struggle to survive, the contestants are aware of the need to play to the camera.  The narrator is a young girl named Katniss, age 16, who is used to the woods and hunting for her famiy's food but that alone cannot save her from the others.  Like all good dystopian stories, there are elements of truth and echoes of reality that make readers shiver.  Hurry, book 2, please.
One of the biggest reasons I loved this book isn't because every chapter literally ended with a sentence that made you want to keep reading or because of the romance (which is usually what wins me over, I must say). Rather, it's how deep of a level it reaches. I just finished it, so naturally there hasn't been enough time for reflection, but in these few moments, my stream of thought is going spastic. The book jacket wasn't lying--there's mystery, adventure, romance, suspense, all of that in here. And yet the substance of the novel surpasses just these box-office-hit qualities (which is all I can compare those four adjectives to).  The world building was fantastic. While it's quite a different land than current North America, Panem had some disturbing parallels relating to the society, especially of its higher class (the lower-number districts and the Capitol). The fixation with the sappy romance, the fact the games were more like a deadlier reality show of nowadays than anything else, the frivolousness... It was quite unnerving. So clever. Only adds another layer to this story.  Not many books have kept me on the edge of my seat. This plot is brilliant. Truth be told, I'm not the biggest fan of thrillers and am fine with books that employ the "girl-next-door" dynamics to its plot--quiet, but charming and accessible. Well, needless to say, this book is anything but quiet. But it is bewitching.  You know what? I'll stop. There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. Plus I could stay here all night. I wasn't kidding when I said my mind is going spastic with all the directions this book gives it to think things out.  Not recommending it to everyone though. Some really hate violence. Some really hate dystopia. I'd still give it a shot if you're one of those people, but I wouldn't specifically recommend it to you. Everyone else? Knock yourselves out. This is one of the ultimate must-reads right in front of you.  But in short: this book is AWESOME.
Although I usually try to avoid this situation, I watched the movie before reading the book, for several reasons including not hearing much about the HG until the movie since I tend to avoid the young-adult section. However, this didn't take away from my enjoyment of either. Suzanne Collins's writing style took some getting used to for me, only focusing on one character's perspective (Katniss), amongst other reasons, but it really was difficult to put the book down much of the time, which I don't say very often.  One thing I didn't care for in the story was how Katniss seemed a bit too astute in her social skills, making shockingly accurate assumptions about pretty much everybody throughout the book. I don't question her maturity and hunting/survival skills, but for an anti-social, poverty-striken, traumatized, undereducated teenager she precisely guessed what people she barely knows were thinking, and stereo-typed everybody else. Due to the author's focus on only Katniss the depth of the other characters suffered, which the movie deftly avoids. I also don't buy the basic concept of Panem; it didn't seem very plausible to me and I doubt it would be able to function for even half the time that it does.  Because of the reasons mentioned above, as well as its predictability and deus ex machina plot devices, I would rate this book 3.5+ stars (rounding up) and admit those points are relatively minor; though they do add up. Despite all my criticisms the Hunger Games really is a great story that is vividly written and I recommend it for people in the target age group and above. Having said that; however, I think I actually liked the movie better than the book, which is something I thought I'd never say.
Thrilling read indeed! Author has you hooked from the first page! With great detail you are drawn into each scene and can easily picture each setting! Absolutely love this and will be reading the entire trilogy as well as anything else from Collins!
I am always late to the party but I do eventually get there.  The same with The Hunger Games.  I kept saying "no, not interested".  Guess what? When I finally bought the book I couldn't put it down and then the same with the other two of the series.
Book on audio   If you like non-realistic books, than this is the book for you. The Hunger Games hooked my attention from the first page. It has a lot of realistic problems in the book, like sacrificing people to the capital, so that only two people from each district will have to die. This is an amazing non-realistic book. They used great detail about the fights that some of the kids had so that you can imagine the movie in your head. I really liked this book because it would never happen in real life, but it is a cool representation of the world if we had only a king and queen dictating what we did, or how we lived. The book is very similar to the movie in the fact they still had all the main points and who got killed. It was nice of them too have explained in great detail the train ride to the capital and all the fancy items that were in the train for them to eat and use. The book goes into great depth with all the descriptions of what is going on and what smells and scents are around.  I am a college student and love to be in the forest and hunt like the main characters. I am the type of person who loves to read thrillers, love stories, and suspense. There was so much that I could relate to in this book. I am really into books that relate to real life but isnt fully the truth. Books that  exaggerate the truth are my kind of books. After the first page I couldnt set it down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I was always wanting to know what happened to the people in the game and who would actually win. If you liked the Divergent series you would love The Hunger Games series as well. Over all a well-rounded, great book to read if you have the time to read it.
Wow. Ok, I am a very fast reader, NEVER has it taken me this long to read a book. Seriously, it took an extraordinary amount of time to get through. This book is all things I am not, and what it must be like to have the brain of Suzanne Collins....  I guess I've been under a rock for awhile, because I knew only that I wanted to read this, didn't know what it was about or the immense hype surrounding it. Honestly it wasn't as violent as I thought it would be (or could've been), and it was totally void of foul language, which was a first for me. It was fast-paced but I had a million thoughts slowing me down: "is this sci-fi?", "is this what the future could be like?", "is this a political statement?", "is this a sociopolitical statement?", "am I reading way more into this than I need to?", "wait a minute, green skin?? Maybe this is just sci-fi....", "nope, this is definitely a symbolic book." And so it went for 378 pages...I read one page, then went back two more pages just to make sure I got all of the details correct (then I got to the very end where it states the book was symbolic...but of war LOL. I was still thinking about everything I learned in my college Sociology class).  I hate to try to add something that will put a label on the book, and the only thing I would want to convey intelligently is the depth of it. I read one review about the guide to this book, and the woman basically says if you need the book dumbed down then you probably shouldn't be reading it. I actually thought there were multiple ways to interpret it. I may not be all that deep but I was definitely left pondering issues that are, and always have been relevant in society. Well written, looking forward to the next book.
In The Hunger Games, the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, volunteers herself to compete in the annual Hunger Games.  This 24-person fight to the death competition is conducted every year by the tyrannical Capitol to remind the 12 outer districts of their control and discourage rebellion (something that caused the Capitol to completely demolish district 13).  This novel is a great introduction into the social science fiction genre for the young adult community.  When we begin discussing the possibility of our future with climate change and global warming, the premise of this novel, where the expansion of the oceans force the people of North America further inland causing them to reorder their government, doesn't seem too far fetched.  As a teacher, I am always on the lookout for novels that will appeal to my male and female students, and this novel fits the bill.  For the girls there is the added interest of the underlying romantic tension between Katniss and her partner Peeta along with Katniss' conflicting feeling for a young man back home.  The boys will love the survival aspect of the novel that at times feels like guerilla warfare.  The violent scenes are done well for young readers with plenty of tension and excitement, but not a lot of unnecessary, gory descriptions.  My only warning is for the reader to remember that this is meant to be the first book in a series.  So although there are hints at a rebellion against the Capitol, this novel is meant to serve the purpose of introducing us to characters and the world in which they must survive.  In other words, you will definitely be left wanting more at the end of the novel, which is a good thing.  All in all, I'd highly recommend this novel to my own students.
Okay well i love Katniss and Peta and think they should be together.  So Katniss is chosen to be the girl contender for the annual Hunger Games where the 13 districts compete to the death. This is a post apactaliptic novel. So Katniss is chosen as the girl contender and Peta as the boy contender. I know"OH NO". So the districts meet up in Capital and meet the others. Oh and you can only be chosen if your between the ages of 12-18. SO there are 12 year olds in here. They train for the battle and Katniss and Peta's Trainer guy that helps them along is always drunk and passed out. They don't think they have any chance of winning. They have a challenge type thing were they show judges their skills and get points 1-12 on how well they did.Katniss is the best on bow. Lets just say Katniss got an 11! So based on this score you get sponsers. Sponsers help you throughtout the games like sendsing you food or medicine. As the games begin there is a huge caticomb in the middle of a feild that has all sorts of weapons. Katniss runs toward it to get a bag that was left off to the side. She almost got killed. So as the games continue. She meets Rue a 12 year old girl and they stick together. I'll let you find out what happenes. An annoncer comes on air and says two contenders are allowed to win the hunger games from the same district. Katniss automatically looks for Peta. They stick together and pretend they are in love to make sponsers suppot them. They end up the last two people and then the announcer revokes the rule that two contenders could win. Katniss and peta say they can't live without one another so they are about to take poisoned berries when the announcer says they both win. The Capital is angry with them now.
A book about a bunch of kids killing each other? Last one standing wins? I began reading with a bit of skepticism, but the unusual present tense gave the story a sense of immediacy and quickly drew me in. I enjoyed Collins's language, jarringly sparse in the action scenes and beautifully descriptive and symbolic at the rare moments of lull. Fast-paced and actioned packed.  However, while containing deeper and better developed characters than Twilight, the story was still at its core surprisingly shallow for modern YA, which is supposed to appeal to adults as well as teens. The main character Katniss, while not happy with her situation, never bothers to question it or consider how things could be different. While survival is naturally the number one thing on her mind, her inability to look past it to what could be made her very unlikable for me. Also, the fact that Katniss set out ready and willing to kill anyone who stood in the way of her winning made me stop caring whether she lived or died. If she had started out with the intention of just watching and waiting, biding her time while the others duked it out, I would have liked her a lot better. I also didn't quite buy her angst at the end. She just survived the hunger games, and all she can think about is whether to like Pita or the other guy. That didn't seem consistent with her character and her ability to fake almost anything. Overall, I tend to like more uplifting books, anyway, so I'm probably not the target audience.  That being said, however, the novel is perfect for an adrenaline junkie and a fast read. The world is carefully crafted but not obtrusively so, and I felt right in the middle of the action. A great start to the series.
The Hunger Games By Suzanne Collins is an amazing book that starts and pulls you straight into a world where a Capital has been raised from the ruins of North America. The capital made 12 districts that live in fear, once every year The Hunger Games are held, a live TV show where 24 contestants, a boy and girl (between the ages of 12-18) from each district fight to the death. We follow Katniss from district 12, a girl who is a hunter and knows how to survive at all costs. But she soon realizes she may have to rely on more than her skills to survive    The book is intelligent, heat pounding, and suspense filled. The main character is very realistic and easy to follow. She is a strong female character that doesn't  need a boy to help her. The beginning of the book is slow and it takes time to paint a picture of the world these characters live in. You learn exactly how Katniss came to be such a good hunter and the live she lives in a district ruled by a capital. When she gets picked and whisked away to the capital the book picks up and you are trust into a world of lies and betrayal. Once the Games begin I recommend you either take a break or get ready for a long read because the rest of the book is a wild ride that sends you in different directions action scenes and game twists. There is something for everyone, action and lots of it, a spark of sci-fi, a love triangle (but nothing sappy or cliche). Teens, both boy and girls can love it, as well as adults. I very Highly recommend you read it.  A  P.S A movie is in pre-production and could be an amazing movie if they just have the right cast and scrip. If im not wrong the writer is helping with the scrip so look out for the next huge thing!
I stumbled across this book when I first got my Kindle.  I immediately downloaded and read it.  In fact, it was so good that I stalked the sequel, checking nearly every day until they made it available as an ebook.  THE GOOD:  -Katniss is a strong likeable character.  She is unique and fierce with a depth of character I have rarely seen.  -All of the other character are just as good and distinct.  -The plot and relationships are completely unpredictable, and kept me turning pages--the most into a book I have been since the Inheritance Trilogy (Eragon).  -The next book in the series was not anticlimactic like so many are--built on and deepened the plot.  THE BAD:  -The Capitol is a bit one-dimensional.  Why do they oppress the people?  Just because they like the power, or are corrupt, or honestly think they are doing the right thing?  This is never explained, and we just see the Capitol as the indistinct "bad guy".  Of course, more detail could show up in the third book.  CONCLUSION:  The book is an amazing read, one I have read three times in the last eight months, and that I intend to read again right before the third book comes out.  I would recommend it to anyone, no matter the age group or genre preference.  *CONTENT*  Sexual:  There is some romance, but no real sexual content--nothing past kissing.  In this area, it is appropriate to any age group that can read.  Violence:  By its very nature there is violence and killing.  It is not overly descriptive--any more than necessary, and it acknowledges the wrongness of killing.  I tend to have trouble with gory or scary books, but this one did not bother me.  I would recommend it to teens and up.  Language:  There is no profanity that I can think of.
this a great book it talks about romance staying alive and of corse hardships . its action packed and i cant wait to read the rest of series p.s if discouraged by the movie at least reed the first fifty pages who knows maybe you'll love this series
Katniss is a volunteer tribute for her sister prim and her soon to be lover is a tribute as well their are some parts where I so overwhelmed by emotions and have to take a sec to just calm down it was a very gruesome at times and sad as well thanks
i couldn't put it down! i was on a countdown ever since they announced that it was going to be a movie. This book is my favorite in the trilogy. I am currently on a countdown until Catching Fire comes out..... 7 months and 18 days..... and counting
I could not put this book down. It's the kind of book you stay up way past your bedtime reading and then make time to read in the middle of the day. I read the second book in the trilogy even faster than this one. Highly addictive reading material!
Absolutely loved this book, did not want it to end but could not wait to read the next one in the series once it did! This is the type of book you find yourself sitting and reading for hours because you just can't put it down - highly recommended!!
Have you been caught up in the hype about the Hunger games trilogy? You should be. The series is a well written, disturbing saga of the dystopian world of Panem, whose totalitarian Capital controls it's twelve districts with harsh and cruel practices. The major device is the annual Hunger Games for which each district sends a male and female tribute to fight to the death. In return for participating in the games, food and other supplies are made available to the districts.  The disturbing heart of the saga brings you to face the cost of survival. What are you willing to do to secure survival for yourself, for your family unit, individual family members and other human beings. Suzanne Collins' characters face this question on every page of the three novels. Her flawed characters don't always make the decision you want. The pace is so fast for both the characters and you the reader that bad choices are bound to happen.  The trilogy is a painful illustration of Lord Acton's quote, "Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely." This concept of absolute corruption drives Collins' plot, keeping the reader thinking, it can't get any worse than this, only to find it does. It makes the books hard to put down and opens the door for sleepless nights.  History shows dictators always forget how strong the will to survive is in humans. It can be harnessed for a time, but it will break through eventually. And even in the most tightly controlled regimes there are cracks that can be exploited.  Although the saga comes to a true conclusion, it didn't bring me peace. The Hunger Games trilogy is a beautiful and ugly depiction of the human spirit. It's not for the faint at heart.
This review is for the Kindle version.  I purchased this title because the book has received so much chatter that as a writer-in-training, I had to know what all the buzz was about.  Was it as good as the zillions of people said?  I'm very persnickety about fiction and it is rare that I come across a book that is difficult to put down.  And frankly, I'd never even heard of "dystopian fiction" before this book.  There's a bit of a catch-22 in reading much-hyped books.  You go into it expecting to be served pure gold. While I wouldn't say it was pure gold, I will say it is an excellent book.  It was good for a number of reasons:  1.  It was very relevant in a time when our world seems to be careening out of control. Yet even in the aftermath of catastrophic times, these characters take hard times and put them into a sense of order and still live by a code.  2.  I have never been a fan of 1st person POV but found the lead character extremely engaging and barely even noticed that it wasn't my usual POV style.  3.  This book makes you think--the surest sign of a high quality novel, in my opinion.  Books you read and forget about two hours later are published in the thousands.  This book has you pondering and making comparisons throughout.  4.  This book instantly shut off my internal editor.  Unfortunately, with most books I read I can't shut off my internal editor.  In the case of The Hunger Games, my internal editor was never even given a chance to kick in. 8-)  5.  It leaves me with questions.  What will happen to the characters after the story's close?  You can't help but wonder.  Even if you don't read YA, Sci-Fi, or dystopian fiction generally, I can assure you that you will definitely enjoy this read.
It is rare that a book with the relentless pace of this one can hold my interest. Ironically, it's usually the quiet, emotional moments that keep me turning pages, rather than than the fast paced action people are generally referring to when they call a book a 'page-turner'. Despite my usual tastes, I think I ended up loving this book so much not because the action scenes were just that well-written, but because the narrative never loses sight of the emotional stakes for Katniss. Often in such books, if a character is in a life-or-death situation, the author doesn't feel the need to show you why these events matter--its just taken for granted that of course the character doesn't want to die, doesn't want their loved ones to die. And though survival is at the center of this novel, the emotional stakes are always high as well. Plus the emotional landscape is varied--often writers will attempt to do what I just described by picking one person the protagonist cares for, and repeatedly throwing in lines about how much they love them. This would have been easy to do with Katniss's sister, but her love for Prim is shown through Katniss' actions, rather than limited only to throwaway lines. And there are many other people she cares about, in different ways. This is all conveyed expertly despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that the narrative is mostly action, not dialogue, description, or internal monologue.  I won't describe the plot because I think everyone knows that. I just to encourage people who don't generally like action/adventure type stories to read this book, because it is so much more than just a thrilling and suspenseful story. But it is that, too, so action fans will enjoy it as well.
I have been a reader since I was very young. I enjoy all genres. The Hunger Games is well written "on the edge" book. The action never stops. I fell in love with the characters from Katness to Haymitch. Gale, Rue, Cinna, and of course, with Peeta.
Don't let the popularity of this series fool you into thinking that it is anything  like the Twilight series. The Hunger Games is well written and does not read like young adult fiction. It's a story of bravery that you will not want to put down.
I bought The Hunger Games trilogy last year. Then the books got stacked up and forgot about having them. Knowing that the movie starring Jennifer Lawrence was about to come out, I took a slight break from my review piles and opened the first book. It was late at night, I was tired, and I was not planning to read very much. Well, I ended up reading about half of the book, as I was caught up in the futuristic, weird world of Panem, which strangely resembles the real world. The story is told from the point of view of sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen (What a name!) who volunteers to take her sister's (Prim) place in the annual Hunger Games that the Capital holds. There were once 13 Districts in Panem, and the 13th rebelled against the Capital. After the 13ths were vanquished, the Capital decided to punish the other districts with the Hunger Games. Each year one male and one female (between the ages of 12 to 16) from each district are randomly chosen to participate in the games which only has one main rule, fight to the death.    Katniss is well aware that she volunteered for a death sentence. She is great hunter, thanks to her late father, and is an expert with a bow and arrows. She has much better chance of surviving than her other District 12 constant, Peeta - the son of a baker. With the guidance by District 12's only winner, Haymitch, who somewhat trains them before they are tossed into a forest like arena. Airing on Live TV, the 24 contestants must fight to the death.    The Hunger Games reminds me of the Running Man by Richard Bachman (A.K.A. Stephen King), but with teenagers. Suzanne Collin's narration is wonderfully crafted with a slight razor edge to it.  As a reader, I was instantly hooked into the story and felt for Katniss as she struggled to survive in the violent arena. Considering all the reality TV rage in our culture, we are not to far from this violent entertainment. That is a scary thought! The Hunger Games is targeted for the Young Adult market, but the book is written for a mature reader. The control that the Capital has over the Districts mirrors our current government as they try to control the public. The book is violent, not graphic, but I would not recommend it to younger readers. I absolutely loved the book and I recommend it for older readers.
The premise of the books is fine. The present tense writing is pretty good. I liked all the characters, and even the bad guys didn't sound so bad, but possibly because I knew what was at stake for everyone. Even the government didn't seem so bad.  What I had a problem with was the tedious and boring description, right on into the end of the book. The scenes of her hunting and eating wild animal made me want to scream because the author covered those things for most of the book.  The most egregious about the writing was the flashback or paragraphs of description in the middle of action scenes that literally stopped the action.  Then the pages upon pages of description or character thoughts that bored me to death and did nothing but to fill the page because nothing was really happening. I particularly disliked the part when Katniss took us through many pages of how her sister, Prim, got a goat. I skipped all of that. There were many times when the description was merciless and boring and tedious that I skipped just to get to something that was happening.  The way this books is written, the actual Hunger Games in the book seems pretty boring! There were times where katniss was miraculously spared or saved by someone else instead of getting out of the situation by herself. That was annoying.  My other problem was the stereotype of the two black characters in the book, Thrash and Rue. In the author's attempt to portray them as sympathetic characters, she let lazying writing take over and start writing stereotypes of characters. Really, Thrash can't say two grammatically correct sentences! This goes to the stereotype of all blacks are uneducated. Rue who likes to swing in trees. I guess because all blacks are monkeys. The blacks in their district being whipped - like slaves, I guess. You wouldn't pick up on this SUBTLE stereotypes unless you've had to deal with them your whole life. There were others that I picked up on. Katniss is from an equally poor district, but she, Peeta, and Gale all speak perfectly well. Now, this might be intentional on the author's part and in later books we might find out that Rue's and Thrash's district is mistreated by the government and they have lesser education and are intentionally treated like second class citizens, then I can take the stereotypes, but if that's true then this is something that needs to be explained in THIS book and not a later books because right now the author looks like a lazy-writing, borderline racist fool in my eyes. Harsh, I know, but really.  Lastly, this book didn't compel me to want to read the other books in the series so I'm saying good-riddance to katniss and peeta and gale. The writing in this book was not that good and I can't take it for two more books.
I should first admit that I pride myself on usually avoiding what's popular when it comes to books. I don't like to read what everyone else is reading, but I gave into The Hunger Games because I got tired of everyone asking if I'd read it. It was definitely a quick read that I finished in about four days. I thought the build-up to the actual games was interesting, and once the games got started I was hooked. I haven't seen the movie, but I probably will now.  For those who bash the books for their brutality, this is one situation where you should really read the books for themselves.  The fight and "killing" scenes are not very descriptive - kids see worse on television. In fact, that was my main problem with the book - it's a bit too tween when it comes to details and is written in an extremely passive manner - "I did this. I went here. It was scary so I did this. I think this will happen next."  There are even long passages where nothing is happening at all, and Katniss (the lead female) even says the Capital will create mayhem just to push the players closer together in hopes of something happening. It definitely needed more mayhem.  While the reader is forced to ordeal pages and pages of a blossoming romance and Katniss cares for her injured counterpart, other players are being killed out of sight and we never get details about them at all. In fact, most of the 24 players remain nameless which is fine since it'd be difficult to keep up with them anyway.  The overall theme is what's more important. You have to appreciate what Collins has to say about war and starvation and the sad entertainment value of it all. Like the inhabitants of Panem, we are forced to listen to stories about war and dying every day.  You can't turn on the TV today and avoid it. It's been a part of everyday life of most of the teenagers who this book is targeted to since the day they were born. And just look at the billions we spend on the Olympics every four years! I totally got the author's intention here and it's the only reason I give this book 4 stars.  The book lost momentum for me after a while, but I did finish it.  The ending is predictable and a bit too cliche for me.  After I was done, I found I didn't really care about the characters and though I will probably read them, I had no immediate desire to pick up the next one. But it's easy to see why there is so much hype about this book today - for the good and bad reasons. And that's why I wanted to read it and you should too - find out and judge for yourself.
The premise: A sadly derivative attempt to cast Bachman's (King's) creepy and magnificentThe Long Walkinto the era of Reality TV; instead of getting voted off the island, they kill each other for the delight of the debauched viewers. Yawn. The protagonist is a teen girl (chick-lit... check) in a post-apocalyptic (future-fiction... check) world of oppression and want (depression-vibe... check) who feeds her family by hunting illegally (teen-empowerment, defiance, girl-power AND self-reliance... checkmate). It sounded like a rundown of current publishing trends - all that were missing were werewolves and tattoos. Wait - The Capital people all have tatts and body-mods. Sigh. Check. It seemed more formulaic than Tums and about as appealing.  I have rarely been more wrong, and more happy to BE wrong. Collins has a fresh and compelling voice and a brilliant sense of when and where to foreshadow or reveal. Some of the twists are a bit transparent, but the characters are rich and constantly evolve throughout the novel. Her use of the unexpected and the tight, taut pace she sets drags you into the world in a way few current authors manage. Her portrayals of Peeta and Gale skirt the edge of harlequin-hero but always veer sharply back to rock-solid character development just shy of it. These, along with Haymitch, are not flimsy set-piece guys for the teen-chick to pine over; they are as self-motivated and complex as Katniss herself - something exceedingly rare in books with teen female leads.  The heroine is complicated and compelling. The visually-rich landscape created in each scene is gripping and vivid - to the point I really hate that there is a movie coming to ruin my inner vision of Katniss' world. When I was within 500 Kindle locations (a few hours reading) of the end, I literally could not turn off the Kindle. I look forward to devouring the rest of the series (I am halfway through Catching Fire) and whatever new dish Collins cooks up for her next venture. I am confident it will be quite a ride.
I read some of the one-star reviews and I was absolutely compelled to write a review. Let me start by saying that I am the kind of person that, if you tell me a book or a movie is sooo good, that almost guarantees that I will probably never see it. And in the off chance that I do, it's been so built up in my mind that it could never live up to its expectations. I had that experience with this book (and the series) only something very strange happened. This book far exceeded my expectations! I was very reluctant to read it, given its celebrity status, but on the recommendation of a very trustworthy friend, I picked up The Hunger Games on a Friday and finished Mockingjay by the following Friday. Being a lover and a writer of fiction myself, I was engaged and moved at various points throughout these books. Some say that there is a back story missing, I have no idea where they are getting that from- most characters are developed to the point where you can actually see them while you are reading and form an emotional bond with them. I would absolutely say that this book is a perfect storm of 1984 and V for Vendetta (two works of art that I love!) and I have no reservations saying that.  I'm not going to get into the plot because I think the description of the story speaks for itself. But I do want to comment on those people who are criticizing Collins' grammar - see the beauty of a writer is that you are allowed to find your own voice and your own style. She has done that, beautifully might I add. I am actually a real stickler for grammatical errors and typos and they have actually been enough to make me put down a book, pick up a red pen and correct it myself. Collins' works are nothing like that, she has a style not unlike her contemporaries, and therefore there is something very familiar in the way that she tells the story.  If you take issue with these books, perhaps you should look within yourself  and ask "Am I a book snob?" If the answer is yes, then please, get over yourself and get lost in a wonderful work of fiction! It's there for your enjoyment, so please, enjoy!
The "Hunger Games" - reflects the current generation's love of reality shows - a la "Survivor," their "video game" mentality, and need for instant gratification, and blends it with classic dystopian novels: "Fahrenheit 451," "The Giver," "The House of the Scorpion," "1984," and arguably one of the best, "Brave New World."  So now what we have is a "new and improved" post-apocalyptic YA novel (I'll leave it to you if it is fiction or not). The novel is well developed; the plot is tense, gritty, and engrossing. Collins's characters are completely realistic and sympathetic as they form alliances and friendships in the face of overwhelming odds. Although we all can agree that the premise of the killings is somewhat objectionable and/ or disturbing; however, so was it in Jackson's "The Lottery" or the sexual relationships in Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale."  Still, without question, the book is very good; I would teach it in my junior or senior classes in a heartbeat! (That's a great way to ruin a good book!)    The "Hunger Games" - there is little left to say that has not already been said!  Being an English teacher (sorry about that), I have long been interesting in books that get students reading. In the late 90's, the "Harry Potter" series began to set the reading world on fire; I was enthralled with that series when I saw families carrying a Potter book and even talking about the book!  Some minor series followed onto the YA horizon, and then later came the "Twilight" series which got readers reading by moonlight. Now, it is the "Hunger Games" series which is sweeping the nation. Although I am not promoting "The Reading Games," just anything that promotes reading is good!    America has collapsed, weakened by drought, fire, famine, and war, to be replaced by Panem, a country divided into the Capitol and 12 districts. Each year, two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery (a tip of the hat to Shirley Jackson) to participate in The Hunger Games.  The Games are a mixture of entertainment, propaganda, and a form of mental intimidation of the subjugated districts; the televised games are broadcasted throughout Panem as the 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors, literally, with all citizens required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart, Peeta, the son of the town baker, will be pitted against bigger, stronger representatives. The pages turn faster as the book progresses. Sarah, a friend of mine, said it best: "I struggled to put this down. Though everyone told me how good it was, I just didn't expect to be as enthralled as I was."
The Positive:  This book incorporates a number of tropes from a number of very interesting previous works.  The game feels an awful lot like The Truman Show in its production and distribution.  Shirley Jackson's short story "The Lottery" seems to have inspired the selection process.  While this may seem a negative, it shows an ability for Collins to take used tropes and reinvent them for her own purposes.  The descriptive language is not overwrought and for the most part she avoids awkward societal elements that would come across as unbelievable.  It is daring in it's presentation of violence acted out by and acted upon adolescents.  The Negative:  The first, and perhaps the biggest flaw of this work, is that the daring presentation of violence acted out by and acted upon adolescents seems to lend itself more toward playing up the romantic aspects of the novel rather than focusing on the delivery of a deeper theme.  Though the main character talks much about the psychological and emotional aspects to the flawed societal construct, the author misses the opportunity to make the story a true commentary on human nature, and rather makes the story a commentary on the confused notions of adolescent romantic notions.  The book begins to bear a disturbing resemblance to Survivor, or Big Brother.  There are times when the story telegraphs too clearly coming plot twists.  There are changes in the game that feel like soft plot manipulation and the end of the story does an emotional hairpin turn that fails to provide a sense of cohesion between the ending of the story and the vast majority of its plot line.  In Closing:  A worth-while read with some minor flaws.  I'm looking forward to reading the next two in the series.
This book had me at: "When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold." This is a book I had meant to savor and read a bit each night, but the absolute phenomenal writing of Suzanne Collins would not allow me to do so. I read it in a day. On my birthday. My husband gave it to me as a gift before he left for work. Reading here and there, in between my celebrating, it was done with-in an hour of going to bed.  I love the strong female character that is Katniss. I love the uncertainty she has, the strength she displays, and her beauty of which she is unaware.  The book takes place in post-apocalyptic America.  The new country is divided into twelve districts with a capitol that lies somewhere in the Rockies. There was a 13th district but it was obliterated by the capitol in a show of force and a squashing of a rebellion. In order to keep a tight reign on the people of the twelve districts, the capitol keeps them hungry and afraid; by watching, listening, and rewarding informants. They also have a "game" (called "the Hunger Games") every year in which two children from each district must participate. It is a last man standing version of our "Survivor", minus the fancy rewards and immunity idols. Katniss is chosen to participate and we follow her in this game throughout the book.  I was struck afterwards thinking about our own reality shows and how far are we, really, from having a reality show like The Hunger Games? How far are we from allowing the government to monitor our every move, purchase, and thought? Our government already has a hand in our food supply allowing it to be genetically modified and adding chemicals to supposedly make it safer when all they really do is cause problems and side effects. Ok- enough of the soap box.  Read the book. Read the book especially if you are a fan of "The Walking Dead" television series, "The Road"The Road (Oprah's Book Club)a book by  Cormac McCarthy, and if you like "Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies".Call of Duty: Black Ops
I avoided reading "The Hunger Games" for so long because I had no desire to get all wrapped up in another popular mainstream trilogy. However, I finally caved in to peer pressure from my friends, and also figured I'd better read the book now before the film adaptation that's due out next year spoils the story for me. Well, I started reading the book last night and I just finished it today. It was one of those fabulous books that captivated me from page one all the way to the end...and I cannot wait to start reading the second book in the trilogy as soon as I am done writing this review!  "The Hunger Games" is set in what used to be North America. The world has gone to total hell, and the country of Panem consists of a wealthy Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts, many of which are in extreme poverty. This is not a democracy by any sense of the imagination. People struggle for food and the barest of necessities, and worry about getting in trouble (or killed) by the government over the stupidest things. District 12 is an especially poor area, and sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen risks her life every day illegally hunting for food to feed her mother and her younger sister. However, nothing Katniss has ever faced prepares her for the horrors that the Hunger Games have in store for her. Each year, the Capitol draws two childrens' names from each of the twelve districts. These young people, ranging in age from twelve to eighteen, are forced to participate in the Hunger Games...an event billed as a sort of Olympics by the Capitol but really just consists of two dozen kids being thrown into a horrible set of circumstances and forced to kill each other. Unfortunately, Katniss gets to experience all of this firsthand, and this book tells her story.  I couldn't put the book down. It is absolutely fabulous...very suspenseful and exciting. I haven't been this wrapped up in a book in a long time, and now all I can think about are these characters and what's going to happen to them in the next installment of the series.  One thing I will say is that although this is marketed as a book for young adults, it is SUPER intense and violent, so parents should definitely read it beforehand to see if it's suitable for their children. But, if your kid can handle the darker books in the Harry Potter series, they should have no problem with this.  Bottom line: get this book! Immediately! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start reading "Catching Fire."
Mel Gibson's third "Mad Max" movie threw the viewers into a post-apocalyptic gladiator duel and introduced the ominous cheer, "Two men enter, one man leaves!"  Suzanne Collins "The Hunger Games" takes that savage vision of the future one step further into deeper, darker territory.  Also set in a not-too-distant future, "The Hunger Games" takes place in a world recovering from civil war.  The victors, whose Capitol lies in the Rocky Mountains, keep the losing survivors under their thumb through a wicked combination of rigid economic controls, borderline starvation, and the Hunger Games.  The victors, flush with the spoils of war and living off the labors of the defeated, are a jaded bunch.  Their biggest thrill comes from watching a televised "most dangerous game" tournament where 24 "tributes," two teenagers from each of 12 districts of the defeated, fight to the death.  The Hunger Games, like The Long Walk, are a national obsession - like our "Survivor" on V (for the "True Blood" fans out there).  District 12's female tribute is Katniss Everdeen.  A lithe hunter but far from a juggernaut, Katniss has volunteered to save her family.  Once into the Games, Katniss is subjected to the tortures (both intentional and unintentional) of the Games.  For victory in the Games is not dependent solely upon your ability to survive, but also to win over the crowd as the viewers can participate in the Games by "sponsoring" contestants with vital gifts - from parcels of food and water to medicine and weapons.  For, as Katniss realizes as she fights for her life, the Games are not about her - they are about the viewers.  "The Hunger Games" is a book for our times.  It serves as a much-needed, powerful indictment of our culture of celebrity and voyeurship.  Given its dark plot, Collins has left the violence largely to the reader's imagination - despite some cruel moments, this is not a gruesome book that should be kept in the dark reaches of the bookstore.  Much darker than the "Percy Jackson" series, I grant you, but if you've got a kid who made it through "The Deathly Hallows" without nightmares, they'll do just fine with "The Hunger Games."
I both loved and hated this book.  I hated what it had to say about the depths of depravity to which humans are capable of sinking; but I loved it's representation of the individual's ability to overcome adversity.  This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time.  It's fast paced, with excellent narration that "rings true," even though it is set in a future dystopia.  The world of the Hunger Games is cast as "our" future, striking a perfect balance between the familiar and the alien.  The important characters are well developed, but the reader isn't beaten about the head and shoulders with long, pace-slowing narrative passages.  Ms Collins tells us what we need to know as we go, without resorting to the kinds of tricks lesser authors often use.  Peeta, the 16 year old protagonist, grabbed me in the first few pages with her direct, open style of narration.  She isn't a perfect character - she has her flaws - but the way she takes care of her little sister, ultimately offering her own life to save her, is more than just endearing.  The reader falls in love with her.  She is strong, smart, and amazingly capable, able to think like her opponents, but ultimately unable to read others' feelings for her.  This is not a fatal flaw, but it certainly does make her character more interesting!  Supporting characters are equally well crafted; each provided just enough back story to make them real enough for the story's purposes, and always from the limited perspective of the teen narrator.  None of the characters is a stereotype, and many of them turn out to be more - or less - than they seem.  The Hunger Games defies categorization.  Though it is labeled "young adult fiction," it has powerful appeal for older adults.  Typed as "science fiction" and "fantasy," it also fits into the "action/adventure" genre.  Some have even called it a "romance novel," though it would appeal to even the most romance-averse reader.  In short, Ms Collins seems to have created her own category.  The author doesn't preach to her audience, but this book has much to teach about the human condition.  I strongly recommend it for teens and adults, but would advise caution with children 12 and younger.  Some of the book's events are brutal and disturbing; possibly too disturbing for some children.  Read the book first, and ask yourself if your child is more like Peeta or Prim.  You will have your answer.
I was curious about this book as it appears to be the next "big" trilogy due to its being adapted into a movie (ala "Harry Potter" and "Twilight"). From reading about it, I was interested, but cautious, as its premise seems rather familiar to those who have read or seen the Japanese classic "Battle Royale," in which the government picks a group of school children to fight to the death as a way to keep the populace in line. "Hunger Games" has a very similar plot, taking place in a post global warming world where what is left of North America has been renamed and split into twelve (once thirteen) districts, who must submit a boy and girl to the annual fight to the death called The Hunger Games as a reminder for them not to try to rebel again.  Despite constantly reminding me of "Battle Royale," (and the movie of "A Clockwork Orange" with the weird Capitol outfits)the book did suck me in, and I very much wanted to keep reading. However, after thinking about it for a bit, I think it is more the ideas than the actual execution of the book that kept me interested. The writing itself is not very mature. It has many fragmented sentences that I would re-read, trying to find out where the rest of it was because it was incomplete. It is also written in the first person, which is currently very popular for young adult and fantasy/supernatural books whose intended audience is female. This first person account can be interesting, but is also one to be careful with- it is very easy to make the protagonist seem superficial and whiny to the point of annoyance. I didn't feel this too often about Katniss, except when it came to the relationship with Peeta. This relationship, which strengthened the book in some areas (especially at the end of the Hunger Games), also was one of the weakest areas. I wanted to roll my eyes every time Katniss would think about having to pretend "to be madly in love." It simply got old, and fast.  I do plan on reading the next two books because they are fun and the first ended in a place that really made me want to start the second right away. Yet, I hope that the actual writing gets better, so that Collins' ideas can be better expressed.
This book got so many good reviews, I couldn't ignore it anymore. For a long time, I tried resisting YA lit, but it's just so impossible. YA has so many amazing titles. This one is no exception, it was amazing. Disturbing, but amazing. As the beginning of a trilogy, this book does not disappoint. It does what the first book in a trilogy should do, make you want more. It's so fantastic, I spend a whole day reading it (from about 10%) and when it was over, I went to Amazon and bought the other two books in the trilogy and immediately started reading Catching Fire when it was delivered to my Kindle. It was that good. I've not done that in a very long time and I would venture to say that this book, The Hunger Games, is the best book I've read for leisure in a very long time. Okay, okay, so, enough gushing.  The crew:  The characters, I loved them. They're so believable, you can't help but love them--Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Primrose &amp; Rue, Thresh, Cinna &amp; Portia, even Effie and Haymitch!  Katniss Everdeen, the narrator, is a wonderful character. You don't always like her, or her choices, and there are moments when you'll want to scream at her to open her eyes and see what's right in front of her face. The fact that she doesn't always see what's right there, or the subtext going on between the other characters, is what makes her believable. It's what makes her human and likable. She has emotions and you see them clearly in her reactions to what's happening. Suzanne Collins is so good she makes the reader able to see things through Katniss's eyes, and from Katniss's perspective, that Katniss herself is missing. It takes one very capable author, with a clear understanding of what she's doing, to pull that off.  The other characters are all fantastic too, but I think I want to talk about Gale and Peeta here. In her interactions and relationships with Gale and Peeta, you can see that Katniss is very much a sixteen year old girls. She misses things, she makes assumptions that someone with more years wouldn't make, she suffers a great deal of conflict where these two guys are concerned. You can't help but root for her, and for them, even though she can't end up with both of them. You feel her attraction to Gale, even if she denies that there's anything romantic between them.  You feel her conflict about Peeta, the boy with the bread. I admit, though, that I love a good love triangle!  This is a good love triangle.  Both Peeta and Gale are desirable, in different ways, and in her feelings about them, the reader is almost as torn as Katniss herself.  The Story:  Okay, this is where the disturbing comes in. This story is dark. It's not for the faint of heart. It's about children (ages 12-18) killing one another. They're doing it for survival, and for the entertainment of the people in the Capitol of Panem. This is not a feel good, happy-go-lucky book. It's a live or die book. There are some reviewers on Goodreads who took strenuous objection to the whole kids killing kids thing, and while it's very poignant, I agree that it's difficult to stomach. What I don't agree with is that this book should be skipped. This book is great, the setting is dark, but that's what makes it good literature. It has a point. The setting is very well thought out, the actions and reactions are very clear and often unsettling. You see why they're doing it, how it's received in the Districts, and the difference between the people dying to survive in the Districts from those in the Capitol, where there's wealth. This is dystopian and dystopian is not always pretty. As a matter of fact, it's never pretty. That's what makes dystopian what it is. It always has a point. Always. I suppose it comes down to this: If you can't stomach kids killing kids, don't read it. Otherwise, try.  The Verdict:  I loved it and recommend it to anyone.  Not just anyone who enjoys dystopian, but to everyone. I don't generally read dystopian and I loved this book. If you've been on the fence, and think you can deal with the unsettling themes, go get it.  You won't regret it.
Below is an excerpt of my full review of The Hunger Games trilogy:  Grim only begins to describe the life people live in the districts. Some people are better off than others, but deaths caused by starvation are regularly occurring events, stealing or going outside the district's fence results in death, and a boy and a girl from ages 12 to 18 are selected for events where the more brutality involved, the more entertaining the event for its viewers. Flip to Capitol life and people live an exotic life of luxury with capable technology reminiscent of Star Trek: The Next Generation. The most entertaining part was definitely during two of The Hunger Games and the assault on the Capitol late in Mockingjay. I kept wondering how Catching Fire would end and was treated to something pleasantly unexpected. When things are looking bad near the end of Mockingjay, the unrestrained inhumanity of a few strikes a devastating blow that are a bit mind blowing.  Mockingjay`s ending was pretty good, but it felt a little rushed. Without revealing too much, I think that Collins could have incorporated the last major event a bit better in earlier chapters rather than have it come up at the end of one of the final ones. It caused quite a stir given what followed, but bits and pieces could have made it more of a guessing game throughout the final book. I suppose that is where young adult fiction separates itself from adult fiction, maintaining a slightly devious plot rather than one with many twists and turns. The love triangle felt a little weak at times due to Katniss' ineptitude towards romance for either character that were vying for her affection. It did not help that Katniss, who has zero experience with romance, instantly turned into an A class actor by being a star struck lover with Peeta. Most of the interaction was not bad because it did not feel like petty teenage drama, but Katniss could deliver when there was a crowd, yet not when it really mattered in terms of the love story.  The Hunger Games trilogy is very entertaining and I can easily see why it is so popular. I did not care for the entire series being in the first person from beginning to end, so with the movie that will soon be produced, I hope they are not bogged down by the love story and Katniss only and instead give more spotlight time to other characters that had a hand in propelling the books forward, like Rue, Haymitch, Finnick, Beetee, Coin and even President Snow.
It's taken a little longer to post this review than I expected it would.  That's mainly because I wasn't able to stop after reading Suzanne Collins' first novel in this series.  "The Hunger Games" is the first in the trilogy that carries over into "Catching Fire" and "Mockingjay".  It's the story of Katniss Everdeen, a seventeen year old girl who becomes a tribute in the Hunger Games, a twisted gladiatorial competition in which two tributes from each of Panem's twelve districts are forced to participate.  It is an annually televised "reality show" wherein the twenty-four tributes are forced to battle each other to the death in an acres-wide arena filled with deadly terrain, genetically engineered flora and fauna, and mobile traps designed to move the action along for the viewers when things get too boring.  The setting is a dystopian future in which global warming and wars have decimated much of the world, and a corrupt government has taken its lessons from ancient Rome - distract the populace with enough blood to entertain them, and remind them of who's in charge.  At the same time, keep them impoverished and oppressed, convinced that they're lucky to receive the dregs left behind by the Capital.  By the end of the first book, Katniss realizes that she's become a pawn in a plot that is much larger than the Games.  She learns to play for the cameras, and the hearts of the viewers, and through them, perhaps change the very fabric of her society.  I won't give spoilers here, but I will say that even though the story is written as a young adult novel, it is darker than most YA fiction I've read, and entertaining enough to keep this fifty year old kid engaged.  It alternates between multilayered plotlines that are in places rather simplistic, and in others quite thought-provoking.  Since this review is specifically for the first book, "The Hunger Games", I won't go into the other two books in the trilogy.  I couldn't do so anyway without spoiling some of the plotlines of the first book.  All I will say is that Suzanne Collins is an author I will be supporting by buying more of her work.  I highly recommend this entire series.  I give it four out of five stars.
As I write this review there are now 1,756 reviews already posted; which is a lot of reviews when you think about it.  I seriously doubt if I will be able to add one thing in my little effusion here that has not already been said but since it will soon be buried and will probably never be read by another human I suppose that will not matter much.  Anyway....  I have to tell you that like many folks here I was absolutely hooked on the first page and went through torment when I had to put the thing down in order to eat several times and to sleep once.  I cannot remember when a book captivated me so.  The plot has been given a pretty well going over here so I will not dwell on that much.  The story, as told through the words of a young girl, takes place in a future totalitarian society; America, after things have gone horribly wrong.  There is a place called the Capitol which pretty well runs everything and the country has been broken up into twelve districts (There is a thirteenth district but in this book it has been supposedly completely obliterated.)  Because these districts had, 75 years ago rebelled against the Capital, they are required to give up two of the children each year, a boy and a girl.  These kids are taken to an arena and forced to fight to the death until only one is left. The people in each of these districts are treated like slaves and for the most part are simply starved or worked to death in the end.  That in brief, is the essence of the story.  Is this somewhat brutal?  You bet it is.  Is this somewhat horrifying?  Most certainly.  Is the story plot realistic?  Unfortunately, yes it is...quite believable.  And this is why so many are reading this work and the two books that follow in this series.  The author has done her job.  Most of us are horrified and most of us do see the brutality in the situation and most of us deplore it.  To be quite frank, I would quite worry about someone who was not horrified and a bit disturbed.  I have some random thoughts about this book:  The writing is good.  We are not talking high literature here, and thank goodness for that.  We are talking about a well written story that, after reading the many reviews here and on other sites, holds the readers interest page after page. Excellent plot, excellent dialog, lots of action, very fine character development...it is all here.  Maybe it is not to everyone's taste, but it most certainly satisfies the reading needs of a lot of folks...both young and old.  The premise of this story is certainly not new.  Right off the top of my head I think of the old story "The Lottery," and a more recent novel by Stephen King, "The Long Walk."  Both are similar but this idea is no worse the wear for being used again and I really think this author got it better than King did with his shot at it.  Designating this work as a YA book is really a bit inaccurate as the age group who will enjoy this thing has a very wide range and in many ways the book is more suited for the adult reader than the pre-teen.  I personally would have no problem with a younger child reading this thing, but each child is so different that this would be a hard call to make.  I do have a great problem with those folks who seem to want to ban this work from school libraries...that is one of the silliest things I have ever heard of.  Folks who want this have no clue as to what their children are reading right now.  I recently read three YA books by different authors.  In those three books there were vivid descriptions of vampires sucking the blood out of the necks of virgins, (and a goodly number of non-virgins), blatant and casual recreational drug use, sex, group sex (a cool thing to do, by the way), gang rape (no big deal), infidelity, murder, robbery....oh where to stop?  I can assure you that none of these subjects were addressed in this book.  No folks, our libraries are no longer filled with `Little House in the Big Woods' books...it is more like `Little Meth House in the Big Woods'...truth be told.  The concept of having a drawing to decide which child (ages 12 through 18) be sent off to fight to the death is upsetting to be sure.  On the other hand, does anyone here remember a thing called The Draft?  We have been sending children, and make no mistake, an 18 year old is still something of a child, off to fight and die in wars since the beginning of so called civilization.  This concept of not putting children in harms way has never held much water.  During most of our previous wars we had children, young men, as young as 15 fighting and dying in them.  The author has done a very nice job with the violent scenes.  They are well done, not gratuitous in the least bit, are an important part of the story  and not overly graphic when compared to a lot of books that are on our shelves today.  Taste in books is wide ranging.  This book will not be for everyone.  I personally found in one of the better reads I have had over the past ten years are so and am already on the third volume of this series and dread that it will soon be over.

Dystopia, Big Brother and post-apocalypse are themes that have been included in novels so often that it could well  be a life's work for a librarian to prepare an exhaustive catalogue of titles. But, in terms of quality, the devil is in the details and Suzanne Collins has justifiably taken the world by storm. Her novel, THE HUNGER GAMES, inspired by the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur, is an innovative, dare I say unique, young adult twist on the recurring themes of violence, cruely, despair, privation and revolution that are the mainstays of these types of novels.  A distant future North America, now called Panem, is divided into 12 distinct economic districts ruled with an iron fist from the Capitol located in the northwest Rocky Mountain region of the former USA. Every year, in a bizarre celebration called "The Reaping", the Capital "honours" each district by selecting two children that will be called "tributes", one boy and one girl, to participate in THE HUNGER GAMES. The 24 children are released into a wilderness arena and are expected not only to survive but to battle one another to the death. The last remaining child is returned to his or her district as a conquering hero.  The games, reminiscent of Rome's bloodthirsty gladiatoral combats,  are televised as an extravaganza throughout Panem on a minute by minute basis. Carefully engineered from start to finish, the sculpted terrain of the "arena" might be anything from arctic or forest to desert or rugged mountains; an unknown supply of weapons and supplies are provided but will have to be fought for and "won" as part of the entertainment; the games are replete with intermittent technologically engineered disasters such as fires, teeming rainstorms or earthquakes; genetically engineered humans or animals called "muttations" are periodically released to provide extra challenge for the tributes or extra entertainment for the viewing audience.  Of course, the entire affair is intended to serve notice to Panem of the continuing absolute authority of the Capitol over the Districts. But somehow, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the tributes from District 12 and the perennial underdogs of the Games, unwittingly create an untenable political embarrassment for the Capitol and the engineers running the Games by doing nothing more than remaining true to themselves, their friends and family, to each other and to their values. By thinking and reacting in an unprecedented and entirely unpredictable way, Katniss and Peeta create the first small kernels and the obvious foreshadowing of a rebellion to come.  Katniss and Peeta are truly intelligent, well-crafted, complex, memorable characters displaying the love, friendship, loyalty, courage, innovation and independence that contrast obviously with the much darker themes so typical of other dystopian novels that we're more familiar with. Suzanne Collins has crafted a winning page-turner that will pull you in, quickly and deeply. Like everyone in Panem, you'll find yourself riveted to the pages rooting for Katniss' and Peeta's survival and biting your fingernails with worry over every obstacle they encounter. Then even if they both survive the predations of the other 22 competitors, how will they deal with the requirement to ultimately battle one another to the death to provide the Games with a single surviving winner?  THE HUNGER GAMES was focused on world-building and action. But my expectation is that the subsequent instalments in the trilogy, CATCHING FIRE and THE MOCKINGJAY, will focus more on the cerebral themes of politics and revolution. And, frankly, I can't wait to get to them! Highly recommended.  Paul Weiss
A group of twenty-four teenagers battle it out until death, the last one alive is the winner. This hideous, so called game, held yearly, is the Capitol's way of making sure they have total control over their twelve districts. Sound like a good book? Millions of teenagers and adults alike all over the nation seem to think so. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is a spectacular action story for young adults, with themes about survival love, cleverly told in first person, which keeps you turning the pages until the last one. The book is fast, intense, and full of action.    While reading The Hunger Games, one is absorbed by the story. The main character Katniss Everdeen, is someone that you don't find endearing at the beginning of the book, but you find yourself rooting for her anyway. The descriptive and engaging writing style helps to create the complex and suspenseful plot.  Though some parts are vague and leave you in the dark, and even though the story is not totally realistic, most of the book is well explained and interesting,    One of the best parts of the book is that the idea is so original. The theme of survival has of course been used in various books. However, this particular book is like nothing you have read before because of things like the teen violence and heroism. The idea of writing in first person is also a good way to write an action book, and leaves you, again, with the impression of originality.    Being overall a good read, The Hunger Games does have a few downsides. Having the book told in first person generally works, but when Katniss has flash backs, and when she tells about her government and such, it gets a bit hazy and you find yourself wanting a better mental picture. Another downside of the book is that in several places, it leads you on to something that  never happens, like when the book talks in detail about Mockingjays, but then finishes up abruptly, with no final explanation. It is frustrating and pointless, and you end up confused. It could be that the author is setting up the sequel, however this should not have to be done at the expense of the first book as is done here.    I would recommend this book to other young adults because it is well written and the story is captivating. There are several things that are obnoxious, such as the leading on and flashbacks, but for the most part, this is a fun, exciting, engaging book. Most people will enjoy this, and not only is this a personal opinion, but by the sales of this  book, I think most would agree, The Hunger Games, is a very good read.
The Hunger Games is book 1 in a YA trilogy written by Suzanne Collins.  It is a dystopian story written about future North America after floods, war and famine.  The continent is changed into one large super country called Panem that is made up of a large capital and 13 districts, each in a different area that produces a different resource used by the government to control all of the other districts.  There was a rebellion in the history of Panem in which district 13 was completely destroyed, leaving 12 districts in fear of what could happen to them at any moment.  Katniss Everdeen is a 16 yr old girl that lives in district 12, the coal district.  She has lived a hard life in the harshest district.  Katniss lived through her father dying in a mine explosion and her mother turning catatonic after that while she still had a younger sister, Prim, to take care of.  The worst is not even close to over to Katniss, though.  The day of the reaping is coming.  This is where the Capital chooses one boy, 18 and under, and one girl to become the Tributes from each district and these children must fight to the death in a man made arena.  The sole survivor is crowned victor and lavished with gifts and food and a new home and their district is given food and oil for the entire year until the next reaping.  Whose name gets called out at the reaping?  You'll have to read to find out in this electrifying novel that kept me turning pages from beginning to end.  Suzanne Collins take a subject (children being required to kill to survive) that could be so repulsive and turns it into a heart stopping story where you can truly love the good guys and they choose to do what's right and good even in the worst of circumstances.  This book is very well written and there is great development to the characters and relationships.  I look forard to reading Catching Fire and Mockingjay, (books 2 and 3).  I already own both and will start them immediately!  So far this series tops my list of favorite YA books.  Of course this trilogy is not suited for everyone.  It is very dark and there are killings and fighting.  Nothing extremely graphic, but enough that you get a really good picture in your head.  I MUCH prefer this over the usual YA fare of romantic mush and teenage drama.  Katniss is a perfect protagonist.  She is incredibly smart and strong, very able bodied and doesn't let her emotions rule her.  She has solid relationships and keeps herself in check.  I love that Katniss is responsible, not just out of obligation but out of love for her sister and out of a knowledge that she must do what's right and what needs to be done.  I highly recommend the Hunger Games to any dystopian fans or to anyone looking for something new and exciting to read.  The good news is the 3rd book was released in August so you can read the entire trilogy at once with no waiting!
For starters, I love dystopian science fiction stories.  I'm a big fan of novels likeMake Room! Make Room!(a.k.a.Soylent Green) and the writings of Philip K. Dick.  In that sense, I knew I was going to like The Hunger Games from the get go.  The premise: America has been ravaged by war and the remaining survivors are clustered into twelve districts.  Life is hard in (most of) the districts, and if you're lucky you might earn enough through the year to be feed your family. Each year, two teenagers from each district are conscripted into a televised death match where the winner walks away with a lifetime of food and shelter provided by the central government.  The writing is simple, overly so at times.  Ms. Collins feels the need to explain how things got to be the way they are instead of leaving it up to the reader to surmise.  Then again, it's marketed as a "teen" novel, so perhaps the level of detail is necessary for its target audience.  There is a fair amount of violence in the novel, although nothing you wouldn't find in a PG-13 movie.  I appreciated the fact that there's no course language, which is something that many "adult" novels could take a cue from.  The pacing of the novel is just right, with the occasional twist presented at the right moment.  One exception was where the Gamemakers announce a change in the rules during the game; it was too predictable, and I had to set the book down in disgust for a few hours.  In general, though, I read the book every chance I could get.  I would wake up early just so I could get an extra chapter in.  At 374 pages the book is long enough to present a well-rounded tale.  If anything, I would have enjoyed a longer book, and the teaser at the end alludes that another book is in the works.  I'm intrigued enough to look for the next book in the series when it comes out.
Set in a futuristic anti-America known as Panem, a repressive regime in which the ruling Capitol elite control twelve districts of commoners, The Hunger Games recounts the savage ordeal experienced by sixteen-year old narrator Katniss Everdeen.  As an annual showing of control, the Capitol forces twenty-four randomly-selected teenage representatives of the districts to fight to the death in an amped-up Survivor environment, their struggles broadcast live to a rabid Panem-wide audience.  Katniss, who has honed her bow hunting and survival skills in fending for her fatherless family, becomes an unlikely favorite in the contest.  But when her male counterpart in district twelve professes his love for her (either as a ploy or from the heart), Katniss is torn between her individual survival instincts, her unexpected tenderness toward some of her competitors, and the need to put on a romantic show that will please the Capitol and viewing audience.  Although the future world of Panem is rather thinly sketched and the Capitol's motive for the Hunger Games is rather hard to take at face value, Katniss narrates with a compelling voice that hooked me from page one.  The prose is so crisp, clean and utterly addictive that the words seemed to drip right into my veins, with just enough plot twists to keep me a little off balance. In this way, Suzanne Collins had me turning pages late into the night, unable to wait to see how the rebellious Katniss would fare in this brutal contest.  Besides generating first-rate suspense, building to a wicked climax, Suzanne Collins uses a classic prisoners-dilemma structure to probe a variety of morality-based themes.  Billed as young-adult fiction, this first book launches an exciting trilogy that is sure to satisfy us older readers as well.
The Hunger Game by Suzanne Collins is a dystopian novel, set in a not too distant future, with elements of steam punk and reality television.  Katniss Edreen is a survivor who, out of love for her little sister, volunteers for a deadly game in which she will have to literally fight for her life against twenty-three other competitors.  The winner will win glory, wealth, and benefit their entire community.  And live.  The truth is, as much as I love dystopian novels, I resisted this young adult novel because it sounded derivative ofBattle Royale Directors Cutand I didn't trust Collins to write something that wouldn't constantly remind me of that movie.  While there are parts that are similar, they are hardly worth mentioning because this book had me hooked from the second chapter.  I knew I was hooked because I started to get tears in my eyes.  How many sci-fi novels have I read and found banal with their predictability?  How many young adult novels have I accused of being insulting to readers?  I can't even begin to count.  Collins has managed to create dynamic characters who continuously surprise as the plot twists and turns until the reader is bound to return to read again, to pick up on the more subtle points that may have been overlooked on the first compulsive reading.  I could not put this book down!  However, about halfway through part three of the novel it hit me--this book has to be part one of a series.  I tried to slow down my progress because there is nothing I find more frustrating than finishing the first in a series of books that hasn't been completely published.  As the novel wrapped up the major threads of the story, there were some obvious plot points that were not being explored to conclusion.  And sure enough, when I reached the last page, there were the dreaded words:  End of Book One.  ARGH!  Why why why?  I want to know what happens next to Katniss.  I want to know more about the implications of what was revealed in chapter 25.  I want to know more now!  But the second book is still out there in not-yet-published limbo.  I can only appease my own hunger for more by reading her other books, beginning withGregor The Overlander (Underland Chronicles).  I had never heard of them or Collins before and now all I can say is directed at the author herself.  If you need anyone to proofread the manuscript for book two, please feel free to email me; I would be more than happy to do so.
I picked this up when my son was reading it for school. I barely put it down over the next few days. I had already seen the movie, but reading the book was awesome - getting to see what was going on in their minds. Loved it and starting the next
So I knew the book was going to be good, but I had no idea it was going to be this good. A piece of advice: try and have the second book ready whilst you're reading this, because even if you think you'd be able to wait or spread your reading, you won't be able to.  Set in what used to be North America, a new world order is created. The Capitol Panem rules its 12 districts ruthlessly. Each district is famous for something: fish, crops, electronic devices, etc. District 12, where the protagonist Katniss is from, produces coal.  Katniss hunts illegally in the woods behind District 12 to earn money and find food for her family. At 16, she takes care of her mother and younger sister and has been doing so ever since her father died a couple of years ago. She learned almost everything she knows about hunting from her father and her friend Gale, whom she met in the woods one day.  Panem devised a plan, or punishment for the districts when they rebelled 70+ years ago. The Hunger Games were put into motion and in these games, 2 tributes (a male and a female) from each district were chosen randomly and made to participate in the event at Panem. In the games, the tributes were ordered to kill each other until a lone survivor remains. The age group for the tributes had to be between 12 and 18.  Not only could the people of the districts not complain about the unfairness of the games, and the killings of children, but they had to celebrate the games and be jolly about it. On the 74th year, Katniss is the female tribute from District 12 and is sent to Panem along with the male tribute, Peeta, a fellow classmate that she barely knows but is indebted to because of his help when they were kids.  "
Panem is a world built on the remains of our present, and is divided into twelve districts controlled by the Capitol. Once the districts rebelled against the Capitol but they lost the war. The way found by the Capitol to punish the rebels was to destroy one of the districts and organise "The Hunger Games": every year each district has to send a boy and a girl - the tributes - to an arena to fight to death against the tributes of the other districts. Katniss volunteers to the games to take the place of her younger sister and Peeta, the son of the baker, is randomly chosen to pair up with Katniss as the tributes of District 12. The whole thing is televised as a huge reality TV show and humanity seems completely lost for those who bet on the children and are thrilled by each death.  This has to be one of the fastest paced books I have ever read. It is amazingly well written! This book is the first of a trilogy so I knew the end would be a cliffhanger to make me run for the second book (Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)). It is surprising how I loved Katniss although her main instinct is to survive to get back to sister, even if it means killing everything that moves and compromising her feelings. The easy to love Peeta shows the tenderness that seems to have abandoned everyone else as he doesn't mind losing, which means being killed, if that makes Katniss the winner. Reading the way characters grow while fighting for survival and finding surprising allies is extremely enjoyable. The whole Panem is exceptionally well thought and this book is a pleasure to read, even if the whole idea of children killing each other sounds like a awful premise. A must read.
I'm a huge fan of the Hunger Games. Then again, that doesn't make me special because everyone is. I get why people love this book and I'm glad I read it. It really stuck with me for a few days and I don't know what to expect in the next two books.  Let's start with Katniss. She's cold and calculating and she's a survivor. She's everything you want in a heroine. At the same time, she's frustrating. She's not exactly what I would look for in a girlfriend. She's manipulative and always has survival in the back of her mind. Just ask Peeta and Gale.  The surprise standout to me was Cinna. I've been seeing pictures of Lenny Kravitz and I tried to divorce myself form his image while I read the book. I didn't have to work very hard. Cinna is a character all his own and I think he's sort of the dark house candidate for best character in the book. He's a nice mix of sensitive and revolutionary. I don't think anyone in the capitol understands Katniss better than Cinna.  I wasn't a huge fan of Peeta. I thought he was oafish and dramatic. His relationship with Katniss is a fine example of gender reversal and their dynamic is fascinating. Their relationship is painful.  I admit, I wasn't sure how it would end. Collins kept me guessing. It was fairly obvious that she wasn't going to die, as Jennifer Lawrence has signed on for the entire franchise, but I really couldn't figure out how things would ultimately turn out.  This book is worthy of all the hype and it exceeded my expectations. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy, and even more excited to see the movie in a few weeks.  I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
I wasn't sure I would like this book which had been recommended by my family.  It's not the kind of book I usually read.  I found it fascinating and difficult to put down.  I am now looking forward to reading the other two books in the trilogy.
I gave the Hunger Games five stars because I feel it was well written. Each and every chapter compelled me to continue on to the next chapter to see what happened. It has been a long time since I have read a book that held my interest that way.
Loved the story. It was so suspenseful and dramatic. The way true love mixed in with violence and  tragic events was amazing. Suzanne Collins  splashed in sadness where the story needed it. Look forward to reading the next hunger games book :-)
The book was really good and delivered quickly to my Kindle.  I was barely able to put this book down for a second after the first few pages got me completely hooked and ended up buying the rest of the series two days later to see how it ended.
If you took the Vietnam War and mixed it with Stephen King (or Richard Bachman)'s "The Running Man," you would get "The Hunger Games," a brilliant novel that has such a gruesome concept during a time period in which such a thing is taken very seriously.  In this new utopia, a revolt in Panem, an area in North America, leads to the government creating an annual event known as "The Hunger Games." Here, a male and female teenager from each of the twelve districts are forced as tributes by random draw in order to compete in a competition in which they have to kill one another until only one is left standing. The last one standing wins food and supplies for themselves and their district. Katniss Everdeen, a tough girl and leader of her family from District 12, offers herself as a tribute in place of her sister Prim. From there, she creates relationships with people such as Peeta from her district and Rue from District 11. It all leads to an exciting adventure in which young people have to pay for deeds in which the old people failed to resolve.  It is just incredible how honest this novel is with a dark option for what the future could possibly bring. It's especially incredible how there is plenty of poking at the habits of the media. Before the actual games, the contestants are treated as celebrities, looking pretty and being told what to do by producers, but for many of them are heading to their death sentences.  The elements to this novel were just awesome and if this novel was extended a little bit longer, there would have been no need for the rest of the trilogy. Just an awesome piece of young adult fiction, a very hardcore piece of young adult fiction.
I read the trilogy a couple of years ago but waited until now to write the review after I had digested it all.  Teenagers/children are put up for sacrifice.  Many books follow this premise.  This, however, is the future with all the killing to come being televised live and some of the protagonists are not even in their teens.  The setting is created by the leaders of the empire following a scourge after a nuclear war.  It is a little like "The Truman Show" except the recording of their experience is exposed to the participants - well most of it is except the staged effects to come.  They know they are in it to kill one another in order to come out alive.  I read this book with my heart in my mouth, not really keen on a book that was like a computer game where killing could be shown carelessly.  It wasn't, but it still felt voyeuristic and fear-inducing.  That 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen is shown to have heart and compassion in all this, and is rarely showed to be a murderer is extraordinary, and believable.  Throughout I wondered how the author would pull off a convincing heroine who at the same time has to murder her peers.  That she has done so is a piece of excellent plotting.  You like Katniss for her courage, her humanness and her humanity.  She is attractive but unaware of it - she knows it doesn't matter what she looks like when she is like putty in the hands of the empire; they are out to get her and her competitors killed as a show of their dominance in the face of potential rebellions like the last one.  Best of all, I liked Katniss for her rebelliousness.  The twist at the end made the whole thing worthwhile.  It wasn't an easy read by any means. But I recommend it.
This book I rate FIVE stars because she leads you farther into the book and keeps you on the edge of your seat even if  you have seen the movie.  If you seen the movie or have not read the book.  I would recommend this book for 11 or 10 and up
Let me begin by saying that Hunger Games is a commercial success by every standard of measure. In that sense, the author deserves full credit.  However, if I were to critically evaluate it, I'd say the book should come with something of a warning to the general public.  Hunger Games has a mixed genre and seems unsure whether it wants to be a romance novel or a serious work of science fiction.  The result is less than optimal.  Collins does a superb job of writing in first person, which is not an easy thing to do. This gives the book a great pace that keeps the pages flipping.  The story itself is somewhat contrived but it still entertains. I won't add spoilers, but let's just say Hunger Games is something like a blend between Brave New World and the typical romance novel. Starting out, the book is more sci-fi than romance novel but Collins doesn't seem to be able to resist the itch for long. Soon you're treated to pages of those knowing moments where one glance into his eyes lasts an eternity and it takes a paragraph just to describe a kiss. Of course, you also get the typical love triangle schlock where Katniss is tormented trying to decide which man she really loves.  The main character, Katniss, is very interesting (despite her bizarre, silly name) and it's fun watching her plotting and calculating her way through the games.  Her boyfriend may be wimpy, but Katniss is still interesting to track.  Sure there are plenty of girly moments, lots of descriptions of dresses, hairdos, and make-up, but then you're back to the action sequences which are entertaining and keep the story moving.  In the end, I admire Collins talent to sell an astronomical number books but still I'm left wanting.  Had she leaned harder to the sci-fi side the book would have had had an enduring legacy.  Instead she'll score with then teen females while leaving the broader audience waiting something else.  Hunger Games is readable but I don't think it will last the test of time.
I don't normally read fiction, let alone teen-fiction, but I made a trade with my wife to read it if she would read one of my books. I enjoyed the book and read in less than 2 days. I'm also not American so take the comments on America with a pinch of salt.  The book sketched a post apocalyptic future of America after another massive civil war, and a communist style peasant uprising that was brutally crushed by the ruling powers. In part the story was a retelling of Ancient Rome's story with America as the new Roman Empire. Kinda hard to miss that with characters like Flavius, Octavius, and Caesar. The hunger games themselves are the Colosseum, with the live TV audience watching and hoping for blood. Certain parts of the games were mandatory to watch but perhaps the society had become so passe towards killing that it was just considered good TV?  There are so many political comments in the book that take stabs at current American politics. The poor education they receive in district 12 - read bad American public schools. And the anthem that continually plays and the law being read out? Star spangled banner and pledge of allegiance anyone? The huge divide between rich and poor districts - read Beverly hills vs Harlem or a small town in the heartland. There is also the huge emphasis on reality TV, media and cameras everywhere filming the entire thing. I don't like reality TV shows but is this where they will end up in the future after we're bored with the Kardashians?  The novel was also hugely influence by two seminal works: Orwell's "1984" and Huxley's "Brave new world". In fact the society of 12 districts is kept in check by both prevailing metaphors. The Capitol and the richer districts are kept in check by their narcissism, entertainment and riches. They are so preoccupied with looking better, celebrities and the spotlight that they fail to see the horror of the games. People are killing others on live TV! I guess you give them what they want and they quickly sacrifice their freedom. Even those closest to Katniss in the Capitol (i.e. Cinna) hold their tongues and speak codedly when she wins. The lower and poorer districts are kept in check by force and coercion. I was impressed by the kind of subject matter the author tried to deliver to a teenage audience.  But I have some reservations. Firstly the story if written in the present tense, which I found odd. It read like a screenplay with directions for actors as opposed to a real story, which would normally be in the past tense. It made it hard to get a sense of the time that had passed. Secondly, I think the book played right into the current teenage culture of suspicion, revenge, and anti-authority. And without offering it any sort of critique or alternative vision. The hero is overly suspicious of love, even when it stares her in the face. I understand how she came to be that way, but the author didn't hold out much hope for her changing. She is skeptical of marriage, and blatantly against bringing children into the world. Although scarred from a bad past, I felt it didn't fit with her character. The heroes are also dead set on showing the authorities that they are not under their control. That they are their own people, the captains of their own destinies. What teen isn't? But killing yourself to show them up? Come on. The author condones their actions as heroic, if they take our lives they can't take our freedom? There is no sense to their sacrifice, no hope that it will bring down the system. It's just ill-thought out teenage angst. Should all teens do this to stick it to the man? I'd rather see Teens stand up and say I'm going to fight to defend my right to freedom, rather than kill themselves to make a statement. Suicide is cowardly.  With that in mind I gave the book 2 stars. It's OK, nothing ground-shaking, and would make a decent movie. I just hope teens are smart enough not to uncritically swallow the philosophy behind the book.
There is nothing really wrong with this book.  Like, I mean, its not like I was really offended by it or anything.  I mean, Collins is a passable writer, she definitely had a vision, she took her characters where she wanted to go and she followed her theme through to the end.  But for me, the story rang hollow.  There was nothing to it.  The characters were shallow, uninteresting, and for the most part, blandly generic.  We are told who they are more than shown.  Katniss is not necessarily annoying, but her character is not really compelling.  We are told she is, we are told that people like her, we are told that she forms relationships, but never do we get any evidence besides the author directly speaking to us to prove that she is any of those things.  She is a character I have read before, blending into the likes of many other YA female protagonists.  I found it difficult to find her relationships believable.  I mean, she tells us she loves her sister, but their interactions are small enough that I am forced to take the authors word for it.  The same goes for the "love triangle."  Her interactions and thoughts about Gale are stale and limited enough that I found myself baffled as to why Collins thought her readers would think there was anything more there than bland friendship.  And Peeta is a tool.  He is the vessel through which the reader is supposed to see Katniss's character, and understand that she really is a cool person who is loved and respected by a lot of people.  It felt too contrived, to forced.  And the story was predictable.  I could predict most of the main plot points from how the games were going to go, to how the love story was going to go.  It was all very paint-by-numbers to me.  I think for me the hardest part was being made to feel like I had to feel a certain way.  Like, the Capital is mean because Katniss says it is, and also, they do mean things.  Like, these mean evil games.  And like, Rue is a cool person because she reminds Katniss of her sister, who we are told is a cool person.  And like, Peeta is a nice person, because Katniss says he is.  And also, like, he loves her an stuff.  And of course, Katniss is super talented and smart and such, and also she can make people like her because she has a spark or something.  Which of course, being humble and such, she does not see.  I guess in the end, it could have been a compelling story, and I think that Collins really had a good idea.  Even her characters could have had potential, and in the hands of another author, maybe a truly gripping story would have been produced.  But as it stands, I see no need to read the other two stories.  The Wikipedia summaries are enough for me--especially as they confirm my predictions.
The Hunger Games kept appearing in my recommendations every time I logged onto my Amazon account and always I blew it off. I had read the synopsis but thought it just wouldn't be my thing. One day, on a whim, I decided to give it a try and though it is (as I knew it would be) pretty violent, it is also a wonderful book. I found myself still feeling like I was in the arena with Katniss long after the book ended, its message still feeling so tangible. All I can say is, I wish I had read this series sooner!  16 year old Katniss Everdeen, an expert (illegal) hunter from District 12 lives in a bleak version of a country that used to be the United States, now known as Panem. Spending her days sneaking under the fence that surrounds her district to hunt with her best friend Gale, Katniss provides her family with desperately needed food and is more like a mother to her younger sister Prim after her father died and her mother is a shell of her former self.  In this futuristic world, the government has absolute control over its citizens, including what food they can eat and what jobs they can have. The country is divided into 12 districts all with their own 'duties' for the government such as the fishing district, the technology district, and the coal district, District 12. The people of the districts live in poverty and their world feels more like the time of the early industrial revolution mixed with oppressed Europe where people were first and foremost, laborers.  The citizens of Panem grow up in a world where starvation is a regular occurrence and talk against the government is punishable by death. Every year, the government forces all the people of Panem to attend the "reapings" where one boy and one girl ages 12-18 are chosen from each district to enter the Hunger Games arena (24 kids in total)and fight to the death. When Katniss' younger sister is chosen, Katniss volunteers herself to go in, knowing full well that there is a very good chance she'll never come home. What she doesn't know, is that Peeta, the boy chosen from her district who will enter the arena with her as her enemy, has some secrets of his own that will change everything for Katniss and the citizens of Panem forever.  What I was most surprised to find in this novel was that through all the violence and sadness, there was a great deal of love. Love of family, of friends and on a romantic level as well. The series has the fighting spirit of the oppressed, something that I loved about the Harry Potter series which is executed wonderfully in this series as the books go on. You find yourself caught up in an engrossing story and world, to the point where you're almost certain Panem actually does exist!  As someone with a degree in Mass Media Communications, I found this book absolutely fascinating. Not just from the standpoint of the amazing, imaginative and captivating story but also because of how it reflects on society and the role that entertainment and media play in our lives.  A futuristic and brutal gladiator tale where children are forced to kill or be killed in an around the clock nation-wide broadcast, how could the story not bring to mind the current obsession with reality television? Not only that, but also the media's preoccupation with celebrities, not able to get enough of their personal lives. The contests of the Hunger Games are huge celebrities throughout Panem but mostly in the nations Capitol, the most lavish, well-fed and 'modern' district. As more children are sent off to die each year in front of the entire nation, the people of Panem are growing increasingly hostile towards their government and whispers of change are going around. Completely cut off from one another, the districts know only what the government wants them to know but when the Hunger Games are broadcast live, they may learn more than the government ever intended.  Read these books today, I promise, you won't be disappointed!
Okay, I'll start with the part of the review that most people aren't going to agree with:  I don't think these books are appropriate for teenagers.  Too much violence and a very disturbing premise.  Had I been a teenager reading it, I would have been extremely upset by what I'd read and would have had a hard time getting it out of my head.  With that said:  I'm 40 years old now, and I expect the younger generation is far more jaded than I was.  If so, I do feel sad for them.  In all cases, I'll stand by what I said:  This should be considered light reading for adults rather than for teenagers.  But as an adult who likes science fiction/fantasy:  It's a really fun read.  Wish I'd gotten my copy the first day I arrived at the beach on my recent vacation.  This is the kind of engrossing page-turning wild-premise fantasy story that I enjoy when I've got lazy beach time.  I don't consider this "hard-core" science-fiction as it's spare on detail and the plot is uncomplicated.  With that said, it's really interesting with unexpected details in it.  And it's got some good themes:  self-reliance, fighting-back-against-the-system, etc.  As a total aside and because I'm reminded of it: My favorite fantasy novel as a teen was "Don't Bite the Sun" (Tanith Lee -- now repackaged together along with its sequel in "Biting the Sun").  Similar female narration style, similar weird dystopian future, similar fight-against-the-system theme, WAY less violence, overall more hippie mentality.  :-)  Thanks &amp; I hope this is somewhat helpful.  If you're considering buying the book for your teenager, just be sure to read it first.  You may not agree with my thinking that it's too violent, but the safe bet is to just check for yourself.  I'm sure you'll enjoy the read regardless.  :-)
Hunger Games  By Suzanne Collins  Usually, books full of action such as Warriors, The Twilight Saga, Percy Jackson, and more are to my liking. I read this book around the time the last book, MockingJay, came out. I was very suprised that when I flipped to the last page, I didn't feel the need to get Catching Fire, the second in the trilogy.  PLOT (7/10)  The plot was understandable: Katniss, a girl living in a ruddy, dirty, poor District 12, with her mother and younger sister. There are tweleve districts, 12 being the worst. Katniss must hunt and care for her family because of her mother's...conditions. But, getting to the point, The Hunger Games is a deatly battle between districts, who offer tributes, a boy and a girl. Katniss's sister, Primrose, was picked to be a tribute, but, Katniss offers herself, afraid of losing her. And, that's where I started to lose interest in this book.  It seemed as thought Katniss didn't care that she might as well end up dying in this battle. I couldn't connect with Katniss. I would be utterly terrified if going into a war like this. She was all..no feelings. You see, in my school, we must record our reading on "Reading Logs" and on the back of the reading logs, we must do a connection to the main character and us. Something that happened to us in our lives that also happened to the charcter. I found this hard and finally ended up making up connections that never happened to me or in the book (Thankfully, my Language Arts teacher never read The Hunger Games) Katniss was a seemingly unusual character, who, just might have been the most boring character I will ever know.  LOVE (2/5)  KatnissXPeeta, or KatnissXGale, possibly. I think KatnissXPeeta was more because Katniss didn't interact much with Gale. There were short scenes with the two, but nothing much else, so i found it that maybe they'd be better off friends. Katniss and Peeta had a..difficut relationship. If either one wanted to win the games, they would have to kill each other, even if being from the same district. The love was complicated, but who said love never was?  SUSPENSE (5/5)  I didn't love this book, but the violence was enough to scare Ares. I was expected the Games the be full of action, but didn't know it would be..deep. As deep as the ocean. The suspense in the book was thrilling, but not a good idea for kids under 10. I'm only 12 and the violence made me feel the need to pee in my pants. For some books, getting 5/5 is good. For some, it will make you have nightmares. But depending on the type of person you are, the rating for Suspense might differ.  TEARS (0/5)  (No tears through this book)  CONCLUSION  I was about to give this book one star, but changed my mind. Collins is a good writter, and she has done pretty well with this series, because i know it's quite popular. I just really hope with that good skill, she writes a few different types of books.
This was a well written book with vivid characters and a few side characters I'd like to see a bit more about. The story focuses an Katnis and Peeta: the rest of the characters arn't really well fleshed out, which moves the story along quickly. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the other characters are "Cardboard." There just isn't a lot of info on them.  I see numerous other reviews with in depth plot explanations, so I won't go there on this book. I will try and give food for thought about other aspects of this book.  This is definitely a TEEN book: written to appeal the the TEEN audience by making the main characters between the ages of 12-18. That is the only reason this book didn't get 5 stars from me. I feel the book lost many points on credibly trying to market to a younger audience - at least with me it cost them a star.  Ask yourself this - if you were making people fight to the death, would you throw 12 year-olds into the mix? Even the Roman games had adults in them, not children. Also, which 16 year old could be plucked up out of a 3rd world country and brought into a lavish, ultra-modern, high-tech world, thrown on stage and be well composed or well spoken? Out of 24 I'd say maybe one or two could manage to make a complete sentence in front of thousands of people. The author did a good job of portraying this with Katnis, but she was supposed to be having more difficulty with the live appearance then the other contestants. You would think she would have been the norm.  One last side note... Peeta.... LOL great name choice and a real play on words, considering the other books! Ever heard of a PITA? Pain in the As... (rear)
Lots of people told me how great this book was, so when it went on sale for Kindle  I scooped it up. I have to admit, I kind of like YA novels, especially for sci-fi/fantasy books, because it's easier for my brain to comprehend (if it's written for an 11 year old, I can understand it! *FISTPUMP*). So it made this a very quick read. Although it coincided with the movie release and bowing to pressure from friends, I paused my book halfway to see the movie. I have to say that I prefer the book (another discussion, another forum).  I thought the writing was solid and the characters were well-formed. The author makes it easy to root for Katniss through all of the trials and tribulations of the Games and made her very 'human' and relateable so that I found myself often stopping to think "oh man, what if that was ME? Could I kill someone?" I also enjoyed Peeta more than I thought I would. Lots of people have commented to me that he was whiny or weak but I didn't find that at all. I felt like he was just very accepting of his fate and treated everything very Zen-like (it is what it is). I can understand how some people would read that as weak-willed or even whiny, but I didn't have a problem with him at all.  The concept of the Games is an old one (Battle Royale, Running Man, etc.), but I thought this was a fun interpretation and I really enjoyed the stark contrast of the "new" and "old" in this future (where Katniss is from Appalachia and her father was a coal miner, but in the Capitol everything is so extremely high-tech). Some of the concepts behind not just the Games but the vision of this future were very smart and I look forward to the rest of the series.
I received an early review copy of this book, and I've been recommending it to teens and adults all summer long! On top of that, keeping track of the review copy has been a challenge; everyone who's flipped through a few pages found it impossible to put down.  As the other reviews will tell you, Katniss ends up a competitor in the Hunger Games, where young people from all around a post-apocalyptic nation come together to fight to the death...and maybe keep their families at home safe and well-fed. Katniss has another motivating reason--her younger sister "wins" the lottery, and so she chooses to take her sister's place, even with certain death facing her in the Games. A stay of execution is found in the pageantry and ceremony of the Games, but it's not long before Katniss is in the arena, and must figure out how to survive.  I think this book is so appealing because it combines elements of so many genres: science fiction/speculative fiction, adventure, reality television (yes, really), romance, survival stories, and so on. There are also a number of interesting moral questions to discuss in how the government is run and the choices that the teens make during the Games to survive and to conquer their competitors. Don't expect a breezy children's book where no one needs more than a bandage and a pat on the head; there are no pulled punches.  I disagree that the ending of this book would "only make sense to a woman," as another reviewer said. There's no way to explain further without spoiling the ending, though, except to say that the ending deliberately does not tie up all of the loose threads. The Hunger Games raises many questions, and is all the better for it.  Highly recommended.
I first saw this book many months ago but was scared off by some of the reviews suggesting it was a book geared more towards teenagers.  I then was given a glowing review from a friend who said he didn't understand how it would be considered a book for teens when the premise involves lots of killing.  I then continued to hear good things and decided to cave and give it a read before I watched the movie for it.  It became apparent within the first few pages as to why it is considered that sort of book because it seems to have been written for people who have no attention span.  I mean, it has zero depth to it, the dialogue is as generic and straight forward as can be (the worst offender is at one point when Katniss says "thank you to the people of District 11" which, when put in proper context, is a pathetic attempt at a monologue), and I ended it just wanting so much more.  The book itself is a very entertaining read, and it is easy to just sit down and blow right through it, but this book could have been an all-time favorite of mine had it not been so simplified.  With other books, the reason why most people always like the book more than that movie is because the book, by virtue of it being written, has so much more detail and allows you to truly connect to the characters making you bask in the highs and cry in the lows, but this book was written almost as if it was specifically designed to become a movie.  As I continued with it I convinced myself that the author must have been trying to commercialize it as much as possible because there were a few flashes of literary brilliance that hinted at her abilities.  Very disappointed in it... Oh, and the movie is even WORSE!
I saw the movie first and then read the book. I wish I had read the book first! It was so engaging and well written that I could not put it down. You feel like you are right there in the arena with Katniss. Definitely going to buy the others.
It's written in first person and is a tear jerker. It was also a fast read; I was wondering if that would be the case the first chapter in, but by the time the drawing for the Hunger Games came I was hooked and couldn't put it down.  Strange when you find out what the Hunger Games are - 2 children from each district (all under 18 years of age) forced to battle to the death in a open outside arena for days. The last one standing wins their freedom and a little pocket money. The book is set in the future and reminded me of Running Man or Logan's Run with kids.  The main character is a no-fuss tomboy type whose mother has mentally checked out and left her to fend for the family (her father is dead). She sacrifices herself on behalf of her sister whose name was drawn for the games. You get the idea that her younger sister is all that really matters in the end. She has no problem throwing herself to the wolves if it will buy her sister another day.  Once she gets to the games things get gruesome and tragic very quick. There is several chapters beforehand that deal with the preparation for the Hunger Games which is treated by the elite as a disgustingly immoral televised survival game.  Meanwhile a love triangle develops between the main character and one of the other contestants. The problem is that the other guy in the love triangle is at home watching the game on television, so the only contact the reader has with him is through her memories. This makes it hard to feel much for the guy at home and the triangle seems a tad one sided by the end of the book.  I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone - it pretty hard not to like on some level.
Suzanne Collins is a great writer. I quickly became engrossed in this book and didn't want to put it down. It's great fantasy and you feel like you're there, no problem. I'm keeping it to read again. Inspires me to write my own novel series.
I highly recommend reading this book, even if you've already seen the movie. For instance I saw the movie first but after reading this I had a whole new appreciation for the characters. The movie was great, but the book is soooo much better!
I was interested in this book through the recommendation of my daughter. It is filled with times of sheer excietment and horror at the same time. It is not a book for children but it is one that I would recommend for those who like thillers.
This was an amazing read. I saw the movie before I read it and found many differences. I enjoyed the book much more. It kept me reading because I was  on the edge of my seat the whole time. I can't wait  to read the next books in the series.
First of all this is one of those books where you barely can put it down, so well written it is. I started reading this book 2 days ago and will finish it tonite.  It's well paced, the detailing and descriptions are enough to give substance but not too much to make it boring, the characters are intriguing, and while the book talks about violence and romance, it never gets too much into those aspects that they dominate it.  But most of all the author was able to add a freshness to a theme that is not new per se by combining elements from several other stories, and create contrasting realities between the Capitol and the districts, an explanation of how the Hunger Games operate, and so on.  Life in the districts sound like a Mad Max movie while life in the Capitol seems like one of these sci-fi movies where cities are perfect and everything is easy. The preparation for the Games sounds like one of the celebrity reality shows, but in the future, and the Hunger Games actually come up like a medieval version of the movie The Running Man (with Mr. Schwarzneger) but with technological interferences from the Capitol leaders that include weather changing and mutated animals. And finally, while the combo female author-female teenage main character could sound like a new Twilight series, the only hint from that is the absence of explicit sexuality.  It's definitely not a book to change your life permanently or make you a philosopher, or anything like that. It's just a great read, that will entertain, intrigue and leave you with that sad feeling when it finishes, just like the Millenium trilogy books. Not coincidentally, both were in the best sellers list for several months.
Its the 74th annual hunger games meaning this is the 74th time tributes fight til the death. Every year as punishment to the rebellion of district 13, which no longer exist, the other 12 districts must elect a boy and girl from the ages of 12 - 18 through a reaping. The tributes are later trained and then sent into the arena as they battle with others. A cruicial "celebration", and everyone watches as their children fights for their survival.  However in the story the protagonist Katniss, from district 12, volunteered in the games in order to save her precious sister Primrose. Peeta, the boy canidate is a boy who helped Katniss in her time of need years ago. The games begins and the rule for the 74 years of the game is only one winner.  Katniss enters the arena and it becomes the most memorable year. The Hunger Games gets more intriguing  with twisted events that no one in Panem has ever expected, especially when it is directed towards the Capitol and system.  Although will she survive? What are the consequences to her action?  It is a book I borrowed from my teacher for an assignment and I couldn't put it down, even at my work. Even after reading it and unfortunately returning it, I was determined to get my own copy of the book, so I went out to buy it. An easy read so you can visualize the story like a movie. The writing was amazing, great descriptions and details, it really helped the imagery.  It leads you guessing, but everytime it'll surprise you with something unexpected, a great storyline.  Overall definitely a must read book, especially for sci-fi lovers!  It is recommended for teens and older since it does contain some gruesome parts.
Well written page turner book. Good plot and characters who are alive and real.  The premiss of setting citizen against citizen in a fight to the death is depressing as it resembles the Romans and gladiators of centuries past. . This is a book set in Panum, a country that resides on the ruins of America. There are twelve functioning outer areas whose purpose is to support the capital district. There is a 13th area, which had rebelled and was destroyed. Once a year, a young man and a young woman between the ages of 12 and 18 are selected from each of the twelve districts, and after a brief indoctrination and training period, are transferred to an area. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. She hunts extensively and is skilled with a bow. She knows it will be a very long short for her to survive. The rules are change so that instead on only one winner, that there can be a male and a female winner. The Games are televised to all of the population, and are very popular every year, especially in the capital district. She has many adventures, and does survive with some good breaks and help. She helps the male winner who is injured in the process of surviving.  What is depressing to me is that I believe that this is so popular because we do not find it impossible to believe that there would be people acting like the people in the central district who run the country. I wish that no one could possibly believe that events like the Games in the book could ever happen again on earth, and especially not in the USA.
The Hunger Games is a story set in a bleak post-apocalyptic future controlled by a fascist government.  Modern day North America is now a country called Panem, made up of twelve districts (And a destroyed thirteenth district).  For some reason, the ruling Capitol district requires that each of the twelve districts enlist two of their children to compete in a battle royale (Or Battle Royale, since it borrows heavily from that book) in order to prove that they have control over them.  I'm not really sure how this would be an effective way to keep order, but just go with it.  This review contains spoilers!  Anyway, it's not the worst book I've read, but I can tell that Collins definitely didn't know exactly how she wanted to end it.  As far as the writing goes, there were definitely a few instances where I would read a mangled sentence and just scratch my head.  I wouldn't really say that this is Collins fault so much as the editor, though, so I give this a pass.  What I can't forgive are the inherent flaws with the plot.  Allow me to explain:  1)  The way that the deaths of the contestants are handled.  I think this could be a product of choosing to do a first-person narrative rather than third-person.  Most of the contestants die off screen, and very rarely do we get to see anything actually take place near Katniss (What's with that name, by the way?  But I digress).  I'm pretty sure that the only time in the entire book Katniss directly kills anybody is when she puts an arrow through the throat of Nameless Contestant #whatever after he kills Rue.  Regardless of whether you decide to include the Tracker Jacker "kill" in the list, she never actually had to kill anybody unprovoked and it almost feels kind of cheap on the part of the author.  As an aside, Foxface inexplicably dies from eating poisonous berries which is pretty much the last thing you would expect to happen to an "intelligent" character.  Probably the most heinous example of what I'm talking about is Thresh.  Collins spends quite a bit of the book building up Thresh and making him an extremely imposing obstacle.  I was expecting some big final showdown with Thresh until he suddenly died offscreen.  See what I am talking about here?  2) Way too much of this love business.  I don't really have a problem with Peeta + Katniss or whatever, but why did Collins feel the need to draw it out and act like there's some love triangle going on when there isn't?  Gale is in the book for maybe a few pages.  It makes zero sense to have Katniss feel like she has some big choice to make.  It didn't help that the romance got in the way of some things that would have been interesting to see like, um, the FIGHT WITH THRESH?  3) The rule changes.  It's the author's world, I respect that.  What I don't respect is when the author changes the rules multiple times as it fits the plot.  Don't want Katniss to have to deal with the no-win scenario and off Peeta?  Have the Capitol change the rules for no reason at all.  Need to have some dramatic finale where Katniss and Peeta have to think of a way out of the no-win situation AFTER deciding they wouldn't kill each other? Change the rules back!  Peeta has blood poisoning and you wrote yourself into a corner?  Capitol puts backpacks out filled with things each of the contestants desperately needs!  4) The Muttations (Her word, not mine.)  I can't fathom why Collins thought this was necessary.  I had to reread the paragraph where they're introduced a few times just to digest what the hell was happening.  I understand that this is a futuristic district that has access to impossibly skilled geneticists but since when does genetic engineering mean you can create zombie werewolves?  I'm not kidding, zombie werewolves were put into this book.  It also exposes a pretty obvious plot hole.... think about it:  The Capitol didn't want there to be no winner at all, right?  They reacted pretty quickly when Katniss and Peeta were both going to eat those toxic berries.  So if they were against not having any winner at all, why would they release those killer mutts?  Those things could have killed all three contestants that were remaining pretty easily, and almost did.  See what I mean about this not making any sense?  The ending itself is just worthless on countless levels.  There is really no resolution to anything at all, it's all just a teaser for the next book (Which I will not be reading).  Katniss has a chance to stand up to the Capitol and doesn't.  Peeta really "loves" Katniss but Katniss doesn't "love" him back.  You can argue that this is O.K. because it's a trilogy but it really isn't okay at all.  Each book should be a stand alone story and have a resolution.  Each book of Harry Potter had a resolution, didn't it? It was part of an overarching plot, but each book definitely could stand alone as a good fantasy story.  Not so with this series.  I really wanted to like this book more.  For what it's worth, the world it's set in is pretty interesting and well developed (Well, minus the zombie werewolves).  The book really falls apart once the titular Hunger Games get started, so I really only enjoyed the first half of the book.  It is a young adult novel, so if you want to check it out of the library you can easily read it in a night.  I would not pay money for this book.
These books are both inspiring and heartbreaking. The more I read the more I want to read but the closer I am to the end. I am constantly on the edge of my seat wondering what's going to happen next. And in the end, who will defeat Snow....
Easy, quick read with interesting story. I usually read books that require much contemplation so it was really nice reading a " no brainer" that held my attention and left me wanting more.  Also movie was true to the book.
After seeing the Hunger Games movies, I finally got around to reading the books. The books are better, perhaps unsurprisingly. There's much more of Katniss' inner life, and, perhaps more importantly, more *hunger*. The film did a mediocre job of really portraying how desperate life is for those not in the capital. Also, the book is more brutal and visceral. It says something about the antiquated standards of the MPAA that a book written for tweens needed to be toned down for a PG-13 rating; if 11-14 year olds are reading these books, they should be trusted to be able to handle seeing an accurate depiction of them on-screen.  All three books in the series have a lot to say about modern attitudes towards media, celebrity, government, and so on. There's a refreshingly honest cynicism about power and those who seek it, and how you can easily become the thing you wish to fight against, balanced with a message that even if you know perfection is not possible, this doesn't mean you should stop fighting to get things as good as you can manage.  With a few exceptions, the author rarely has characters explicitly state whatever point is being made; rather, the reader is trusted to take what's being shown and figure out the message themselves. (It's easy to spin things according to whatever political bias you have -- is the decadent, consumerist, Capital an anti-capitalist message, or is the Capital's total control over all production, ownership, and distribution an anti-communist message, or is the message, more correctly, "Power corrupts, and it really doesn't matter what the catchphrases are or what justification the tyrants offer."?)
It all begins with the drop of a hand and the selection of a name. Primrose Everdeen is the name that is called as the crowd falls silent. Primrose Everdeen is the innocent girl everyone loves, and at only twelve years of age, it is a shame she is the one who has been selected to compete in the annual Hunger Games where the prize for winning is the promise of a great life, and the price of losing is an unfortunate death at the hands of another tribute from another district. This news does not sit right with older sister Katniss, who, in a heat of the moment, uses her voice and volunteers herself instead. Suddenly she and boy tribute Peeta Mellark are thrust into a new world, fed foods of the luxurious kind, polished, and treated as royalty as they are transported to the Capitol where they will train until the countdown runs down and the Games begin. Then the bloodshed begins, as all twenty-four tributes have to face the wrath of nature and man until one tribute remains standing as victor.  In what is, quite possibly, one of the rawest, goriest novels I've read, Suzanne Collins has created a fantastic dystopian world with an interesting premise, and amazing execution. It includes a romance, that even though it isn't the main focus of the story, is great enough for me to enjoy. All of the characters were unique in each of their ways, and the descriptions and character building were sublime. Now I know why people love this series so much and I am glad I bought the box set of all three two years ago. Had I known such awesomeness was sitting on my shelf all of this time, I would have picked it up sooner. After reading, I am DEFINITELY Team Peeta ;)
So I had heard a description of this book on NPR one day and was interested in the idea but thought, "No way I'm going to read it. Sounds creepy and depressing." The older I get, the less I can tolerate sad/disturbing movies, books, etc.  But then a colleague read it and raved (like so many) "I could not. put. this book. down. You would love it!"  Fast-forward another year and I decided to start a Young Adult Fiction Book Club with friends. This was our first book choice, so I finally committed to reading it. As you may have guessed, I could not put the darned thing down. It was not depressing (not to me anyway) but simply fascinating. It is the kind of read that makes you feel like you are a kid again, furiously turning the pages to find out what happens next. (Incidentally, all the book club members started emailing each other about how much we all loved the book and how we could hardly wait to talk about it.)  Again, like so many who have talked about this book, I am not a fan of science fiction, but this is sort of in its own category. The characters, the motivations, the overarching plot, it is all unending food for thought. I want to say so much more, but don't want to even taint the first-time-reading experience for any of the book's potential readers. It is such fun to walk into this with no expectations! Enjoy the voyage! Oh, and just to save you time, go ahead and order the other two sequel books now, because you're going to want to reach for them when you get to the last page. I have Catching Fire ready and waiting on my nightstand. Luckily it's Saturday night so if I can't put this one down and lose a night's sleep, so be it!  Have fun!

Quite the page turner.  Much better than the movie.  It's important to read The Hunger Games first.  The books are listed under "children" books but I am way older and really enjoyed the sci-fi because it's not so far from reality.
I heard a lot about this trilogy from friends and from other reviews and I have to say it was more than I expected, after reading it on my kindle I bought the books. It had me from the start and I had to fight to put it down. Just amazing.
The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is the first book in a trilogy. I will admit that I saw the movie first, but I always make sure to read the books of movies I see. No comparison will be drawn between the two.  The main character, Katniss, is a skilled hunter who provides food for her mother and younger sister. In the world of Panem, The Hunger Games take place once a year and force one boy and girl between 12 and 18 years old from each of the twelve districts to fight to the death. A chain of events leads to the fact that Katniss, this year, is the so called tribute for District 12.  The characters in this book are unique and diverse. Katniss is strong-willed and surrounded by a variety of characters that each have their own unique personality. I grew to love almost every one of them in some way or another.  My one issue is that we did not get the chance to learn more about the other tributes, aside from very basic information. While I do understand that Katniss, herself, could not learn much about them or else it would ruin the game, I still feel it would have been nice to know a bit more.  That aside, Suzanne Collins did a good job keeping me interested in the story. It was not packed with action at every moment; the start is much slower and there are moments of rest, despite the threat that looms overhead.  Overall, I enjoyed this book and will be reading its sequel soon. Four out of five stars due to small things that I feel could have been improved upon, like getting to know the other tributes, but it's still a great book.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good dystopian novel.
When I was first told about The Hunger Games, I never in a million years thought that I would like this book. I'm not a big fan of killing and sad stories. Especially children killing children. However, as morbid as it sounds, I was pleasantly surprised.  To start off, I loved the writing. I love books with a lot of suspense in them, and this one nailed it. The writing drew me in, and I was unable to put it down. I just had to find out what happened next. I was also happy with the fact that it wasn't terribly gruesome (I don't like blood and guts and gore too much).  I also loved the characters. I was afraid for them, cried for them, at some points I even wished I was them (I am a sucker for romance, I have to admit, and Peeta's character was rather appealing to me).  Now to the sad part. The reason that I only gave it three stars. The first reason is, I really don't like the idea of brutality and children killing children. I prefer happier subjects to be honest. My visualization skills are excellent, and I hate to see a twelve year old die in my head.  Also, some of the dialogue and story choices didn't make too much sense to me. In the beginning, the way the author writes sounds almost forced, but that eventually goes away within the first few chapters. Another example is the part with the [ fallen tribute dog mutations in the end. It didn't make sense to me, wasn't well explained (did the dogs embody the fallen tributes' souls? did they have their eyes? I just didn't get it), and it seemed kind of thrown in there. I would have preferred Katniss or Peeta to have killed Cato directly, over these dog things.
I've never really done a full review of an audiobook, so this will be quick. This audiobook was excellent! The narrator was amazing in her character portrayals and did a great job in transferring Suzanne Collins tone to her audience. I could feel the suspense and emotions that Katniss went through; I could imagine the scenery and endure the desperation. The plot was filled with rebellion, hope, survival, the passion of unrequited love and debts to be paid. I'm enthused to begin on Catching Fire!  Quotes I took from bookmarking the audiobook:  "The Rules of the Hunger Games are simple:  in punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing, wins." (part 1, 30:25)  "I can't help comparing what I have with Gale, to what I'm pretending to have with Peeta. How I never questioned Gale's motives, while I do nothing but doubt the latter's. It's not a fair comparison, really. Gale and I were thrown together by a mutual need to survive. Peeta and I know the other's survival means our own death." (part 3, 49:00)  "There's no way to take revenge on The Capitol, is there? Then I remember Peeta's words on the roof, `only I keep wishing I could think of a way to show The Capitol they don't own me. That I'm more than just a piece in their games.' And for the first time, I understand what he means." (part 6, 50:00)
To an extent, authors must write what the market demands. If it is gore, or hormonal tantrums that are in demand, the author must write about gore and hormonal tantrums. That's essentially what this book contains, together with a narcissistic depiction of luxury that neither the characters nor most of us would ordinarily have.  Yet, authors have the opportunity to mix in a more nutritious message. I picked up the book hoping that in addition to the gore there would be a unique exploration of the circumstances of an America divided into an imperial center and colonized periphery. I thought there would be segues into the economics, the political arrangements. At least a shimmer of a coming re-revolution.  But no, the only faintest allusion to such matters is a couple of sentences every 100 pages where a particularly adolescent mind thinks hissily "if only the capital hadn't forced us to fight". What a waste! Even a historical account of how things came to be that way would have been nice. But no, the sole focus of such an intriguing context is just a minimal excuse for a setting where humans kill each other for the entertainment of other human beings.  The rest of the text is divided roughly equally into gore, and the most simplistic kind of emotional angst. The latter comprises of person A kind of being nice to person B and then person B feels particularly obliged to person A sparing their life for just a little bit.  It occurs to me that it is nothing but an extension of the tabloid/reality-show fascination. The fact that it is  popular with current youth bothers me because I was kinda hoping things would swing back to better with the next generation, but part of me worries that they'd just love to have some excuse to watch some kind of kill-fest. And there's a lot of war going around already.  Also "Peeta" - the most ridiculous choice of name in a novel with also a significant focus on food. Yes, all the basal instincts are covered and nothing at at a higher plane. The love story from Peeta's side is as sappy and simplistic and unbelievable as it possibly could be.  One more thing, be prepared to develop a mild desire to eat rabbit as you work through the gore and sap.
Suzanne Collins' "The Hunger Games" is a story about Katniss, who is a survivor from the word go; she hunts, traps, and gathers in order to feed her mother and younger sister despite the fact she's only sixteen.  Her best friend is a guy named Gale; he's a few years older than she, is also a hunter/gatherer, and they both evade the authorities in their dystopic near future with ease.  After Ms. Collins introduces these two, she shows what she calls "the reaping," which is how the Hunger Games gets contestants; two teens, from ages twelve to eighteen, must compete against each other from every district -- this is a dictate from the ruling dictator (or dictators) of Panem, and no one can evade it.  (In Panem, there are twelve districts.  Katniss comes from the absolute poorest, District Twelve, which comprises modern day Appalachia.)  To Katniss's horror, her younger sister Primrose is chosen in the reaping despite being only twelve and having only one entry.  (There are ways to get extra oil and grain if you sign up for more entries, which is why getting chosen on your first reaping with only one entry is extremely maddening, as well as shocking.)  Katniss volunteers instead; she knows she'll probably die, but her sister definitely will and to her, that means she must be the one who goes.  The other contestant chosen is a young man named Peeta, who is just Katniss's age; he's a baker by trade, but isn't really any stronger or healthier than is Katniss.  (Everyone in District Twelve is starving, it appears, except for the politicians.  Even they aren't doing too well.)  During the competition of the Hunger Games, we find out a lot more about Katniss, a lot more about Peeta, and a lot more about this dystopic world -- mostly, I wanted to take the whole lot of them out of there and get them somewhere safe, wherever that is considering a lot of the former U.S. of A. in Collins' vision has been blown to bits and we really don't find out anything about the other countries of the world.  (Apparently the dictatorship of Panem doesn't want the citizens to know there are any other alternatives out there.)  This is an excellent novel despite its grimness; I especailly enjoyed the budding, halting romance between Peeta and Katniss (she's a strong, silent type and Peeta is much more open -- I liked this role reversal).  There also was some excellent action-adventure going on, which I definitely appreciated.  But the best reason to read this book is because it doesn't talk down to anyone, it doesn't preach to anyone -- it just tells the story through Katniss's eyes, and it works.  Very well.  Four stars, recommended for all ages despite some violence.  Barb Caffrey
When the book first came out I wasn't interested. Then I saw the movies and began to find my self wanting more after each one. The audio booked helped to fill in all the blanks the movie altered and or omitted while given that movie feel.
I didn't expect this book to be as good as it was. Katniss is an appealing character; you find yourself caring about her almost from the beginning of the book. There's good suspense woven throughout. Looking forward to reading the sequel.
This is a awesome book, but I recommend this book for 12-17 years and older. It's very gruesome  and  involves children killing children.  Other than that it is a awesome book.  And may the odds be ever in your favour. Happy Hunger Games!
Instant classic and deservedly so.  This woman can tell a story very well.  You don't realize until it's over how much of it is already true.  This isn't science fiction; it isn't fantasy; it isn't young-adult fiction.  This is your life.
So I guess it's good that it's a trilogy then, huh? Good read, great for the summer. Concept is dark and at times, can be a real bummer...but overall, if you are looking for a  fast-paced and thought-provoking read, this is what you want.
When the motion picture of The Hunger Games was released, I had no idea what this series was about. I'm not one to jump on the bandwagon, until I heard it was about New World Order and apocalyptic themes. Being as a fan of possible futures, I dug my heels in and bought the book. The narrative was easily accessible with great visuals of a place like we know, but lost in a terrible fate. Katniss Everdeen's narrative was strong, as a girl that was trapped in world where food was scarce and she had family to take care after her father's death. This touching story had me spellbound with baited breath never wanting to see even a paragraph ahead, it was that good. The romance was well suited and not at all heavy handed like the "Twilight" series. Frankly, love is just another part of Katniss's life that she can lose in the Games. The most surprising element was how moving the protagonist's sensitivity for her fellow competitor was illuminated. On the other hand, this story didn't throw down a story that was too much of a political agenda, and where it was bordering on it, it never strayed very far into a contemporary political message. The story was fresh and new merging the elements of the Greek or Roman Colosseum and the sensationalized reality TV. Leaving the reader with a couple moral questions: if the Hunger Games was a real event on TV now, would you watch it? If you would, what does that say about society and ourselves? I would highly recommend it to anyone about that likes apocalyptic themes, accessible narratives, and a strong sensitivity to the plight of humanity that are conscripted against their will to die for the amusement of strangers.
This review is only for the first book, The Hunger Games.  I really enjoyed reading this book, far more than I actually thought i would. The pacing was somewhat slow in the beginning, which I think can be typical because that's where the author sets up the background and story, and speeds up slightly towards the end. There are places where it drags a bit, but overall the pacing is decent.  The character of Katniss is interesting to me--at times she seems to live in an emotional void, yet she is strongly effected by certain people or situations. I would never have used the word strong to describe her as many other people do, but I will say she's a survivor. She is a really complex character that was hard for me to grasp and figure out who she is exactly. I loved the character of Peeta because he just always seemed comfortable with who he is and strong because of it--his character seemed to be light and hope. For me Gale was a harder character to grasp, which is interesting considering that he really is a central figure in Katniss' life.  The Hunger Games: the games are violent, but not as graphic as I thought they could have been. I'm not disappointed since it is a young adult novel. There were times when any sense of urgency is lost, which I kind of felt sad about because it is a "fight for your life" even she is in. Certain parts really moved me and made it hard to put the book down.  Overall, this is definitely an easy book to read. Personally, I responded really well to the world Collins created and had a very hard time putting the book down. I also think it is a book I will read again in the future.
This book was extremely well-written and entertaining. Katniss was well-defined and relatable. The emotions were gripping, and I couldn't help but be sucked into the action. I started reading and couldn't put it down. Highly recommended!
I kinda hated this book. I felt like it was awefully written and had to force myself to even finish the book. Not even close to Harry Potter or twilight. This book would only be good high schoolers younger than 16, and that's pushing it.
I really enjoyed this book.  I have read the whole series but this one is the jewel of the three.  This reminds me of when I was reading the Lord of the Rings series.  I got so wrapped up in their world that I hated to put the book down.
The writing was pure and believable.  The way Collins broke down the characters and where they came from was down right reality at it best. I want people to read this book they will get a ride of a life story. I gave this book six star .
In book 1 the 74th annual Hunger Games are approaching. The way it works is that one boy and one girl between the ages of 12-18 from each district put in what I consider as a raffle with their name on it according to there age starting at one raffle at twelve and so on to be  chosen to fight to the death where only one remains (There are 12 districts). In the homes of District 12 lye some of your characters Katniss Everdeen (Main Character), her sister Prim(short for Primrose), her mother(her father died), Gale(her best friend), and Peeta Mellark. Also if you decide to take a tesserae or a years supply of grain and oil for one person that means you have to enter your name in the raffle another time(you can do this as many times as you want). Now getting back to the summary, Katniss, Prim and her mother are getting ready for the reaping(the reaping is the day the names are chosen). When they get there, Katniss and her mother believe that since Prim's name is in there only once that she will not be chosen. That all changes once Prim's name is called as tribute over the loudspeaker. Katniss and her mother are shocked and Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place where she will meet different people and have to choose between life and death.    I thought that this book was a must read because of all the excitement and suspense that was put into this book like when it says "Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip of paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. And it's not me. It's Primrose Everdeen." Another opinion that I had on this book is that I think it is 13 and older book because of how deep the book can get.
This novel, the first in a trilogy, is written for a young adult audience (7th grade and up) with a female lead.  But The Hunger Games had more than enough firepower and complexity to completely captivate this middle-aged male.  I won't ruin the book by telling you much about it, but imagine a mash-up of Shirley Jackson's classic 1948 short story The Lottery and the novel The Running Man by Stephen King (writing under the pseudonym Richard Bachman).  Take those ideas from a 16-year-old girl's perspective in a future America that hasn't turned out well, and you've pretty much got the idea.  Written in the first-person, the lead character's voice had me from page one.  Once in a while Ms. Collins slips up and falls out of that strong voice for a phrase or two.  Usually that takes me out of the story, but with The Hunger Games the occasional off notes only serve to remind me how stinking good this book is and how powerful the voice of Katniss is throughout.  It's a violent book.  Characters suffer gruesome injuries or are killed by spears, fire, insects, arrows, rocks, explosives, etc.  I'm not sure every 7th grader is ready for this one.  There's a love triangle of sorts running through that rings false because it's all too chaste.  That our heroine spent all those days alone in the woods back home with her hunting buddy, and he never once put any moves on her--well, it defies logic.  I guess that must be one of the conventions of YA fiction--violence okay, sexuality not okay.  Despite its tiny flaws, this is one beautiful book, and the humanity in it comes through like the voice of the singing mockingjays in the land of Panem.
My 12 y.o. son and I began this book fighting over who was taking longer to turn the page because that's what it started out as - a page turner..... fer sure!  But of couse I lost out and he filled me in on the ending because I had to oversee his homework assigned by his 6th grade teacher. The assignment required a written page for each 2 chapters on What I KNOW, What I want to learn in these next 2 chapters and finally What I LEARNED from reading these 2 chapters.  When he explained the last several chapters to me I tried not to signal my disappointment.  I asked him how he felt about the plot resolution and he said.... hmmm kinda ho hum... that he was expecting more.  I mean I get that the premise is fighting to the death but when we looked at Katniss' evolution - she went from a self-sacrificing - give my life for my loved ones - to survival of the fittest - to 'Gee - let's play russian roulette with dual suicide and see if that works to get our way'.  Maybe that works for an older age of young adults but I was a little dismayed at the suicide pact when the real world of young adults has its fair share of this reality. So I asked my son, what was the author's message? What was Suzanne Collins' theme - what was she saying to her readers? That sometimes it's ok to kill? That morality is not so clear when our lives are at stake?  Maybe I'm not a mother of a teenager yet and may have to eventually deal with the 'oh mom - it's just a story' - 'i'm not going to go out and kill or be killed'  So what was the Author's message?  My son asked - "Do all stories have to have an author's message, mom?"  Well - what do y'all think?
To me this series feels reminiscent of the Harry potter books. I can imagine children in their preteens reading this book with the same excitement I had reading Harry potter when those books first came out.  Well worth a read.
Every time I read it, I discover a new twist or the incredible genius that Suzanne Collins  created with her complex character development and subplots. I haven't found anything else that even comes close to the caliber of this trilogy!
This was the first book I read on my kindle, and it made an awesome first impression.  I read a number of articles about this book in the past, but only read it recently after encountering so many positive reviews; I had to check it out.  I am so thankful I did.  Do not be turned off by the genre 'young adult'; I know that for many novels, this means sappy or silly.  The Hunger Games appeals to a wide audience, young and old alike.  I won't rehash the plot, but it is an interesting and unique one.  Collins describes a future that is not only detailed, but frighteningly realistic.  While you may read the plot and think that a tournament of killer children may seem ridiculous, but this book just seems possible.  There are so many elements that I recognized: the televised hype for the games was similar to American Idol, the tributes' stylists performed similarly to politicians' 'handlers', an overall love of violence that is just a few steps away from the current cultural love of a bloodbath.  I think this novel has a lot to say, and does it in such a way that is entertaining too.  The one thing I loved about this novel instantly was how it grabs you from the first paragraph and never slows down.  Collins does not waste a lot of time introducing long detailed accounts of Panem's history, and what she does reveal is enough for the reader to understand but still want more.  It's a thrilling novel, but also emotional as well.  Katniss is a strong female character, forced to grow up much faster than her 16 years, but the audience does not forget that yes, these are children killing each other.  Highly recommended.  Read this today!
I have never, ever read a book like The Hunger Games. I was completely blown away, in a good way. :) The plot, the characters, the entire world Collins created is completely original and unlike anything I've ever encountered before. I'd heard that this book was good, but I had no idea that it would be this amazing. Why I let it sit on my shelf for so long before giving it a short is beyond my comprehension.  From the very fist chapter, I felt myself bonding with the characters. They are incredibly realistic, and they bring the story to life. Katniss is a strong protagonist that I can admire and believe. Unlike some strong female characters, Katniss tough personality is a learned skill instead of a personality trait. This helped me to understand her a lot more. The other tributes and characters are equally interesting. They all certainly added to my love of the novel.  I've always loved drama. Who doesn't like a bit of suspense in their books? Everything about The Hunger Games is dramatic- from the reaping to the games. I was constantly wondering what would happen next. This is one of the first books I've read in a long time that had me sneaking away to my room every chance I got. I was desperate to find out what happened next. While the concept of teens battling it out in an area  is somewhat disturbing, it was impossible to not be fascinated.  The Hunger Games is now one of my favorite books. It was absolutely brilliant, and I will be recommending it to all of my fellow readers. I've heard awesome things about the sequel, Catching Fire, and I cannot wait to see what happens next in this captivating series. Five stars!
I absolutely loved this book!  From start to finish I couldn't stop reading it. Every chapter leaves you wanting to know what happens next and even after I finished the book it left me wondering.  It was great, I really recommend it :)
Spoiler alert:  When I started reading this my first thoughts were: 'oh great, Battle Royale rip-off incoming'.  It managed to get over my apprehensions and I soon found myself enjoying this story and having an invested interest in the mostly well-written characters and bleak world.  There were some incredible moments, and some very sad ones.  The writing overall was incredible and its on that merit I'm giving Hunger Games three stars.  However, some things just felt out of place.  First off, there's Katniss.  She's the most unlikeable protagonist in the book (not that that is saying very much).  She's selfish and vindictive towards Peeta and the others. and really isn't responsible for her image.  Cinna did the legendary flaming dress, Peeta gave her that love story, Haymitch sent her the gifts, and Rue pointed out that tracker Jacker nest.  Its like everything manages to work out for her personally.  The good moments for her aren't enough of redemption.  Second off, what's with the symbolism.  Okay Collins, I get it, you don't have to name every person after food to tell me that food is important.  You don't have to give every capitol citizen a Roman name to put the whole Panem=Rome symbolism across.  Its like Collins is beating the reader over the head with an anvil.  The symbolism made the book feel artificial and a bit silly.  If I had the time I would've gone on further.  Every time Hunger Games gets into a smooth rhythm, some flaw derails it.  All in all, this book is overrated.  Good? yes.  Worthy of being number one for a year and a half? not at all.  Another, better book deserves that number one slot for a bit.
Liked the narrative being done by the main character.  Made the story move more smoothly.  Very descriptive and easy to flollow what was occurring . Didn't like the ending.  Felt it was a non ending and made katniss seem very shallow.
This is one of the most captivating young-adult science fiction novels I have read in a long time.  The "science" isn't overbearing, the story moves fluidly, and I love the strong female protagonist.  I wish there were more like it.
This book should have a PG-13 or R rating.  The violence and subject matter are mature and should include plenty of parent/child/teacher/group discussion!    That aside...The Hunger Games is a book I really hate to admit...I enjoyed enough to give it a 5-star rating!  Collins' plot sounded sooo implausible...and horrific.  Then I opened the book and begin reading!    My pre-conceived notion regarding implausibility became an evening tide, each wave encroaching on and stealing away my peace of mind as I became increasingly engrossed in her remarkable story telling...to the point of spending nearly every waking moment with my nose in these books from beginning to end (pretty much the entire bad-weather weekend)!    That plot and the violence both intrigued and frightened me....throughout the series.  Collins' research into the psychology and sociology of the human spirit was beyond impressive!  Her depiction of the climactic downward spiral of civilization was intense and made me feel sickened.  ABSOLUTE FEAR, including torture and intense suppression CAN and DOES result in a remarkably quick descention into psychotic (robotic, passive, manic, depressive - CRAZY) behaviors!  And Collins explained and depicted how ANY minor rebellion from within the ranks of VICTIMS was easily squashed when immediate torture and/or termination was applied, and telivised, publicly!    The Hunger games trilogy was a house of mirrors and a house of horrors, combined.  As much as I enjoyed it, I'm not ready to recommend it to teens and especially 'tweens' without WARNING parents:  read it first and be prepared to discuss it!
I'm not really giving just this first of three books 5 stars... I'm giving the trilogy a 5-star rating altogether.  The book was recommended to me by a young woman at work who mentioned that her father (my age) had "borrowed" the book from her and wouldn't give it back.  Now this intrigued me, because this is a very bright, articulate girl, and so I had to assume her father was likely no intellectual slouch either.  I also found it curious that a YA-rated book would get this level of accolade from a more mature crowd... so I decided to give it a try.  Wow.  I read copiously, and yet SELDOM do I ever make the statement that "I couldn't put it down" or that "I read until 4am".  I made both those statements while reading these 3 books.  Brilliantly-drawn characters with great depth; it was easy to become caught up in the drama in each of their lives.  Even the "2nd-string" characters -- like the community families, etc -- were developed enough that you remembered them throughout the entire ordeal.  If anything, the author drew the lead characters with almost TOO MUCH maturity for their ages (just the opposite of my remarks on the horrible trilogy of Natusch's that I just reviewed).  Intriguing plot, snappy dialogue, plenty of action... the author did seem to run out of steam a bit at the end, but it's completely forgiveable, given the whirlwind pace maintained throughout the first 2 books.  Ms. Collins is definitely an author on whom to keep your eye... which certainly shouldn't be too difficult to do with the acclaim she's garnering (and the movie recently released) with this superb offering.  Can't wait to read more!
The Hunger Games takes place in a futuristic world, where the countries that populated the continent once called North America have been destroyed, and a new nation called Panem has emerged. Panem is comprised of thirteen cities: The Capitol, and twelve "districts." Katniss is a sixteen-year-old girl from District 12. Through a turn of events she is chosen to play in the Hunger Games: a contest in which the winner brings home a wealth of food to their indigent district. The only catch is that the contest is a fight to the death with 23 other contestants from the 12 Districts of Panem.  The author, Suzanne Collins, sets up a very interesting atmosphere for the reader in The Hunger Games. As you read, you have a lot of questions about the mysterious Hunger Games, and the futuristic dystopia Panem. This draws you closer to the main character, Katniss, who is in a similar position. You will soon find yourself immersed in her world, and her fight for her life. Collins' writing style keeps the reader interested, while leaving some of the details of the world she has created nebulous. This adds to the interest of the book, and the readers will find themselves burning through the chapters to finish the story.  I found The Hunger Games to be a well written and intriguing book. As I read, I was drawn into the world of Panem. The plot is very original and gripping, and I found myself living out the Games right along with the main character, Katniss. When you pick this book up, you will not be able to put it down.  It is a quick read and the story pulls you right through to the end. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
The Hunger Games, by Suzanne Collins, is an action-packed book, written in first person. It is a great futuristic fiction novel. It is about sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the frowned-upon, poor District Twelve. Each year, a boy and a girl from ages twelve-eighteen, from each of the twelve districts are chosen to fight in The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a cruel event to remind the districts that the Capitol has power over everything. It is also a televised happening when twenty-four boys and girls are pitted against each other, to fight to the death. Will Katniss be selected to compete in this cruel episode? If so, will she survive? Read The Hunger Games and find out! I think that this is a great book because there are a lot of cliffhangers, and you always get hooked, and want to find out more.  This book can get gory and graphic occasionally, so I would recommend this to ages thirteen-adult.  Are you looking for good book with lots going on? If you are, STOP and read The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. The Hunger Games is about a city with twelve districts held in tight reigns by the capitol. Each year every district sends one boy and one girl to an arena to fight to the death. When 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen's little sister is chosen by the lottery to compete in the annual Hunger Games, she steps in to take her sister's place. This is my favorite book and I would give it five stars. Although I loved this book, I thought it was a really scary and graphic book, and I would not recommend it to anyone below the age of ten. I hope you have decided to read The Hunger Games and enjoy!
I gave The Hunger Games a four out five stars because it is one of the most brutal, deep and terrifying novels I ever read. Before I go on, I just have to say that the movie does not do it justice. It is a well-crafted universe that keeps you hooked onto it until the end. It keeps turning up the dial in turns of suspense and you find yourself urging Katniss, the protagonist, on to the very end. It's themes of love, determination and perseverance against impossible odds awe you with its impact. I loved how the book spared no expense in fleshing out its characters and giving us people to root for. The inner turmoil that goes on inside Katniss throughout the book goes to show that these are not people that go into the Hunger Games, the Capitol's way of showing its dominance over the other districts, and become good at the end. Instead she struggles with outside conflicts that she has no idea how to fight off. Katniss learns important lessons about making friends, showing and giving trust, and what is at stake and how her defiance throughout the games becomes a symbol of hope to the districts. I disliked however when the events stalled in the book when Peeta, Katniss's friend in the games, and her were in the cave. It seemed hard to read because there was little action but that was just for me. The scene was most likely made for plot development, which is why this book is so great. Its not action that makes Collins book so great, it the suspense and inner turmoil. I recommend this book to those interested in a book with a nice balance of gory, bloody action and more personal accounts of loyalty, survival and idealism.
This review has been crossposted from my blog at The Cosy Dragon.com. Please head there for more in-depth reviews by me, which appear on a timely schedule.  Katniss has been selected as a tribute for The Hunger Games, run by the Capitol to keep their Districts in check. Thrust into the arena with no friends that she knows of, she realises that she must kill to survive - even if it means overcoming old alliances.  Katniss appeals to me in this novel. Her personality is consistent and attractive, even if I don't agree with all of her actions. You feel her anxiety at the choosing, and her excitement over the food on the train. All excellent character building.  I don't quite agree with the amount of paranoia Katniss engages in. She thinks everything is a trap. The scene with Rue is particularly out of place - why should she trust her? Poor Rue.  Something I would have enjoyed was a bit more perspective from Peeta. He's the weaker character of the two - now that they are both older, it seems like Katniss is the only one doing any work. He's good at moping! I guess in his own way he does try to protect her, but he doesn't do it in a particularly bright way every time.  The Arena is well imagined, although not as awesome as the Arena in the second novel. What I wouldn't give to be a Gamemaker or a genetic engineer working for the Capitol.  After having put off reading these for a long time, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality overall. I was a bit urked at the beginning that there was so much annoying description, but it improved as the book proceeded.
Didn't think I would enjoy this.  I did not like the first movie very much, but so many friends said they really enjoyed the books that I thought I'd try it and I am very pleased. It is well written and adult.  I highly recommend it.
I had already watched the movie and decided that the book was something that I had to read. I was not disappointed.  The characters were very well written and even though I knew what was going to happen it was still a very good read.
I very much enjoyed The Hunger Games; it created a unique civilization and reminded me a bit of  the books The Giver and Gathering Blue.  The highest compliment I can pay is to say that I will now look forward to reading its sequels.
I wasn't sure about this book because all I've heard about it is that a bunch of people kill each other in a stupid competition for the amusement of the capital. All I have to say is that YOU SHOULD JUST READ THE BOOK!!! It's awesome
The book's plot was good. The character development makes you want to quit your day job and hope to be as good a writer as Suzanne--fantasy wise. The story seemed plausible with the juxtaposition of the bestiality that characterized the human populace in the early centuries (think Gladiator) and the technology advancement of our present and foreseeable future albeit at it's most rudimentary level. What I found most worrisome was the constant commentary about being hungry by the protagonist. I know it is called "the hunger games" but the food talk became overbearing. I am yet to find a book where the title indeed was the theme for an inordinate amount of the book. It disengaged me mostly during those episodical food ramblings by the protagonist and I found myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the core of the story and the ending particularly. I praise her careful consideration of what our race, or what we know to be our most evolved species is capable of doing pre- and post- the apocalypse. Which says more about our most mundane and primal inclinations bordered on evil. Look around you today and the world portrayed in "Hunger games" is not a fantastical one. It could be a world you will find yourself in. In fact, the more the years pass, the more sophisticated we will be at finding ways to amuse ourselves, at the expense of humanity.    Anyways, since I am not necessarily commenting as a 7th Grader for a class grade, I will stop short at, saying, but for all the hunger and food talk, the plot, story-line and suspense is just right there. Not that climactic but will give you cause to introspect.
This was one of our book club selections and I was not looking forward to reading it. While on one hand it sounded intriguing and I had already heard good things about it, the subject matter wasn't such a lure for me. In the future nation of Panem, a boy and a girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen are drawn in a lottery to be participants in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is an annual competition which takes place in the capitol of the twelve existing districts. The twist is that the kids must fight to the death. There is only one survivor.  To my great surprise though, I loved The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins! It was interesting, suspenseful, imaginative, sad, a real yank at the heart. The book was an action-packed whirlwind from the beginning scenes of life in the village, to the lottery drawing, to the physical and mental preparation, and to the actual game itself. The game takes place in a controlled environment, a bubble of sorts, where the coordinators can manipulate the physical surroundings to influence participant action. I was on the edge of my seat as Katniss and Peeta pitted against each other fought for survival, then were urged on as a team, then to the surprise twist.  And at the emotional end I was ready for the second installment, Catching Fire, and finally the third, Mockingjay. Because the books were short and easy, geared toward a young adult audience, I wasn't annoyed in continuing on (since I'm not a big fan of series). In fact, I was very enthusiastic. In the end I urged my husband and son to read the series, and no surprise, they both liked them, too
Must admit it was better than I had expected.  I found however that the lead character when faced with a chioce, didn't make the selfish choice, but was concerned with others. She also found that cooperation was better than killing.
I enjoyed the series. I felt like Katniss was well fleshed out and her actions generally made sense within her personality and circumstances. In fact the characters in general were well fleshed out.  My main problem with the book is how easy to manipulate everyone who wasn't an actual character was (the citizens of the Capital, and of the rest of the districts for that matter). It's hard to believe that everyone would behave so very callously, without more open dissent showing.  Especially since the citizens of the Capital are supposed to value children - is it really believable that if that was the case, that these parents would be salivating watching other children fight to the death? And that more of the children themselves wouldn't choose to sacrifice themselves for family members/beaus? We can be a heartless race, but less so when it comes to our own friends and family.  The problem with totally buying into the way that this society and its members work is that if I did, I stopped wanting to save any of them. Thankfully, since the actual characters themselves were nuanced some of that could be ignored.  Also, is it just me, or did it seem like she was always hunting really successfully, eating seemingly huge meals (multiple geese, rabbits, deer, etc.), and yet constantly starving and losing weight? I mean, she went a day here or there without eating but in general she brought something in just about every time she hunted, including some fairly large animals. How fast is her metabolism?? I mean, if you compare her consumption with that of actual starving people she should be practically obese.
i am an ten year old girl and i hate reading. But the hunger games is the best and i cannot wait to read the next one. I got this book from  book fair. I got the last one there. love the charactes and the story. Get the book!!!!!!!
The social aspect of the book is a future of the world that has a theme as old as time. Power and control, manipulation of the people through poverty, it is interesting to see how the author twists the theme into a whole new story.
I first heard of this book from a friend and was a little skeptical to buy it when I found it in the "young adult" section of my book store. But I had checked out the reviews, which were all positive, so I went for it. Right from the first page I was hooked. I consider this a dark thriller and I am normally a romantic comedy kind of book reader but I have to say that this book has definitely influenced me to branch out on my reading style.  The idea of this world under a government on a control trip instantly created so many questions that were answered throughout the book. I think the main characters were amazing and loveable even if they didnt have the most loveable personalities. With each page turned there was never a moment of true predictability. Most of the time I was shocked at the brutality or the twist of events. Most of all I could relate to Katniss's love for her little sister and her act of selflessness. In addition, the relationship between Katniss and Peeta left me on the edge of my seat wondering when, if ever, Katniss would accept him.....but then there was Gale!? Of course, the games and the harsh reality of what these CHILDREN had to do in order to keep peace was horrible. But out of it came a new respect for the value of life and even new friendships.  When I finished the book I wasted no time picking up the second, as I had purchased the second and third books while I was still reading this one! I would definitely recommend the book to anyone who just enjoys a good read. Its suspenseful, emotional, horrifying, and special. This book is an easy read and truly addictive.
I must say I went into this book reluctantly. I found the premise to be disturbing--a bunch of teenagers going around killing each other. But so many people enjoyed it I thought I'd give it a try. I enjoyed the beginning. The pre-battle preparations I think teens might enjoy but it seemed unrealistic that there was not more discussion and feeling about their impending death. I felt puzzled at the morality of the whole thing which never seemed to be addressed. I think young people could have benefited from more discussion and attention to what this meant to your fellow contestant--even the worst are from families that would be devastated at their loss. There also was no history or understanding of exactly how these games came about other than a nebulous referral to a "rebellion". I would have liked more development of that and I found the public viewing of the games nauseating. I would have given it 3 stars because of those points but on the positive side, I found the writing of the last half of the book page turning and exciting and found myself immersed in it. I thought the author did a good job of not being overly gory and had several of the deaths occur from the environment they encountered rather than direct hits from each other. I thought the death of Rue showed one of the few moments of humanity in the book. However, looking at it as a fantasy story to take you to another place it think it was exciting and adventurous and I did like some of the creative thinking of the characters and their resourcefulness. I think it would make a thrilling movie and fun to see all the costumes and scenery
very rarely is the movie better than the book . Anyone who knows me can agree that I LOVE the movies . In this case it is . The book better than the movie . The Hunger Games is one of those books that the movie will leave a lot of unanswered questions and reading the book fills those holes . Being that I saw the movie long before reading the book , I enjoyed it for the most part except until the end Katniss seemed whiny and childish . She's supposed to be 16 &amp; the sole provider for her family . Example , during the games Katniss being severely upset with the death of Foxface . Sad , yes , that they are put in that situation but the sad reality is that only ONE could live .  May the odds be ever in your favor !  During the games , every chapter is hunting and hunting , filling my canteen , more hunting , sleeping in my sleeping bag oh yes and hunting . OMG enough already , there was more survival over conversation . We get it , I understood the need to eat , with it being the HUNGER games !! Extremely drawn out scenes and extremely boring scenes . More interesting stuff , the moat annoying and unnerving part of the book was probably Katniss's unlikable whining . Why I continued to read it is beyond me because I DID like it !!! But I loved the movie so much with my obsession with it that I had to continue reading !! Yes , some of the scenes are far better read on screen than in paper but that's just on the imagination of movie makers . I can see this being ons of those awful books that are included in required reading in school . Except not so awful . An instant classic .
This review was written by my 12 year old daughter.  The reality of The Hunger Games    I am a diligent reader for my age, and I have repeatedly proclaimed The Hunger Games as my favorite book. Not only because it is well written but the plot makes you think. From the moment I began to read it I was totally engrossed in this novel.  I found the characters exciting and deep. Particularly the protagonist Katniss Everdeen with her undying need to survive and protect those that are weaker than she. I enjoy that Katniss is a girl that stands on her own, and she does not simply take what she is given. There is a romance which some people claim is not real and its not it is only an act put on to appease the Capitol people.    Even though there is a fair bit of violence in this novel (Isn't there a lot of violence in this world) there must be some cruelty to make a plot line and to make you think. There must be hundreds of people dying from violence now in this world we live in,  many are children.    There is also a certain reality behind it. I think of the Capitol as America, and the other first world countries, and the districts as the rest of the world. Although we don't have children carted in to our city so we can watch them die as entertainment. There are many children across the world dying from starvation dying from Hunger, as we throw away excessive amounts of food. I enjoyed this book because it made me realize this even if there is not much we can do about it. We, if you think about it, in our own real world play our own Hunger Games.
I did not expect to become so engaged in a "young adult" novel.  This makes me wish I was back in the classroom sharing this novel with students and dissecting all its meaty intricacies.  Collins as done a phenomenal job!
where do i start. Katness Everdeen is in a whole lot trouble. Primrose (her sister) name was selected to fight in the Hunger Games but she volunteers. the rest of the story is action packed and tells you how hard it was for them.
i love the hunger games, they rock i also like the self narration collins has done. all the action seens have vivid discriptions. just the basic storyline is cool. kids my age(around 12) will totally love it , trust me it's sweet
My daughter kept telling me to read the books but I didn't want to submit to the hype. Very good read. How great for our teenage daughters to have a role model who is strong, resourceful, pure, and determined. Highly recommended.
I'd never read YA, but I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised. It took me all of three days to read through it.  The Hunger Games is a sci-fi/fantasy based in an alternative future, told in the first person point of view from the main character, Katniss.  A large war took place that caused America to be broken up into what Collins calls districts. Each district is known for their production value. At one point, a rebellion takes place against the capital. The rebellion is put down and The Hunger Games are created. I don't want to go into too much detail, but they are a way for the capital to maintain control over the districts through fear.  The book is a quick read. Besides being a great story, it's told simply. The characters were unique, each with their own personality based on their roles in society. Collins does an amazing job of world building. Within the first few chapters, the reader feels like they are there. They can feel the despair right along side the characters.  Tension is created right away in the first chapter and you feel it throughout. There really wasn't any point during the story I felt bogged down, or bored. It's one of those books where you feel yourself scrunching your shoulders together. Yet you can't stop because you need to find out what happens next, or if the characters will be okay.  The night I finished, I wanted to keep going. The second book was right there on my Kindle, waiting to be read. I actually had to force myself not to read it. No doubt I will go back and finish it soon, but I had six other books on my to-read list I had to get to.
I enjoyed reading The Hunger Games, because it is a really inspiring book. I recommend it to 10- any older because that's when you really understand it. I think that the hunger games is a 5 star book and I hope you think so too.
Great Book.  Love it so much more than the movie.  Totally recommend reading it :)  I was worried I wouldnt like it since im not a teenager but I still thought it was very entertaining.  Cant wait to read the rest of the series.
Both my sister and my mother recommended The Hunger Games to me. Despite this fact, the book should appeal to both male and female young adults or older. The best part of the book was that Suzanne Collins wrote in such a way that I could truly picture the setting and the characters. The book is about a teenaged girl named Katniss Everdeen who lives at a time after a war has occurred. The government is cruel and wants to keep the people under control. For this reason, the government forces each district in the country to send two tributes to the Hunger Games, which is a fight to the death. The tributes are chosen through a lottery each year. Katniss volunteers to represent her district after her younger sisters name is drawn.   The story follows Katniss throughout her training and ordeal in the Hunger Games arena. Over time, it becomes clear that Katniss is a rebel as she challenges the rules and expectations. For example, when she feels the game makers are not paying attention to her skills, she fires an arrow into their dinner, shocking everyone. The story has a bit of a surprise ending, which I will not reveal here. The ending, however, sets the stage for future books. I rate this book at four and a half stars out of five stars. The only reason I did not give it five full stars is that I did not actually like the ending. I felt it left some gaps that are perhaps addressed in the next book in the series. Despite the ending, I would definitely recommend this book. While it presents a dystopian world, it manages to include some hope that things will change for the better.
As an avid fan of young adult literature, I feel this book is a great example of the potential of this genre and how it can captivate adults just as much as children.  There's a reason "The Hunger Games" is so popular: it's morbidly fascinating, it's taboo, it's gory, it's horrifying, it's uncomfortable. I loved it and I couldn't put it down. I was fascinated by the descriptions of the reapings, the sacrifice (and sometimes the lack of it), the games, the arena, the strategy, the deaths, the humiliation of the interviews, all of it!  The story is pretty original, although it reminded me a little bit of "Lord of the Flies" on some levels, though the circumstances as to how they all got there certainly weren't the same (but still had much the same outcomes, like children killing each other, creating alliances, searching for food, etc.). The pacing was very well done. Character development was good. When I was done, I was satisfied and I wanted more. And the "more" had lots of potential, so I couldn't wait to see where it went.  I would love to see spin-off books that talk about the Hunger Games from the perspective of other players (like the careers or other characters, like Tresh--what was he doing in the fields the whole time?), family members who are watching, Capitol people who are watching, etc.  I am concerned about how the movie will be done and can see them changing many of the circumstances and key points (like making them all older, making deaths less gory) that define "The Hunger Games" to make it more acceptable to moviegoers, which would really be a shame.
I'm not sure where I first heard of this book but I decided it might be worth the read.  I'm glad I bought it.  The story is one that rarely appeals to me.  It has a sort of sci-fi/fantasy feel to it but the writing was what drew me in.  The main character is so believable and memorable.  You can see her change throughout the story and you really understand where she is coming from.  If you have ever read Twilight and thought it was a good book but too wordy and Bella was a little too vulnerable, then you'll love this book.  Katniss is the heroine that people can look up to.  She isn't vulnerable.  On the contrary, she is quite able to defend herself without anyone's help.  It was refreshing for me to have a character that wasn't always needing other people i.e. Harry Potter, Bella.  While the characters are great, the writing is smooth and elegant.  Collins does a wonderful job of making the story believable.  She adds little nuances to the story that make you believe this could actually happen.  At one point she describes hunting.  In it she tells us that Katniss always kills her squirrels with a shot through the eyes.  That information isn't necessary to the story but it makes the whole thing more believable.  The book is fast-paced and full of wonderful plot nuances.  The story isn't just an allegory for the future.  It also is a great survival story similar to "The Most Dangerous Game,"  it has adventure and even a little love triangle.  The story will play with your emotions and leave you ultimately satisfied and anxious for the next addition to the series.
Lately I've been reading several of the classic dystopian novels and wanted to add a few recent ones as well. I added this one to my list and I couldn't be happier that I did.  While the book does have some serious underlying themes - there is more than a little criticism of the current class warfare of the wealthy against the majority of Americans - it is mainly just a great yarn. It starts off a tad slow, for about 20 pages, and then kicks into gear and I was unable to put it down. The book is vaguely predictable, in that some of the major aspects can be anticipated, but this in an unpredictable way. In other words, the book ends pretty much like you expect it will, but with twists that you don't anticipate.  I love Katniss Everdeen, who is a delightful antidote to the appalling Isabella in the horrific TWILIGHT books. Instead of being passive and pathetic, she is self-sufficient, extremely intelligent, and enormously competent. She is one of the more appealing teen female heroes that I have encountered in fiction.  For parents wondering if this book is appropriate for their kids, they will need to make a judgment call. Technically it is a juvenile novel, though in fact I suspect most readers are adults. But it is a pretty violent book with some pretty gruesome scenes, and some of the more graphic moments are particularly nightmarish. But the violence aside, this is a very fine novel, sort of "The Lottery" meets "The Most Dangerous Game." Absolutely everyone who enjoys dystopian novels should definitely give it a read. I believe it will go down as something of a classic.
Collins created characters we can root for and care about. She made the reader even care and feel (some) empathy for the villin characters! The action kept you turning the pages to find out what happened next. A very good read!
I read this book because I tend to try to keep up with my daughter's habits, especially when I hear that teens are killing each other. This book was tastefully done on that account and I can honestly say that it was not gruesome or inappropriate outside of that, although that sounds like enough from the outside. My initial impression was that the concept is imaginative and interesting. The main character goes through some serious challenges that I think would be positive for a teenager to read and process. In particular, the deep struggles Katniss faces in her every day life to survive and maintain normalcy are compelling and reachable for even a young mind. I like this a lot because this is a gap in a lot of American teenagers' ability to process and connect with. The disconnection between her circumstance and the Capitol is very good emphasis of this point. The arena portion is also very solid because of her developed connection to others and trying to cope with death and what she has to do. the portion that is wholly unbelievable in my mind is the level of maturity this character has. As a sixteen year old girl, she is beyond wise and her thought processes are way too mature. This lends itself to unbelievability in my mind in almost every turn of the book. This continues in the following book and really turns me off. It just goes too far and borders on extreme in my opinion. Overall, I liked the story and see why it is so appealing to others in this age range. It is a well thought out concept and story. I do recommend it for those interested or those who saw the movie
Katniss is just trying to do the right thing. She's ethical and hard-working, and just trying to take care of her family. She was the "adult" of the house after her father died and her mother "checked out" of life for awhile. Then comes the day of the Reaping, when the Capitol draws the names of one boy and one girl to represent each district in The Hunger Games.  Katniss has become a second mother to her little sister Prim. There's such a protective tenderness that exists between them. There's a charming moment in the book when the family is getting ready for the Reaping and Katniss says of her little sister "I notice her blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and force myself to stay calm. 'Tuck your tail in, little duck,' I say, smoothing the blouse back in place." (p. 16) I just really found that touching.  I'm afraid to say too much, as I don't want to throw out any spoilers for the handful of people who, like me, haven't yet read this book. But I really enjoyed this story. The book is exciting, with more than a few "on the edge of your seat" moments. There is tension, despair, hope. There are funny moments in Katniss' thinking, such as when she thinks "I can't help feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want to do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit out of his chest hair, and tuck him into bed." (p. 48) The chest hair comment got me!  Now I can't wait to read the sequel Catching Fire! I highly recommend this book for a fun and exciting story with emotional intrigue, and mild enough for teens, but edgy enough for adults. Read it now!
Although I wouldn't call this the worst-written book ever, and I did read it to the end, this opus is best described as decidedly mediocre. The writing style itself is very impoverished, lacking any imagination, flair or originality; it's very utilitarian and straight-forward. It really reads like a movie script project written by a young teenager. The whole setting is very contrived, which would be fine if this were a device or vehicle for something more exciting, but alas, what you see is what you get here. The characters are extremely one-dimensional and uninteresting: lack of any emotional depth is the worst aspect of the writing. The only good part that I almost enjoyed (hence the two stars) is the main battle sequence, which was absorbing enough to bring me to the end of the book, but it isn't nearly enough to tempt me to read a single page of the 2nd book of the trilogy.  I find the high rating of this book particularly depressing, especially considering that so few people still read nowadays on a regular basis. There is more substance, imagination and thought in a single paragraph of most sci-fi or fantasy novels (to say nothing about great works of literature) than in this entire novel. It is very sad that people would waste their time reading this, instead or something more mentally stimulating. ...I just browsed through a few pages of a kindle-only "self-published" work by an unknown author advertized on the amazon homepage, and those few pages have infinitely more emotional and intellectual depth than this entire book (raised my spirits, actually).
Amazing, captivating, a real page turner. These are some of the words I thought of while reading this book. If you were like me, you would read the title and think: "It sounds dumb." Now, this is what I thought. Then the reviews popped in. I ended up reading them and deciding to finally read this so called "Masterpiece" The first chapter was boring to me. But the second pulled me in and grabbed my attention. The book was not at all what I expected. The book is about a 16 year old girl named Katniss Everdeeen who lives in District 12, Panem. The world has come to starvation and lack of resources. The solution? Less population, and entertainment to the Capitol of Panem. The capitol and Panem is ruled by President Snow, the evil genius of the games. 13 [Now 12] District are to send 1 woman and man to compete in the games. They will fight to the death.  Questions About Book:  WHAT IS THE HUINGER GAMES?  The hunger games is a fight to the death in an arena. 24 tributes are to go in. Only one man/woman make it out alive.  WHAT IS IN THE GAMES?  Other teens or children trying to kill you. Animals. Mutations. And other unexpected happenings.  WHO IS KATNISS?  Katniss Everdeen is a 16 year old girl whos father died in a mining explosion. She lives with her mother and her little sister, Primrose. They have a cat named buttercup. Katniss's best friend is Gale Hawthorne. He is also her hunting partner. Katniss and Gale hunt in a forest that is illegal to hunt in. Punishment is death.  AGE RANGE-12+  MAY BE SCARY FOR SOME KIDS. VERY GRAPHIC
If I had to pick just one book that I most enjoyed in 2008, this would probably be it. Now, I have to add the caveat that I read lots of series this year, and it seemed unfair to try to pick one book from a series like Meyers' Twilight books or Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse saga. So Hunger Games did get a little help in that department. But even with that said.... wow. This is just a great book.  In The Hunger Games, Collins creates another one of those dystopian societies that I love so much. In her world, America is no longer. There's been some kind of a big life-changing event that has reduced the nation into 12 disticts, all under totalitarian rule by the Capital. In this world, the people are starving and once a year, young people ages 12-18 are forced to enter their names into a drawing to participate in The Hunger Games, a life-or-death reality show from hell in which the victors are treated to a life of luxury while all the other competitors perish.  Yes, the story is a little familiar. It's reminiscent of The Long Walk or The Running Man by Stephen King, and there's a little bit of Lord of the Flies in here, too. But the characters are well developed and likeable. The dialogue is great. And -- here's the best part -- its only the first book. The story ends with a major cliffhanger that drove me to immediately visit Amazon to figure out how long I had to wait for the next installment. Now that's the sign of a good read. It's destined to become one of the titles I read again and again, if someone buys it for me for Christmas this year. (hint! hint!)
"The Hunger Games" is one of those books that is impossible to resist and you do not want to put down. The premise is irresistible, one of those guilty pleasures, and reminiscent ofBattle Royale. There can be many comparisons drawn between these two books; but, most would fall staggeringly short as the only thing these books really have in common is young children placed in an area where they will kill each other.  What makes "The Hunger Games" a force to be read is the beauty in which the "fantasy world" is built. There is a lot of history in this near post-apocalyptic world, and it is revealed in small doses in perfect increments. The story is woven between the history of the children, the history of the government and ruling class, and the history of the games. Strung throughout the book are engaging characters, intriguing situations, with the common denominator being the wonderfully paced prose.  This was not a book that I could not put down; but, it was a book that I did not want to put down. Finding a book with good pacing is difficult these days. The entire book is not just a buildup to an unexpected and unstoppable climax, but rather chapter after chapter of climax.  Back on the comparison ofBattle Royale, this book does not get bogged down with irrelevant details and countless flashbacks that break up the story. I lovedBattle Royaleand I loved "The Hunger Games." As I said, they really cannot be compared other than the fundamental premise. However, if you liked one, I recommend the other.  J.Stoner
Read this long before the movie was even a thought.  Great series of 3 books with another interesting Dystopian theme.  Well-written and fast-moving, with the usual tenseness of a love relationship that never quite makes it...
I watched the movie first, big mistake! I am so glad that I finally broke down and bought the book! This is by far one of the best stories I have ever read, and I LOVE the fact that I could get the kindle edition on my iPhone.
This book needs no introduction. If you stop being critical, you might find yourself enjoying this breezy read. Definitely aimed at the teen market, it's not life changing but is fun and entertaining. You could do a lot worse.
I don't normally read YA, but I thought the opening pages were so well written that I had to buy it. I was disappointed by the plot turn at the end of the first chapter, though. And I felt the novel as a whole was predictable.
Loved this book. The plot was very well developed and the characters were very interesting.I also watched the movie which was AWESOME! Jennifer Lawrence played Katniss perfectly and Josh Hutcherson was great as Peeta. They had really good casting choices for the characters. They were sort of how I imagined them in the book.  In the beginning, Katniss's sister Prim was chosen for the hunger games in district 12. In order for Katniss to protect her sister, she took her place. The male from district 12 was Peeta Mellark who Katniss has seen before. Katniss had to say bye to he family and her best friend Gale(played by Liam Hemsworth in the movie) before she left her home to compete in the hunger games.  Towards the middle of the story, Katniss and Peeta train for the games before they compete. They know who the bad guys are which is known as the career group. During the games, many people get killed at the bloodbath. The career group survives because they decided to kill the people close to them and the weaker ones. Katniss meets a 12 year old girl named Rue who she became really close friends with. Rue got killed by a boy named Marvelwho was in the career pack. All the other competitors get killed until Katniss and peeta were the last ones. Throughout the games, katniss and peeta form a romantic relationship. Katniss decides not to kill him because she cared about him too much.  At the end, the creators of the games let both of them win. Katniss returns back to district 12 where she reunites with her mom, Prim, and best of all gale
Loved this book.  I am in my 60's and feel in love with the story, characters, and plot.  I would not normally buy a utopian or scifi book.  I couldn't wait to pick it up again or to read the Trilogy.  They are all wonderful.
Another trilogy read and fallen in love with! After I read this book, I quickly ordered the other two (which I also freaking loved!) on my Kindle, because I couldn't wait for them to be shipped. It was the best book marathon!
I loved The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.  I finished it in just two days it was so hard to put down.  Even when I wasn't reading it, I still was thinking about it.  This is the first book in the series and I am hooked!  It takes place in a fictional country called Panem that the Capitol controls which is divided into districts based on industry.  Just to make sure everyone realizes the Capitol is in control, they run annual Hunger Games where they force two teens from each district to enter a competition to fight to the death in a place that the game makers pick on live TV.  Katniss is the main character, a 16-yr-old girl who is a good hunter and who volunteers to take your younger sister's place.  The boy from her district that is also chosen has a long-time crush on her but she does not realize it until he mentions it in his interview.  Katniss struggles with not only surviving the game, but also with friendships and her feelings for Peeta, her admirer and Gale, the boy she hunted with before having to leave for the hunger games.  There is humor in the book as well because Peeta and Katniss both have a rebellious attitude toward the Capitol and work hard at not losing their humanity.  I especially liked when they went through their training for the show.  This book is awesome!  This is a must read if you like psychological thrillers and adventure.  This is one of my all-time favorite books and I look forward to reading the rest of the series!  If you like the TV show, Survivor, you will love The Hunger Games since there are some similarities.
I just re-read this great series.  For those of you who have seen the movie but did not read the books, you are in for a really great surprise. The book is well written with descriptions of people and places that give you a full view of the world you are reading about.  The premise is a corrupt country that use to be the United States but is now "Panem" a country dived into thirteen different sections (the thirteenth area was destroyed in the upraising...that's all i'll say)  and then the capital.  Because of an upraising that occurred seventy years previously, a boy and girl child from the age of 13-18 are picked at random to compete to the death in the Hunger Games. Look through the eyes of Katniss, a sixteen year old girl who volunteers for her sister at the annual Hunger Games reaping. See how she is thrown on into the games and into the world and starts a revolution, although she doesn't  mean to. It is a compelling read that makes you stay up way past your bed time to see what happens next. With a beginning of one of the most complicated love triangles ever witnessed, you will find yourself wondering what you would do in her situation.  To be honest I don't really think it is appropriate for children under the age of 13. I believe that the social markings of the people and the questions of love and taking a life  go above and beyond the whole "young Adult" spectrum. This is a great book, that was made into a not so great movie. So if you liked the movie, you will love the book, and if you love the book, skip the movie! Hope this helps!
The female protagonist checks the color of her urine, but none of the 12 female contestants have their monthly periods. The archery does not take wind into account. Kathiss is an experienced hunter coming from an extra poor region that barely has 2hrs a day of electricity but she still has to learn how to "make fire" right before the Games. The train that can reach 250 mph requires special infrastructure, and why do they need it at all if they use it just a couple times per year? It's much cheaper and easier to put a mini-recorder on a bird than develop a special strain of birds repeating human speech. The mutant wasps are overkill--african killer bees do the job as reliably. You don't shoot rabbits and turkey, you use snares which is much simpler. You don't spend several hours of late morning on a hunt, you spend much longer and go further than a couple of miles. You don't plan Sundays as your weekly hunt day: it's not like grocery shopping at all.  Not to mention that her native forest should've been crawling with amateur hunters and gatherers, with the inevitable consequence of developing racket/protection/territory division/payment for the right to hunt to the various gangs etc.  Oh, and you don't trust a convicted mutulated prisoner that does not have any future of hope with your food. I mean, would you, really?  That's not a complete list of errors, far from it. It's the fact that these errors are so basic made the reading this book so hard for me. The author could've made just a little bit of research to avoid them.
This book completely sucked me in from page one and barely allowed me to come up for air.  It is so fast-paced that there's hardly anywhere to pause to, say, go to sleep for the night or go to work for the day. Needless to say, I read it very rapidly despite working quite full days.  I probably can't say anything others haven't already said or that most people at this point don't already know, but I still wanted to put my voice out there strongly recommending this series. It is indeed brutal and if you can't handle violence involving children (like my mother, who's the one who gave it to me to begin with), it's likely not for you. But that said, it is a fascinating view of a dystopian futuristic society and a girl unwittingly stirring rebellion.  Katniss herself is likable while at the same time being very unsentimental, which I usually don't like. That was a nice surprise, to like her anyway. The other characters are similarly great and multi-dimensional. I liked the hints to a love story that begin in this first book. I can't WAIT to see the movie version as it's looks like they're doing a good job with it.  Prior to starting this series, I had the assumption that the Hunger Games themselves would run the course of all three books. By the end of the first book I was left, like many I know of, wondering what on Earth the remaining two books would be about. Let's just say you'll have to find out for yourself - enjoy the ride!  (Just don't start reading it if you're going to have to put it down any time soon!)  ;)
Right when I read the cover I knew this was going to be an amazing book. Hunger Games is about this country that was divided into 13 districts until they blew up district 13 because of problems adn every year they have an annual hunger game challenge, they choose one girl and one boy from every district. During a reaping to pick the one boy and one girl from every distric Katniss's younger sister, Prim was chosen. But Katniss took her spot because she didnt want ther sister to die. Okay now that i have told you what it is sorta about I will give you my take on this book. In the first part of the book it was a struggle for me to read because it was so boring. When I got to the second part of the book, man was i blown away, during the reality part of the show aguy named Prim pretended thata he was madly in love with this hairy beast who had to be shaved before to look not like a monster. Wow, there is so much detail I almost hopped into the book. Like a kid spitting blood onto her face and it can get pretty gory. The book is written in first person that I liked and disliked because you can not jump from people to people and you just have to stay with Katniss the whole time. I hated the ending to this book because it didn't make me want to read the next book, Catching Fire. They say they are making a movie but if they make this PG-13 they would have to take away a lot of the book so don't be surprised if the movie is going to be rated R. Overall this book is a really good book I would recommend this for teens and adults 'cause it can get very descriptive.
What an adventure! The Hunger Games is a great young adult, futuristic, dystopian novel that makes you think hard about what you would do in a situation similar to Katniss Everdeen's. Read my full non-spoiler review at [...]
Reading The Hunger Games is highly recommended for any teen. It is a fast paced novel that is filled with suspense, drama, and action. I enjoyed this book for several reasons. First of all, the characters are well developed by Suzanne Collins. Katniss is a fierce and loyal main character. The reader grows to admire her throughout the book. The setting paints a vivid picture in the reader's mind. You are able to imagine that you have stepped into the hunger game arena. Also, the nonstop action keeps the reader's attention during the entire book.  The characters in this book are memorable. It is like Katniss, Gale, and Peeta become real people as you read. The author takes you into battle with Katniss and Peeta. You find yourself cheering for and against other characters in the book. The action continues to keep you guessing until the very end. That is part of the reason why this book is so engaging.  Suzanne Collins creates a futuristic society in this book. The country is divided into several different districts. Katniss is from a district that is very poor. However, as she grows up there, she learns to hunt animals to feed her family. When she goes into the arena, these hunting skills become a valuable part of her will to survive the hunger games.  At the end of The Hunger Games, the reader is compelled to get the next two books in this series. You cannot just stop with the first book. I am excited to read the second book to find out what happens to these remarkable characters. Suzanne Collins makes this book interesting for teens and adults.
This book was a fast read! After it arrived, I was not able to put the book donw and finished it in 3 days, and I am not a fast reader. The story, plaot with twist and page-turning excitment kept me glued to the final page!
I really enjoyed this whole series. The plot is original and very creative. Very developed characters. However I would like to ask about the name choice. But other than that, this book, the whole series, are excelent reads.
I watched the movie before I read the book.  I found the movie to be very vague and lifeless in a way. The actors were not that good, and showed little emotion. Overall, it seemed more like a TV movie than a blockbuster movie.  A fan of Young Adult books, I decided to read the book, knowing that the books shed more insight on the characters.  I was right, but there still was very little emotion in the book itself as far as characters. What emotion it did have was shallow.  Where the book really shines is the whole gladiator thing, along with the taboo of kids fightening kids.  It has been done before, sure, but it is still fun. Sadly, the good part with the action only takes up maybe 10% of the book which is at the end.  Until then, you have to deal with Katniss and her weird emotions.  To be a high profile book, there were many grammer and spelling errors. I would expect from a new author.  As harsh as I may sound, I did enjoy the book (And series) for what it was. There is just something about the theme and the taboo that pulls you in.  As far as other books that I recommend, it would be Sky of Dust: The Last Weapon if you want the same feel as Hunger Games. Gritty, set in the future, and kids surviving the government.  Sky of Dust: The Last Weapon  If you want something a bit more fantasy, then Percy Jack series is good as well.  The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians)
I have read the stereotypical young adult novels like Harry Potter, Twilight, Riordan series, etc. nd kept putting this on off over and over again thjnking What else is there to be written? surely after the hundreds of other books all there was to be original is probably used numerous time and this is some mixmatch vampire zombie wanna be bok that is most ljkely jusst a rewrite of another book. Boy was i wrong!  I loved this book more than any other tht i had read before and thouhtthe them and originality was mind blowing. She dveloped emotions that were so powerful i was literally sucked into the book and couldnt get out for hours at a time. In my opinion, i wouldnt have don he story in Katniss's POV or would have made her character more interesting and unique. But kudos fo reviving this world tha is just dripping with cheesy teen dramas.  I took off a star because i thouh that she couldve made th other tributes a littl more expressive in the book. I know it was a game to see which person would com out alive out of 23 others, but she could have made them talk more or express unique feelings tha placed each of the players apart. I also hink tha instead of using one persons point of view she couldve made it first person omniscient or head hopped so hat we ould understand the story better.  I lik te way tha she had peeta be soomewhat of an enigma at the beginning then have him just pour out at the end. I hope tha peeta gets katniss inhhe end.  P.S.  Sorry for the typos... its hard typing on your kindle!!
Having read many of the reviews here and elsewhere (both favorable and unfavorable) I decided to read this book before seeing the movie adaptation. Set in the U.S of the future after a breakdown in society by war, famine and more wars, there exists 12 districts that are basically slave states supporting a populace living in the Capital who have everything. Elsewhere the people struggle to survive with limited supplies. In order to remind the districts how powerful the Capital really is, Hunger Games or a reality TV , real life survivor contest is held annually. A teenage boy and girl chosen from each district (24 total contestants) battle it out in a large arena that can consist of varying terrain, weapons and food sources. Only one can win! Our heroine is a tough girl who breaks the rules to keep her family alive in normal circumstances. She volunteers to play in the games so that her younger sister will not have to go. She is a martyr. She owes the boy from her district who kept her alive because he loves her. This is a love story with a "Lord of the Flies" type macabre social commentary on TV and power gone amok. Yes there is violence as the contestants must fight and kill each other. But the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. For the most part it is a love story with more of the answers in the next and final books.  I loved it. Could not put it down. Read this in one weekend and rushed out to get the next book. A must read!  Sam Hendricks, author Fantasy Football Guidebook and Fantasy Baseball for Beginners
When I first began this book my initial thought was, "So, this is basically Battle Royale but more for females?" A friend asked me if that made it better or worse than Battle Royale, which is a novel (not the movie, not the manga, THE NOVEL) that I love almost above all others.  It was not fair for me to assess it at the time, and now it is stuck in comparison-dom, but not as much as I thought it would be.  Same general idea, sure.  But oddly with a less helpless feel to The Hunger Games.  This novel never left me terribly surprised by anything but it left me feeling satisfied.  The story was good, the games were well told, and this novel itself did not try to do more than it had time for.  It simply allowed the story to be told the way it should have.  Katniss, the protagonist, is actually unlikable in a lot of ways, which makes her a more realistic character.  She is a good person caught in a bad situation but she has qualities that make her a more likely candidate to survive a game such as this.  Every character is realistic and they fit in the situation they are thrown in.  While I preferred Battle Royale, it had more emotion and a larger array of characters, I still had to throw this novel five stars because the characters who were chosen for the games were more realistic while still being varied and the plot itself was compelling.  That is not even to speak on the splendorous writing style that had me sitting down and having to finish most of this book in one sitting. I'm not usually that type of reader, even with as much as I read.
I loved this book, I couldn't get my eyes off of it, it was like a drug; very addicted. My friend went to see the movie and told me about it, she also told me that it came from a book. And as I am a bookworm I bought it. Ok, I started to read, it talked about this girl, Katniss Everdeen, and how she lives. And then I get to the part of the reaping and I was thinking "Oh no, oh my god, she's gonna pick Katniss,noo!" But then, poof "Primrose Everdeen!" KATNISS' SISSTER!!!!!!!!!NOOOOOOO!!! It totally broke my heart when Katniss said she wanted to be a tribute and then told her lil sis. that she had to be strong.  What I loved of this book is that is has feelings, not like other books that narrate you a story but that in the second page you want to leave because you think "God, dis book's boring". But that doesn't happens with this book, you just want to keep reading and reading, addicted. So when I finished I bought the second and the third because I NEEDED to know how it ended. This book is amazing, it has love, action, suspense...There are ,literally, heartbreaking scenes like when Rue died  I strongly recommend you to read this amazing trilogy, then of course you can watch the movie that is also thrilling. And if you don't like to read, then watch the movie, but the book is like 100.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 (I don't have a clue what's dis number name is but, you understand my point) times better than the movie. So if you're a bookworm like me...READ THE HUNGER GAMES!!!  Kisses  AnonymousReader ;)
With all the hype, I actually expected not to like this book.  I thought it would be like the Twilight series which was too ridiculous for me.  Instead, I found myself hooked from the first few pages.  I read all three of these books in 2 weeks.  This book made me think about the possibility of a world like Panem, and even worse, about the reality of places where Panem-like states truly exist.  I could understand why the main character, Katniss Everdeen, had qualities of being a fighter and also struggled to make choices or value herself.  I am a psychologist, and I see girls like her everyday.  Girls who have been raised in traumatizing environments who wanted to fight, but didn't know how.  I see how the fight is still there, but they aren't sure how to direct it.  Unfortunately, it often leads to self-sabotoge.  I think that happens with Katniss too.  I love Collins' characters.  Her writing style allowed me to really get to know each character, to see their flaws and their attributes.  She is able to weave the story in such a way that kept me hooked.  I can't remember the last book that I actually finished and ran to get the next and the next.  I have seen many reviews here that really made no sense to me.  Many people arguing about whether or not the story line is plausible, is Katniss Everdeen likable, that the writing is fragmented, etc.  I am not sure what the authors of most of those reviews were talking about.  I would strongly recommend this book to teenagers and adults.  Read a sample, I think you'll agree.
After seeing the movies, and all of the hype about the book, I must say I am pleasantly surprised. So surprised that I read most of the book in a day. Fast paced and keeps you anticipating what happens next the whole time.
Rating: 5/5  Review:    This book came highly recommended to me by basically everyone. It would not have been a book I'd pick out for myself; the cover didn't intrigue me, and just by that I wouldn't have even considered reading the back of the book to get more info. If it had been just a random book in a bookstore, I'd have passed it by without an extra thought.    But this is no ordinary book; not even close. With all they hype and great reviews about it, I was interested. And when it came to my school's library, it was so easy to get my hands on it. And when I did, I was not disappointed.    This was an extremely gripping story. Futuristic, scarily so. While extreme critics find other books or movies to compare this one to, I can think of nothing that compares. The story is definitely different from anything I've ever read. Killing people for sport is not a subject that I find gracing the pages of young adult literature. But here it is, plain as day. Perhaps it's a comment on society and the way things are shaping up to be, or perhaps it was just a hypothetical story meant to entertain and keep readers on the edge of their seat. Whichever the case may be, I was enthralled. And it really got me thinking about people, and just goodness overall.    The writing wasn't my favorite; it actually kind of bothered me in parts, the way that Katniss spoke in her narration. But the story fully made up for it.    I'm not sure exactly how the sequel will turn out... but you can bet that I'll be ready for it when it's released.
People have been accusing Suzanne Collins of plagiarizing Battle Royale and that is not true (Well at least to the extent of the law) but its true that she copied too many aspects of Battle Royale and it's most likely that she westernized the idea of Battle Royale in an attempt the reach the large and profitable American market. Hunger Games fans don't want to realize that the book they adore so much is actually a sloppy rehashed Battle Royale simply because of its origin or for other petty reasons. They either quickly dismiss Battle Royale or read it with a heavy bias and ignore the very substance of the book that Collins tries so hard to imitate. I'm not going to elaborate on the similarities between the two books but its clear that Battle Royale solidified the popularity of this genre and its identity has unique elements which separates itself from the rest of the works and puts it at the forefront. Although Battle Royale may have been influenced by earlier novels like "Running Man" or "The Survivor" (The Running Man movie also flopped) they differentiate enough in substance especially compared to The Hunger Games. The success of previous works relating to this genre pale in comparison to Battle Royale and it redefined this genre plenty enough to legitimatize it. Collins definitely did very well for herself as an unoriginal children's book author but looked elsewhere for success after her Underworld Chronicles series. Overall I would not recommend this book or the movie and the American public should wise up and discourage writers from this practice.
Okay, so I wasn't expecting to really like the book, and it's not that this isn't the sort of thing I like to read...in fact , it is. But I'm always wary of such huge cultural phenomena such as this series. Sometimes, though, there really IS a reason why a book like this gets over 13,000 reviews - most of which are really positive.  I went ahead and bought it used because it was only $0.99 at a Goodwill and Stephen King endorsed it. That may have been the best buck I've spent in a long time.  First, the characters are well drawn. I like the first person perspective from Katniss because it lends a dimension of relationship to the reader that, true has been used well in other books (See:A Ghost of Fire (Ghostly Elements)), but I think it's one of the reasons THIS book has done so well.  Second, there's good tension and suspense without relying too much on the horror of what's actually happening (i.e. the bloody deaths of teenaged children). The book is paced really well and the tension builds and you really do end up fretting over whether certain characters are going to make it through the book or not.  Third, it's an easy read. The language isn't clunky and it doesn't get in the way. Collins tells the story very simply without going overboard on description, or making the emotions melodramatic.  Overall, I give it 4 stars because it's earned them. It's not the most amazing thing I've ever read, but it DOES make me want to jump right into Catching Fire. Happy reading.
I was intrigued by the Hunger Games. I kept seeing it on bookstores' shelves, and was wondering if a new trilogy could outperform recent, successful ones. Mixed reviews kept fuelling my interest. My verdict: very good. Fast-paced, well written, engaging, unusual, smart, and... bloody. I am in between two minds about the bloody aspect of the novel, which is usually put on the young adult shelves. Thinking about it, I wouldn't be very keen on my children reading it until they are old enough. True, some of what they watch and read nowadays is almost worse than this. The premise of the novel is a game organised by a Government built on the remnants of what used to be the USA, featuring a group of children of all ages brought together in a large fenced area, and asked to fight to death with each other until there is only one last, successful fighter. The game is filmed: reality TV at its worst. I have a problem with premises featuring children killing each other for pleasure (not that those in the book really want to kill each other to start with); you just don't want those ideas in our children's minds. But then again, this is fiction. I loved "Lord of the Flies" by William Golding, a terrible story about children stuck on a remote island and starting to kill each other, but the premise was different (a reenactment of society, not a game) and it was really an adult book at the end of the day. Having said that, I really liked the Hunger Games. It think it is innovative, clever and has a great plot. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.
The Hunger Games is one of those timeless books that will stay with you forever. In some ways, it is reminiscent of The Lottery combined with a modern-day reality show similar to Survivor. It's a talented author who can describe starvation in such a way the reader feels like they have endured famine...who can build life-threatening events with such reality the reader's heart pounds while hormones of anxiety course through their veins...who can make the reader fall into heartwarming love at the same moment the book's characters do...who can make you mourn - with real tears - when great characters die. Suzanne Collins is just such author. Amazing. Inspiring. One of the greatest.  Katniss' selflessness and willingness to give her life for others along with her morals/ethics make her the perfect heroine. Katniss' tales describing her friendship with Gale and their likenesses means there is no way to ignore the strength of their bond and makes you wonder if she unknowingly loves him. Peeta's tender show of unrequited love makes the reader's heart squeeze, and they cheer for him as emphatically as they pull for Katniss to be the winner of the Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games and the Capital and the Districts. The world which was created within the covers of this book is very real, making this unbelievable story suddenly plausible and horrific.  I would highly recommend this book for people of all ages. In fact, I'm dying to tackle Catching Fire, which will be one of my next books.  T. R. Graves, author
five star rating because I love the hunger games I was so shocked to find out that peeta got a new leg and katniss saved him. I have seen the movie five times and I cant wait to read the next book and see the second movie
I chose this rating because the plot was easy to follow and it was quite descriptive.  I enjoyed the book, for the same reasons as the rating.  I would recommend this book for anyone who likes suspense and action.
The Hunger Games is a riveting book. It was hard to put down, and it set my mood for days, from the moment that I began reading. The problem was that the mood it put me was sordid and dark.  I knew what was coming, as I had seen the movie trailers. I had decided that I would not see the movie, but when the opportunity came along to read the book, I decided to read it despite my doubts about the content. I am not sorry that I read it - it is a well written SF novel, and I would recommend it, with caution.  The book takes place in the what we know of as the United States, although the area is referred to only as North America. But the country is ruled by a dictatorship that resembles the cruelest regimes of human history. The government exercises cruelty for its own sake, pitting neighbor against neighbor, family members against each other, and of course total strangers. People live at a subsistence level; death by starvation is common although the rulers have plenty and enjoy all sorts of luxuries, including slaves.  The main story line is about the Hunger Games, where twenty four children aged twelve to eighteen must fight each other to death. The condition of the "Games" enforces starvation,, thirst, sickness and bloodthirsty violence. Only the last survivor may return home to enjoy the status of a rich outcast in his or her community.  I won't say how this works out, but there is no happy ending in this volume. I have not read the next two books in the series, and I probably won't.
(I address all three books in the trilogy, because I doubt anybody will stop after this first book.)  First two books draw you into a constant fight for survival, with intriguing dynamics of personal relations: enemies, allies, friends. This dynamics is what I liked most in the book, I think the author did a great job making you feel it and empathize. The adventure is engaging when reading, although somewhat falls apart in retrospective (the author leaves loose ends and does not really connect some events or show their consequences, even for important ones).  The last books is different. Major action happens in the background, and you do not really see it, just learn the brief news. Most of the time you are tracking conditions of mental hospital patients, going back and forth in their madness. And their conditions do not really feel only violence-induced, they are heavily intermingled with psychological complexes from ordinary life, hurt feelings, hurt consciousness. There are a few episodes of really engaging action, but they fall apart and fail to connect into a coherent picture even more than in the first two books. It seems the author is piling up events just to put her heroes through something, and then let them analyze this.  General impression: I enjoyed the book while reading, but it feels very incoherent and somewhat disappointing after I finished it. The story falls apart and is so unconvincing, that it fails to lead you into retrospective thinking, like most good books do. I did like the friend-enemy dynamics.
I finally broke down and read Hunger Games a few months after I ordered it.  I do not regret the purchase but there is no way that I would let any child under 16 read it.  The violence is pretty shocking and the only thing keeping the publisher from listing this as an adult read is that there is no sexual content in it.  I would have liked the author to have given just a little more background on the districts and the capital but you had to pick up what little she gave you fast because once the games begin, it is pretty brutal.  All in all, I admired the premise of the story but it was a little hard to understand that these games could even exist.  This it where it would have been nice to have more of a history of the circumstances that brought the games to life and the reasons that parents accepted that 23 of their children would die every year in a fight to the death.  I get that there was an uprising but why did the hunger games appear out of that.  Keeping the districts starving and captive not enough?  Taking all their resources not enough?  The writer just did not give enough of a background to make this believable.  I found it hard to accept that all the residents of the capital would tolerate these games for as long as they have. Fear only keeps us captive for so long.  These games have gone on for a long time.  P.S. If you are committed to reading the trilogy, do not read the reviews for the final book in the series.  The reviews were mixed and many were quite harsh.  Alot of spoilers as well.
The Hunger Games is one of the most thrilling and intense books i've read in a while. For those who love Harry Potter and Twilight, I guarantee that you will want to make room on your bookshelf for this book as well. Suzanne Collins used every ingredient that creates a fun and entertaining read for all. The book immediately starts in with Katniss Everdeen and her family, consisting of her mother and sister, on what is a normal day in District 12. Within the first few pages, you feel for Katniss and what she's been through. She basically has to provide for her family since her father died and her mother won't do a thing to lessen the suffering of her children.  As for The Hunger Games themself, it IS slightly violent. Therefore, I would not let your young children read it until you, the parent, have read it first.  The other aspect of the book is the love story between Katniss and Peeta Mellark. Peeta has loved Katniss since they were just small children and Katniss has been completely oblivious to the whole thing. She has only known his as "the boy with the bread", who saved her and her family from starvation just after her father died. The love story progresses during the Games, but Katniss still doesn't really believe that what Peeta says and does is actually true! And of course, we don't really find out what happens between them when the book comes to a close:( Oh well, it just leaves me "hungry" for more;)  The Hunger Games is a must read and I think that you will be just as eager for the second installment as I am!
The story has taken me places I never would have imagined. It has caused me to look at the human psyche in a whole new light. The book and its series is nothing short of brilliant. Susan Collins has quite an imagination.
When I first ordered the Hunger Games, I was under the impression that it would be loosely based on the TV ratings war between several reality/competition style cooking programs. Think MasterChef, Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Swear Word, or Survivor: Cannibal Island.  Once the potential death of an impossibly resilient teen protagonist entered the frame, however, I began to suspect that I would learn hardly anything about good quality food, or why it is impossible to be a chef without being nasty and horrible to your staff or understudies.  Once the competitors in this deathly olympiad were taken to the capital to prepare, my faith was restored, for they were served slow cooked lamb, made in a tajine, with prunes and vegetables...a perfect dish for a winter's eve, which it turns out seasonally describes the eves we are currently enduring here in Sydney.  The result was that my girlfriend, a real up and comer in the kitchen, a former contestant on 'Survivor: Hassle Free Greek Island Holiday'; and lover of tween romance literature; took it upon herself to reproduce the meal in question. I consumed the meal hungrily, relaxing in the knowledge that afterwards I would be consuming dessert, rather than being pitted in a kill or be killed type scenario. Seriously, would you want a gutful of slow cooked meat if you were about to fight for your own survival?  For all the above reasons, and many more, I give Hunger Games 4 stars and can safely say it is the best book I never read...apart from thousands of classics.
The Hunger Games is a worldwide phenomenon. It went from book(s) to a movie in a split second. I actually saw the movie first and then I went and read the book. I was a bit skeptical about the book being the same as the movie, but I was wrong, it was better. I finished the first book the same day I got it and then went back and got the second and third book. I was expecting the first book to be a bit overwhelming after I had seen the movie. I was wondering how Suzanne Collins would be able to obtain all of the action of the movie and put it into words and still make it have the same affect. She did it perfectly. Every part of the book balanced out and led easily into another action part without any confusion. Some books I've read have had action in them and the authors have not been able to do the same thing with their words. The words they use to describe the characters and what's happening are confusing to me and I can't imagine it in my head very well, but with The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins mastered the action and with one great work, her books are forever on my bookshelf.   I won't give away too much about the book, but basically it's about 24 teenagers who are admitted into an arena and made to fight to the death until on lone person remains. This book is about survival and about how fighting for your life is very frightening and difficult, especially when 23 other people are aimed to kill you. I definitely  recommend this book to everyone who is thinking about reading it. Once you start, it's hard to stop.
The Hunger Games is one of the best books I have read next to Harry Potter.  This book is set in the future in North America, there are 12 districts.!(There were 13 but that district was destroyed) Every year they randomly pick 2 people as tribunes(a boy and a girl).Prim Everdeen(Katniss' sister has her name in for a tribune only 1 time so Katniss' is almost sure she wont get picked. When the ceramony begins ,girls are picked first, Prim is picked,but Katniss volenters as tribune in place of her sister, The boys are picked next,and its Peeta Mellark,the bakers son.  Katniss goes into training with her 2 mentors:Effie Trinket and a guy named Haymitch. For the next couple of days the tribunes train for the games. Then when the games begin the 24 tribunes all die 1 by 1. Then left last to win are Katniss and Peeta. Who by then are really in love! But Katniss isn't sure if she likes him or her best friend Gale Hawthorne at home who is her hunting partner.  The Hunger Games is to teach the people in the districts not to repelled against the capitol so they are sacrificing kids from the ages 12-18 to fight for the death,and everybody in all of the capitols will be watching them!  I loved the Hunger Games and I cant wait till I read the next two books in the series: Catching Fire and Mockingjay.  This book has a lot of details it goes very well into explanation about things. If you are to go see the movie I would recommend you to read the book first because you might seem a little confused at the movies.
Hunger Games is one of the hottest books on the market right now.  It's the story of a ruined, post-apocalyptic society in which north America is divided into twelve sectors and a somewhat fascist government is in place.  To control the population, each year two children are chosen from each district and the twenty-four contestants are forced to fight to the death.    This is a seriously addicting and fascinating book.  The writing is sharp and engaging, and the reader can't help but rout for our strong, quirky heroine, who tells the story in the first person.  She has all kinds of knowledge about the bleak realities of her world, and all kinds of ignorance about things like trust and romantic love.  I read this book in only a few days because I simply couldn't put it down.  The brutality, side by side with the ignorance and innocence is a seductive combination.    I hear talk of Hollywood snapping this one up.  They want to target teens with it, as it's a young adult book, but from what I know of ratings, that doesn't seem likely.  Any time there is violence against children--especially done by other children--and it results in death, is an automatic R-rating.  And let me just warn you, some of the stuff in this book is pretty brutal.    The off-kilter savagery, juxtaposed with moments of tenderness, is just enough to keep the reader turning the pages, and shows the author's ingenuity at her craft.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to read outside the box.  Just don't expect a Walt Disney film.  [...]
I have seen the movie a few times, but reading this book gives more insight into the conflicting emotions, how things are in the district, sand how frivolous and pampered the people are in the capital. Magnificent read.
Very forceful page-turner, a very fun read, but also ridiculous in some ways. The central statement/theme is that its bad for the powerful to exploit their subjects by making them fight to the death. OK, but then isnt that the exact reason why we keep turning the pages, to see who dies next? Isnt all the exciting violence the reason this book sold so well? Yes, making the reader care about the characters is important, but without the carnage it would have been painfully obvious how two-dimensional they all are. A sick game makes sick people want to watch, and sick readers want to read, because we are all members of a sick race that craves to see suffering and destruction. Plot-wise it was pretty slick but I thought there should have been at least a few earlier subjects who refused to fight. The author (or editor, whose touch is detectible) is also careful to display Katniss open adoration of expensive clothes and fine food: mustnt have an American book that even hints that these are bad things. Theres a balancing act going on here between condemnation of the upper classes and open longing for the finer things in life. Another area in which the author is clever is having super-tough heroine Katniss get to be gleefully decked out in fancy dresses and makeup several times. Ladies get to have their cake and eat it too: woodsy tom-boy gets timeouts to go all girly-girl. She even gets to dump the boy who loves her. After all, shes got another boy back home whos better looking. Yay! I like, totally love this book!
Partly it's the narrator--she does the Women's Murder Club series (by James Patterson) well, but her voice is a bit old to be a convincing Katniss--but mostly it's Katniss herself. I'm not completely sold on her as the heroine. She was amazingly dense at times, particularly about her relationships with others, and especially with boys. I realize that this is the trend in YA fiction these days--to have plain, nothing-special girls who just don't realize that a boy (let alone more than one! We should all be so lucky) could possibly like them and be totally in the dark about it, but Katniss took it to a whole new level. Can she really be that oblivious? Since we're getting the story from her POV here, I guess so. I find it hard to swallow, though, because overall she's not an idiot. (She just plays one on reality TV? Sorry, couldn't resist.) Yes, she was good at using what life threw at her to help her get through and yes, overall she showed resourcefulness and bravery. But unless she undergoes some major changes in the next two books (because in this one? She didn't really change at all), she's never going to be in the list of my favorite heroines.  Another thing that bothered me is that we don't really get a good explanation for what has happened to the country that turned it into the scary place that is Panem. Things are alluded to but never fully explained--or at least not explained in a way that makes it all make sense. Maybe this will be fixed in the next two books? I hope so, but won't be holding my breath....
I think that The Hunger Games is a great book. In fact I'm holding back the best I can to not go ahead and read the other two books in the series because I have to remember THIS book, The Hunger Games in order to write this review accurately for this school report.  The Hunger Games is extremely addictive, in almost every review people talk about how they couldn't put it down, with good reason. It is non-stop action, you're constantly at the edge of your seat waiting for the next big unexpected thing to happen.  The Hunger Games is suspenseful. For example, 24 teenagers are put in an arena to fight to the death, keep in mind that they are TEENAGERS, so they're young and unpredictable and they are fighting to the death, so their decisions might be a little off.  The Hunger Games has something for everyone, adventure, a tiny bit of horror, action, suspense, romance, drama, and even a little humor. (This is on the back, I don't want to give too much away) From things like "Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the games." To other points of the story line like "If she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love."  If I had to make up one quote up for this incredibly great book it would be:  "The entire book is climax."  All my friends told me that this book, along with the rest of the series, is great. Now having read the book, I agree. Top 5 material.
Alright so starting out this is a very good Sci-Fi book. It is centered in North America, old USA. I predict the book is about 100 years after present time. The Hunger Games is an event done yearly to punish rebels and remind them that the Capitol is stronger. What they do is have each District send forth one boy and one girl decided upon by draw. The Tributes are then sent into an arena to fight to the death. The reason they do this is because 75 years ago the Districts had a rebellion against the Capitol. The Hunger Games is basically the Capitol's way of saying "We're still bigger and stronger than you".    What does Katniss do in the book? Good question. I will answer this after I tell you SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!! Katniss's sister gets her name drawn and she instantly volunteers to go up instead. Everyone is so stunned at the thought of it that no-one says a word. Anyone from District 12 basically knows that going into the Games is a certain death sentence. Katniss doesn't care though,  she wants to save her sister. I won't go deeper into the plot because I don't want to spoil it for anyone reading this.    Conclusion- EPIC BOOK. The author's purpose is to entertain, and boy was I entertained! I didn't find any moral but then again I have trouble finding morals in anything. I recommend it because it's a great read and can get a bit emotional, but not too much. If you read this book be prepared for chills down your spine and you will frequently block out the world around you.
I purchased the Hunger Games Trilogy for my Kindle quite a while ago.  Life got busy and I had several other books in my que to read.  I should have skipped them all.  This was the best book I have read in a long time.
Very well written book.Holds your intrest from the first word to the last. I have only read this first one, but will most certainly read the rest. I am even thinking about going to the movie, which is different for me.
A couple months ago, I hadn't even heard of The Hunger Games. Now, I'm happily immersed in it. My girlfriend and her teenage kids were in various stages of reading the trilogy, and they introduced me to the story. When her 13-year-old son tried describing the plot to me, I became minimally interested. Then I picked up the first book. Wham! Suzanne Collins' story hooked me. I've read the first two books, and I've seen the movie. I can hardly wait to read the third.  I had just finished The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo when I picked up The Hunger Games. I loved the suspense of Dragon Tattoo, and I was equally impressed with the gripping story of The Hunger Games. The story gets even better with the second book.  Another novel I finished recently that compares favorably to Hunger Games and Dragon Tattoo isThe Kurchatov Penetration, a thriller about the Russian mafiya's efforts to steal and smuggle plutonium to feed the ravenous nuclear appetite of the Islamic Republic of Iran with the assistance of teenage American computer hacker Kent Dalton. Dalton has the brilliance of Tattoo's Salander character, but otherwise is quite different and unique. Also, with Iran's nuclear ambitions and Israel's sabotage of their nuclear program in the news almost daily, it seems that The Kurchatov Penetration could be closer to reality than fiction. It's a scary to think how near to the edge of a nuclear holocaust we ride. The Kurchatov Penetration is a real eye-opener and exciting page-turner.
This is the first in a series of books by Suzanne Collins. I was recommended this read by a dear friend and family member. I was so impressed by this read. I haven't been this excited about a series since Twilight. LOL.  The Hunger Games is set in North America where there are 12 colonies. There were 13, but they rebelled and are non existent. The main character and protagonist Katniss is a 16 year old girl. She is a illegal hunter in her district, feeding her family in a very poverty stricken district.  The Capital is a what we as Americans would call The Man... Or a communist government set up in a place that all their needs are meet while a dying people suffer and try and fend for themselves.  There was a rebellion in the colonies between them and the Capital. So, in their peace treaty The Hunger Games where birthed. The Hunger Games is a form of punishment and a way for the Capitol to remind the people that they are in control. Each year at the same time one boy and one girl from all twelve districts are chosen to participate in a yearly competition to the death. It is done by lottery for children ages 12-18.  There is also a few love interests in the story. Katniss is torn between her best friend and another companion along her journey's. A romance that always leaves the reading wondering.  I hope everyone I know reads this, not just for the excitement in reading such a great story. But, also for us to remember what all we have and how great we have it here in our country right at this moment.
When I bought it, I wasn't aware that it was a book targeted at younger audiences (at least it seems to be).  The main characters are 12-18 years old and while the plot is fairly interesting the characters are pretty black and white ... you know who's good and who's bad in the same way as in most Harry Potter books.  The characters are nowhere near as interesting or ambivalent as lets say in Game of Thrones, nor do the plot or the characters take any surprising twists or turns.  I'd say it's popcorn fiction. The book does by no means come anywhere near R.R.Martin's books (Game of Thrones) or books written by William Gibson ... neither in complexity/atmosphere nor in their tendency to surprise.  But it is still fairly well written and an easy entertaining read and it has its good moments. Certainly suitable for most teenagers.  Essentially I'm sure, people who are fine with Harry Potter books, will like this one too.  Also, if you saw the movie, there's still something for you in the book.  I saw the movie later and found many scenes in the movie which I would not have understood without the book. Naturally a few plot parts were missing from the movie too. So I imagine reading the book after the movie will still have some good moments.  If you're still not sure if you should read it, click on the 1-star reviews and sort for most helpful first.  The one by "Alex" sums up the weak part nicely, although personally I think the overall rating is overly critical and harsh.
Joshua Stewart  Period #1  AP Language and Composition  April 29, 2012  The Hunger Games  By: Suzanne Collins  Great book to read and good story to follow when reading, April 29, 2012  Most of the books I have read had to do with fantasy, historical fiction, and non-fiction that provided a great story to develop. When I first heard about this book and movie, I actually was actually convinced when I saw it and I wanted to read it. Suzanne Collins put some great effort into this book and it actually gives great detail of the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, and what is happening around her in the story. Collins uses mostly 1st person so that she can get the reader to think that Katniss is telling the story to them. What mainly happens in this story is that there is a tradition (Hunger Games) that occurs every year to gather 2 children (male and female age 12-18) from every 13 districts to fight to the death for victory and honor for their district filled with poverty. This story provides a great plot of the action, suspense, and the climax, but this book does lack some tone in it. I think this is a good book to read and that it would be great to continue reading the series for the suspense and for what is going to happen to the protagonist and the hunger games. The audience intended for this book would be mostly young readers who are into fiction, suspense, and has a good plot to it. I would consider that people should read this for a good story, but for a lack of tone quality.
I tried.  I really, really tried.  I tried to read the entire book.  But by page 100-something I was so bored with slogging through Collins' sophomoronic (yes, you read that right) prose that I tossed the book into the round file, after which I fished it out and donated it to our co-op's bookshelf in the laundrymat.  Someone might find it useful for killing time between the wash cycle and the spin cycle.  The writing in "The Hunger Games" is from hunger.  Even Stephenie Meyer writes better than this, and that is saying a lot.  Page after page of vapid descriptions that tell us essentially nothing.  We know there's going to be blood and gore all over the floor at some point but before you're halfway there you wonder if it's worth the trip and then decide it isn't.  The main characters are more like caricatures; Collins has no idea how to flesh them out and make them come alive for us.  And the plot is not so simple as simple-minded.  Big bad government turns poor innocent children into gladiators for fun and games.  And of course somewhere down the line there has to be a romance between the boy and the girl.  The whole thing sounds like a bad comic book.  Actually, the overall story has been much better told in Koushun Takami's "Battle Royale" and Stephen King's "The Running Man".  But unlike Collins, these authors know how to write.  "The Hunger Games" would probably have been a much better book if somebody else had written it.  Judy Lind
A saga that seems timeless. A young heroine who pulls a hero into her orbit. A tale of survival in a cruel, insensitive society. A make believe world, brought to life by a skilled writer. On to the next in the series!
This is my third time reading this book and so after this I am gonna finish the rest of the series for a third time. Every time I read this it feels like I am reading it for the first time. THIS BOOK NEVER GETS OLD!!!
Oh My God... ! O_O I WILL recommend this book to EVERYONE !! This book is not only a ROMANCE packed novel, but an ACTION as well. And I love it! :) This book is definitely at the TOP of my FAVORITE BOOKS list as well.
I am a believer that you must read the book before seeing the movie however, in this case the movie had me intrigued! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and instantly hunted down the second and third upon completing them.
This is an amazing book! I saw the movie before i read the book which made it easier to read because i knew what was gonna happen and it was just amazing! I LOVE the hunger games and i especially LOVE Josh Hutcherson!
My students started after me about this series last year. Of course, I had it in my ever-growing pile but when I got my hands on the audiobook it became even harder for me to resist... not that I purposely was! I spend over an hour in the car a day traveling to and from work and I have found that audiobooks are a God-send!  These books truly are "the next Harry Potter" for a multitude of reasons. I loved Katniss as a narrator and the complete view we get of her. Collins has written her so well and I felt like I was right with her throughout her journey. Stress, fatigue, emotional outbursts, loss and just plain ole confusion were felt through Katniss as she was learning to be the citizen representing her district. Many times female authors are thought to only be able to write romance (or "the mushy stuff" as my boys say), but Collins has proved them all wrong. Yes, there is a "love story" woven throughout but it is in no way mushy.  As I was listening to Katniss' survival in the Hunger Games I was brought back to my eleventh grade English class when we read The Lord of the Flies. That book amazed me because of the raw nature of the boys and what they did to survive and Katniss reminds me of that. She did what she had to do to survive and surprised herself most of all throughout her trials and tribulations. I am glad that I don't have to wait for Catching Fire or even Mockingjay because I have them both on my shelf and on audiobook.  For those of you wondering... I am TEAM PEETA all the way!
In a future society, there exists the country of Panam, made up of twelve districts plus the Capitol, which rules over all.  As punishment for an earlier rebellion by the districts, the reaping and Hunger Games competition  is now put on by the capitol each year.  A boy and a girl between the ages of 12-18 are chosen from each district to compete in this bloody competition where only one survivor remains at the end.  When Katniss Everdeen's younger sister is chosen, Katniss makes the ultimate sacrifice and volunteers to go in her sisters place.  Katniss cannot even begin to think about the unimaginable horrors she will face as she enters her quest to win The Hunger Games, but will enter with bravery and hope that her hunting skills will assist her.  What she cannot imagine is the twists and turns that will occur as the Gamemakers look for maximum entertainment value for the viewers in the capitol and districts.  This is one of the best books that I can remember reading.  I could not put it down and finished it in a little over a day.  The tension was unbearable and did not let up for a second.  The world that Suzanne Collins has built draws the reader right in, and the characters (even some of the lesser ones) are memorable.  You will be cheering for Katniss from page one, as you learn her history and the hardships she has already faced in her young life.  Recommended for adults and older teens (there is violence)...but make sure you have a solid day or two to devote to reading this addictive novel!
The Game of Hunger    This action-packed book by Suzanne Collins has a lot of violence.  The Hunger Game is fiction, but there is some truth to all the violence. The North American government of Panama makes twenty four randomly selected children kill each other on the battlefield. This cruel government is doing this to remind its citizens not to rebel. Katniss, a 16 year old girl that volunteered for the games to make sure her 12 year old sister does not have to fight, shows true quick-wittedness and bravery on the battlefield.  Katniss has to kill the twenty-three other teenagers, or be killed herself.    During battle, love blossoms between Katniss and another contestant named Peeta. It is hard for them to connect emotionally, because Katniss likes another person back home named Gale with whom she hunts. Katniss feels guilty about the relationship, because at first she pretends to love Peeta only to win favor from the crowd which would help her in battle. Although her love was false at the beginning, she grew to genuinely like Peeta. Katniss knew that Gale would be watching, and she could never really decide who she liked best.    The book is intense and it grabbed my attention from the start. It is a great book that has twists and turns throughout. The government gives advantages to certain people and tries to eliminate the love between Katniss and Peeta.  This book is quite exciting.  It is gut-wrenching, incredibly entertaining, and a book that everyone should read.  -Patrick Kurzner
I could not stop reading it, it had me hooked until the end. I wanted to continued with the next book right away cause I was so intrigued by what would come next only to find myself wanting the story to be prolonged.
I saw the movie first, and then decided to read the book....I wasn't disappointed.  I like that I was able to expand on the movie that I liked.  I will not be waiting for the next movie before reading the rest though

Okay,well i bought this book on friday and it came on the 17,of november.When i got it,the first page was awsome,really good beginning.The first page makes you laugh.Okay i got this book because i was looking for a book to read for my english class.You see we have reading logs and you have to read a book you choose and write a description of what you read.Well its been today-November 25,2008.All of my descriptions are very long!I always fill up a whole page.:D okay back to why i got this.So i went to amazon and started looking for books that could happen to me and well feels realistic and just makes you want to read it and makes you have a laugh and just helps you develop new words. This is my book!! and i thanks to Suzanne Collins for making this book. -Great Book.I'm still reading it and the characters are awsome.Katniss sounds like my mom,when she was a kid.If there was a spanish version,i would recommend it to my mom so she can really understand it.Well i can, also now that i think of it,just recommend it to her. Its a book that will make you read and you would want to see what happens to katniss and Peeta in the tournament.oh and i forgot about Haymitch.It was so awsome when Katniss threw that knife to Haymitch to show him off.:) Im on page right now,61.I'm writing this in the 25,November.SUZANEE COLLINS,YOU BETTER MAKE THAT SECOND BOOK!,SO I CAN KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXTS.I LOVE THIS BOOK.EVEN MY STATUS IN MYSPACE SAYS IS READING THE BOOK CALLED"THE HUNGER GAMES" BY SUZANNE COLLINS. :) yeah!!!!
I started this book not knowing what to really expect, over four of my closest friends recommended to me that this was a book I MUST read. I have to say The Hunger Games totally threw me. I was so shocked that a book about kids killing kids came so highly recommended. I starting the book not knowing how I felt about it, the main story line insisted that 24 will enter and only 1 will leave. I find it hard to get into a story where I know that everyone you come into contact will have to eventually die. I still can't tell you how I actually feel about this book, the story is so creative and so original. This story will haunt me for the rest of my live. I found myself unable to put this book down for even a moment. I was so worried that I couldn't sleep through the night without finding out happened with Katniss and Peeta. I was so upset that children were killing each other and so tortured by the thought that this was their governments punishment for the rebellion of district 13. I was so touched by Katniss' sacrifices and Peeta's love. This story is unbelievable and so believable at the same time its hard to come to terms with story line. But I fell in love with the characters and found myself trying to put myself in their place trying to think of ways to help them. Sorry this is so vague but I wouldn't ruin this story line for anything. It was shocking and surprising and wonderful it will leave you biting your fingers begging for more of Petta and Katniss, and hoping and praying that they survive.
This book is a must read for all, ranging from young teens to mature adults. No matter what genres interest you, The Hunger Games will suck you in regardless. With constant obstacles and challenges the protagonist character must overcome, there are few dull moments in the book. On top of the thrilling action of the games, the book provides romance, a social message, and an intriguing plot to entice the reader. After finally reading the book, it is no mystery why an award winning movie was created. I highly recommend the book but I must offer fair warning that you may end up staying up past your bedtime as it is difficult to put this book down.  The Hunger Games will have you questioning the morals of our society while you're rooting against a futuristic representation of North America. As the protagonist, Katniss Everdeen is forced to overcome great economic adversity; the Capitol of the country lives a lavish lifestyle. Through Katniss' district and the Capitol, you will realize the faults of our own society but also be grateful for the political and economic fortune we have in the US today. It is easy to develop an attachment to Katniss as she grows throughout the book. She represents hope for humanity in a world gone astray and at the same time is threat the dystopian society of Panem which makes her all the better. Katniss' fight for survival is sure to entertain the readers; whether or not they are looking for violent action or innocence of humanity amidst the cruelty of society.
Holy crud.  I took this book from the library out as a reccomendation from a friend. It blew me away...  It is BRUTAL. Violent and vile.  But Collin's writes with such finisse that you can just accept it as part of a story.  The characters-a good place to start as any.  I read a LOT and it is VERY rare that you come across one strong character, let alone a bookful.  Katniss is really one of the strongest protaganist's I have ever had the pleasure of learning.  She shows hard edges but truly is compassinate.  Ruth, anyone?  She is a hard worker and is not the sloppy romance driven heroine everyone seems to love so much.  CoughcoughTwilightcoughcough  Peeta was pretty awesome.  Though he isn't my fave, he's pretty close.  We always expect guys to be dark, brooding, and hiding some secret involving fangs, but he most certainly is not.  He's softer than Katniss, but he too can be strong.  Gale? Ehhhh.  You can't say much without me giving away the next two books...  Haymitch!  Yay Haymitch! I lobe Haymitch.  He's my fave, him and Pressy Snow :) &lt;3  I think that everyone loves Haymitch up until...oh I shan't give it away!!!  But I still LOBE him &lt;3  The plot?  I won't say.  It's in the description and I won't give anything away...  A great book for YA's-don't for it over to a nine year old though this is the least disturbing.  My mum read it and she's doing her book club on it.  Probs for 12 up or so.  I say you buy this from a BOOKSTORE.  Trust me here-this is SOMETHING you'll want to keep.
I was pretty hesitant to read this book because, to be honest, the story line sounded awful. But my sister insisted that it was fantastic and that I should read it. And since she's so bossy I did. I'm glad I did. I loved it!  This is not a happy book for the most part. The characters have had hard lives and the main part of the book is set in a to-the-death competition. It was very well-written though and I had a hard time putting it down. Many people died here, but for the most part they weren't gross (well, one was). The characters were interesting and the whole idea of what America had become was intriguing.  Even though the book isn't 'happy' there was a feeling of hope and strength. That maybe change was possible although it might be hard. I didn't come away depressed or sad - I came away thinking 'that was a great book'. But be warned that there will be another book or maybe more so there's no closure.  The story is told in first person present which totally bugs me. I hate that style. After a while though it didn't bug and I was totally sucked in. So maybe I don't hate the style...  And I just want to give a shout out to Peeta and say that if he gets hurt in later books there will be PROBLEMS. I love that boy.  Go read this book. But read it before you hand it to your teens to make sure you're okay with it. I do think this is a great example of a fractured society, one without God, and much, much, much better than say, Lord of the Flies.  *taken from my goodreads review
Read the book before you watch the movie.  Some things make more sense.  I will say that the book was an easy read, really enjoyed it, and devoured it in one day.  Well written and great for an easy, leisurely read.
I couldn't put this book down.  Can't wait to finish this review and start the next book in the series.  I thought the book would be repulsive...kids killing each other....on tv....adults taking bets.  Well written!
It took me a year and a half to finish this book. I picked it up on a flight to Japan and read almost all the way through it, but stopped before reaching the end (I finally finished it about a month ago). It wasn't the gore that made me put the book down, but the dull and plagiarized storyline. I don't want to sound like a broken record, but I too am a huge fan of Koushun Takami's "Battle Royale," and I love the idea of corrupt governments initiating a fight-to-the-death match between children. Collins could have done so much with the storyline, but her book was a flop.  First of all (and most disappointing), was the cheesy romance. It did not fit the theme of the book at all. This was supposed to be a story about pitting children against children until one was left standing. In a book like that, there is no room for corny proclamations of love. It was utterly ridiculous, too overdone and ultimately took away from the storyline.  Another deal breaker for me was that almost half of the story took place outside of the arena. Some of it was interesting but mostly it was a bland description of training and a cheesy scene where the couples prance around in costumes.  Because "The Hunger Games" was partially entertaining, and I do admit to enjoying the twist at the end, I'd recommend it to a friend. Although, before people begin to praise Collins as "THE NEXT J.K. ROWLING," or something, they should check out "Battle Royale" to read a true fight-to-the-death masterpiece.
The main characters in the book the Hunger games are Katniss Everdeen, Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne. Katniss is sixteen years old.  She is quiet and strong.  She is pretty with long dark hair that she often wears in a braid. She is from District 12 which is one of the poorest districts. Peeta is also from district 12 he is confident and chromatic he has loved Katniss from the day he saw her. Gale is Katniss's best friend and hunting partner, they hunt illegally. He also falls in love with her and he has black hair like her and grey eyes.  In the book they are in a Forest where they are all hunting each other. It is to the death, each district has a team of two people that have to be the last team to be alive. If the one of the district teams win they get food to supply the district, and the winners also get a huge nice house to live in. Also they sometimes drop supplies for the players for them to get an advantage, but they only get if the people vote for them to receive that supply.  The thing I liked about the book is how it had a lot of thrill and mystery. What I didn't like about the book was the love drama like twilight that it was about two boys and a girl. There was a lot of action and death, and it made the book exciting! It was hard to put down.  What I didn't like about the book is there was a lot of love drama and that I found to me was boring. It reminded me of another twilight book. Overall I would give this book a 4 out of 5 stars. It was a really good book.
I most appreciate this book for the way in which it is written. The story is told in first person present tense, so the events in the plot feel very immediate. Also there are many intense exchanges between the characters and the violence and tensions between them feel very palpable. Katniss, the protagonist of the story, explains this dystopian world and her conflicts as she experiences them in a very raw yet expressive manner. It never feels overworked or contrived. I thinks this really speaks to the talent of the author, Suzanne Collins.  The premise of the story leads the reader to ponder many of the moral and philosophical implications embedded in the book. When we root for the victory and survival of our protagonist, are we also not rooting for the death of these other teenage characters? How much of the decadence and frivolity of the Capital culture can we relate to in our contemporary one? How much would we be willing to sacrifice for a sense of security?  In a couple of ways this book falls short. I had difficulty really relating to and empathizing with the characters. Many were memorable, but I just couldn't bring myself to emotionally invest in them. The contrived romance between Katniss and her fellow district 12 tribute, Peeta, is made into an interesting plot twist,  but it is clear that this will clearly devolve into the overdone love triangle. Overall, it's worth your time, and at the very least, if this book isn't your cup of tea, you'll manage to read it quickly.
I've heard nothing but wonderful things about this book, but I didn't think I would like it: dystopian future + teenagers killing each other + blood + gore + TV =no book I want to read.  I was so wrong.  I thoroughly enjoyed The Hunger Games; there really is more to it than death and survival. Parts of the novel are surprisingly funny, and there's even an unexpected romance! I was glued to the plot, and I loved getting to know the characters as well as one can become acquainted with people who are fighting for their lives. Katniss's first person POV is intensely believable-what she chooses to tell and how she tells it are in perfect sync.  This book is also one that stayed with me; I finished it last week and I've been thinking about it ever since. In the world of The Hunger Games, death is televised entertainment, and the whole set-up is disconcertingly similar to current reality TV shows--it's an odd mix of Big Brother and the Olympics with the exception of people murdering each other. One person's misfortunes are the entertainment of millions. Moreover, many readers have trouble swallowing the cruelty of "The Hunger Games"-how could people allow this to happen? I struggled with this as well, but I kept reminding myself that people have allowed their governments to carry out all kinds of atrocities throughout history.  This book certainly leaves one with much to think about.  ...and I can hardly wait forCatching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)!
Couldnt gat enough. Loved it from cover to cover. What an impressable imagination With a definate bend in clarity.. or not. Nothing short of brillant. I will say though that the boyfriend did get a little tiresome.
The story was spectacular, heartwarming and breath taking. The most exciting part was during the game itself and how the main characters survived the ordeal. I enjoyed every moment of it. Would highly recommend it.
Simply put, wow. I had an idea what this book was when I picked it up. A friend of mine suggested it to me, and I admit to being extremely curious about it. But, wow, knowing doesn't really prepare you for the book. I have a lot of thoughts about this book, but I'm honestly not sure if I could express them.  The story was amazing and the plot was very well played. While I felt that Collins didn't hold back, it was easy to believe that the audience was following a 16 year-old girl. I enjoyed the narrative style she used and the POV. Using the first person present tense really put the reader into Katniss' head, as well as placing them in the thick of the action. Because of this, Katniss' internal struggle with the Games and her feelings towards Peeta felt like my own.  It was hard to read about children being put in this God-awful situations and forced to become little more than animals for entertainment. Granted, I understand some of the motivation behind the Capitol's power play, but that doesn't make it any better or any easier. The horror of this misuse of children is then increased by adding all of the Gamekeepers' actions to increase viewership and sponsor interest. It really makes you take a closer look at our capitalistic society.  The end of the book was no less then heart rending! Once the Games have finally ended, you hope for some small sliver of hope, but you are denied it.  This book definitely goes on my list of "The Best Books of All Time."
My friend insisted, urged and basically pressured me into reading this book -  honestly, I am glad she did, I read the first 9 chapters in one sitting, I didn't want to put the book down because I didn't want it to end. I wanted to keep going and I wanted to know more and what was going to happen next.  I finished the book over the next two days (because I had to work. It took me so long)  this book. To call it 'amazing' is an understatement, the entire idea of Panem amazed me, the thought of people having to compete in these brutal 'Hunger Games' events stunned me. I have now purchased "Catching Fire" and honestly I cannot wait to read it, I am now re-reading 'The Hunger Games' while I await for "Catching Fire."  Suzanne Collins has created something indescribable, this book, like I said before, stunned me. I am hooked, the story is written through the eyes of the main character, Katniss Everdeen (the name DOES grow on you)  throughout the book you know what is she is doing 24/7. You feel the anger, the rage, the loneliness and abandonment, the dreading fear and the uncertainty. When I reached the final chapters I even felt a little unhinged being inside of her head for so long and then being thrown back into civilization as she was.  I am thankful my friend recommended this book to me and now I even find myself talking about it non-stop and trying to get more of my friends into this amazing story. I am hungry for more of 'The Hunger Games' and I cannot wait to complete the trilogy.
Wow.  I did not hear of The Hunger Games until the movie came out. I didn't even know it was a book until I heard some women talking about reading it together. One of them said, "There's an older lady in one of my classes - she's about 40 (~cough cough~ older? oh dear) - and she said she wasn't going to read it because it's a kid's book. But once she started reading it she said she couldn't put it down." The statement made me curious so I checked Amazon. Sure enough, there was a Kindle copy, and it was pretty cheap. I had nothing to lose by purchasing it.  I could NOT put this book down. It was well-written, the story unfolds easily, and I was in awe of the idea. To those people who think this is about children killing children, I assert that it is not. This is a story about the potentially horrendous and devastating power of government. The reader is sympathetic to the beautifully-constructed characters, the settings are well-described and easy to imagine, and there is triumph in the relationships the characters form with each other. The backstories and the easily-understood new words that Suzanne Collins creates help to make this book stand out among its many contemporaries.  This was probably my favorite book of the trilogy, probably because it was the first one and it enraptured me so, and I am jealous of those readers who have not had a chance to dive in yet. I will read this set of books again, but there will never be another first time. ENJOY IT!
Summary: Katniss Everdeen lives in Panem. Panem is the former Untied States. Instead of fifty states, there is now twelve districts. The book starts on the day of the Reaping. That is when they choose 2 people from each district, a boy and a girl, to fight in the Hunger Games. Katniss has the surprise of her life, when her sister Primrose is called in to the Hunger Games. Kat volunteers to take her place.  The boy that has to enter is Peeta Mellark from her district, he is the baker's son. She is dragged off to the capital, leaving her family and Gale. Gale is her sort of crush and she hunts with him. In the capital, Kat prepares for the Hunger Game. Her only help is Haymitch, a former winner and the drunk in their district.  The Hunger Games is a 24-man-enter-1-man-leaves event. Luckily, Katniss is skilled, but will that make her a target. Also, this whole event is televised.  "Welcome to the Hunger Games; may the odds be ever in your favour."  My Review: This book was very addictive and original. I could not stop reading it. The characters are fantastic and seemed like people that I could be friends with. Also I don't usually like dystopia, but it was great. I heard from so many people, that this book is amazing and it was. Every chapter ends with a cliffhanger that makes it so you have to continue reading. I also liked the fact that I could total picture this, by looking at current reality TV. In short, I highly recommend The Hunger Games and look forward to the second book.
I find the theme of violence as a form of mass entertainment most interesting and poignant feature of this book.  This is a relevant reflection on our modern culture where public excessive/dramatic/blatant confrontations and exposures seem to have been replacing analyses and dialogues, evidenced by the populatiry of certain shows and radio programs, and so called Dr. programs where professional credits of the hosts are not as important as their ability to bark loud and dismiss dramatically.  It is also evidenced by increasingly violent computer games--grandauto theft (?), and all the war games--It has been a rather speedy progression from Pac Man, Centipedes eating dots, don't you think? (I don't know who to thank for this progressive evolution of humanity and useful application of resources and technology)  I am giving only 3 stars because although I agree that the violence is an absolute necessity of the story,  it is rather ironic that the author of this book also seems to use violence excessviely as a focal interest of this book, which I find problematic and decreases the poignancy of the characters.  I also felt that some turns in the story (I won't spoil) seem a bit too Hollywood, meaning, put in there to force (manipulate) rollercoaster emotions in the reader.(I heard that this may be made into a movie, surprise, surprise! how brilliantly ironic if true!)  This wasn't a bad book, but I think there are better books on dystopia--The Giver, The Handamaid's Tale, for example.
I have to admit, the premise of this book sounded very childish and plain stupid to me initially.  It sounded much more boring than it really is.  I imagined it being like a gladiator tournament, but there's much more to it than that.  Because of the countless rave reviews and my friends who've never not recommended it, I finally decided to read it.  I'm a relatively slow reader even with books I'm thoroughly enjoying, but I blazed through this.  Suzanne Collins writing is utterly phenomenal.  She writes characters in such a way that we see their flaws and qualities without being beaten over the head with them.  She writes every character in the book with their own distinct personalities and I ended up feeling like I understood each character on numerous levels.  Collins' biggest quality as a writer is her ability to explain details.  She gives vivid details on the setting, facial expressions, body language, etc.  Often I've read novels that while I'm enjoying the plot, I have a difficult time imagining what the author is trying to describe.  Or sometimes I see an author is describing too much making the pace very slow.  Collins finds a perfect balance that had me reading this novel in a matter of days (which I usually take extended breaks from novels).  This is one of a few books I've ever read that had me leaning in while reading to see what's going to happen.  I was anxious to get back to the book after a day or so.  Can't recommend this enough.
So... 125,764 reviews on Good Reads, and another 18,382 on Amazon. How could I possibly add to any of them! Very short review then.  How clever to take the main genre of current TV - the reality contestant elimination show and make it something evil and very, very nasty - a fight to the death that the whole of society must watch, and every night of the week. Plus, the contestants are children, fighting for food to feed their own. As a parent I had no desire at all to indulge my reading or movie viewing time in this contrived and utterly senseless story making.  However, by the very virtue of being a parent, you do become entwined in your children's interests. So now that the second movie is out, passionately embraced  by 16 year old, I thought maybe it was time! And yes I am glad I did. Great plot, terrific characters, lots of twists and turns right up to the last page.  The best part about this novel, and I am sure the others in the series are the same,  is what great heroes the three main characters are to young readers. In an age when young girls feel they have to wear very few clothes and twerk themselves to get attention and young boys feel they have to drink themselves stupid and prey on young vulnerable fellow teens, such fine characters as these Katniss, Peeta and Gale are very inspiring. No wonder these books have been such a hit.  Looking forward to reading the next instalment of Katniss, Peeta and Gale. Off to the movies I go!
I read Hunger Games about a year ago, just before seeing the movie.  I enjoyed the book, but wasn't hungry to read the other two books in the series.  I wasn't sure if it was a teen romance, snub at reality TV, or political masterpiece.  The book, as all three books, was told through the eyes of sixteen year-old Catniss Everdeen, the main character who nobly takes her sister's place at the annual reaping.  For those who aren't familiar with the movie or book, the story is about Catniss, the stand-up girl who takes her sister's place as a player in the annual Hunger Games.  The Games are kind of like a dark version of Survivor, the former TV show, except instead of an island the players are trapped inside of immense high-tech dome-arena.  The only way to win the game is to live with murder being a main part of game strategy.  To add more pressure onto the child contestants, the Capitol (government) controls the environment inside of the arena-dome through a computerized switchboard capable of changing the weather, creating a natural disaster, adding wild animals, and other ways to die.  Catniss does what she has to in order to survive.  At the end of the game she and Peta, a boy contestant from her hometown of District 12, refuse to kill each other.  They plan a double suicide while being filmed live on television, giving the book a Romeo-Juliet flavor.  At the last moment, the Capitol declares them both winners to save themselves from the bad publicity.  4.5/5 Stars
The author has a way with the action. Love death traps, and this series has clever death traps and well-executed dramatic moments galore. Unfortunately the characters are terrible. I hate the way the two obvious love interests sacrifice everything to vie for the affections of the heroine whose only admirable qualities seems to be love for her sister and an ability to survive at any cost. About the only time she really shown as anything but a survival automaton was when she shot that arrow in the direction of those dudes -- and she regretted it immediately.  These books remind me of the Cube movies, which I totally enjoyed regardless of the low budget and poor acting. But I'd have to say the Cube movies were just generally better conceived than these books that take place in a dysfunctional-to-the-point-of-silly society. A society that is somehow run by a guy who is portrayed as all creepy evil the whole time but is apparently supposed to be multi-dimensional because he claims to mean well at the end? Even when leaders are terrible, they usually mean well. And bad leaders that mean well usually have some kind of either twisted and cocky or overly pragmatic outlook that makes sense from a cold, calculating, cynical perspective. There is nothing about this poverty-ridden yet wasteful society that makes sense from a pragmatic perspective that gives the evil leader dude call to even claim that he meant well(especially after just being totally evil until the last second).
Sixteen-year-old Katniss is a survivor. Katniss struggles to provide for her mother and young sister by hunting and gathering after her father dies. In a future where the US has fallen, the result of brutal wars has left 12 districts governed by cruel dictators. Each year the government chooses a boy and girl from each district to participate in the Hunger Games - a fight to the death, televised for all to see. The Hunger Games are a punishment on the districts for a long-ago uprising against the Capitol. This year, Katniss is shocked when her young sister's name is chosen to participate from the lottery. So Katniss volunteers to take her place, along with Peeta - the son of the district's baker. The two have little fighting skills compared to other districts' participants who have been training their whole lives for this event.  Katniss is a completely engaging character. I usually can't stand present tense narrative, but Collins' writing pulled me in nonetheless. I was pulled in from the start, and couldn't let go. It's a story of love, friendship, surviving, violence, and death. The reader experiences everything that Katniss does, and experiences a full range of emotions. Collins' characters are truly stunning.  This is an immensely popular trilogy, and I now know why. With an abundance of drama and suspense, this futuristic science fiction novel for young adults will appeal to readers young and old. It's breathtaking and a fantastic adventure from beginning to end.
This book mixes the themes of science fiction, action, adventure, fantasy, and horror.  The Hunger Games are an annual event created by the Capitol of Panem, a place which used to be the United States.  They are a reminder to each of the twelve Districts who is in charge of the world.  For the games, one boy and one girl are chosen from each district to be put into an arena and fight to the death, all for the entertainment of the Capitol.  Katniss Everdeen volunteers to be the girl "tribute" from district twelve in the place of her younger sister; the boy tribute is Peeta Mellark, the son of the town baker.  Katniss truly believes she will die in the Games, but is it luck that she always manages to live through each day in the arena? Or does the Capitol have a good reason to keep her alive?  This book is completely captivating.  There are always surprises that keep you turning the page.  My piece of advice about reading this book is NEVER read it unless you have hours of free time, because once you start, it is nearly impossible to stop.  I would recommend this book for the most for high school students, but adults and middle schoolers might also enjoy this book.  The Hunger Games has well deserved much praise from the New York Times, USA Today, Entertainment Weekly and others.  It's story is one of danger, love, and keeping true to yourself, even if you are at the mercy of power so big and dangerous that you can never back down once you are the center of their attention.
Hunger Games is exceptionally well written with great character development, rich context of settings, expertly crafted dialogue and action; however, the actual story is awful and ferocious, as children are pitted in a fight to the death arena "Hunger Games" for the entertainment and utility of a futuristic oppressive government.  The children become killers in the arena engaging in brutal warfare against one another as they are spurred on by the evil "Gamemakers."  I can't believe that this book and series is promoted as teen genre. Although it obviously appeals to readers, it certainly conveys graphic, horrible killing and savagery to impressionable minds. I'm not so sure we want our children meditating on other children killing each other for the sport of adults. Unlike Narnia, LOTR and Harry Potter, this series so far lacks the good v. evil theme that is apparent and defined in the other series.  Here there is good amidst the evil but it is all in anarchy.  A book is set in what appears to be a godless society; however, godly virtues persist among some members of the population. There are very moving and emotional scenes of virtue.  In this setting, where does the inspiration for virtues of love, sacrifice, loyalty and faithfulness come from? This seems to be a contradiction in the overall meta-narrative of the book, but on the other hand, maybe that is the point.  This is an very entertaining book but the substance is also very troubling.
The book is very amazing. It makes me feel things I never have felt before. It makes you feel intensity, passion, etc. Long story short, I could read this book over and over again and still never get tired of it.
I L-O-V-E-D this book. From the moment of the reaping to the end of what seemed to be the end of Katniss and Peeta. I would recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it yet. You'll be in for quite a surprise.
Initially I wasn't interested in reading this book because the premuse  of terns being forced to kill one another did not appeal to me. But a friend  convinced me to give it a try and I'm glad that I did.
One of the best young adults novels I've read. The very non-conventional ending makes it stand apart from other books. I'd recommend it to any adult or young adult that whats to read something new and refreshing.
This was recommended to me by a friend. My response? I told him recently that I wanted a money back guarantee! Eh, no need. I picked this up, waiting for any excuse to set it aside, and the only excuse I had, was that I just finished it. I've never heard of Suzanne Collins, and the opportunity to read something this good isn't something that happens all the time!  Enter the world of Katniss Everdeen, who lives in district 12, which is part of a place that was once North America. Welcome to a world of survival. And welcome to The Hunger Games! Katniss shows great sacrifice by taking the place of her little sister, Prim, entering a fight to the death against other participants. The boy selected from district 12 is Peeta, who Katniss knows only as the baker's boy. They will take on a game of life and death, made up of skill for skill.  This is a great story of survival, guts, heart, madness, and even romance at times. Nothing is taken for granted, and alliances are measured heavily!  While immediately reluctant to give this a try, I find myself hungry for another helping of what Suzanne Collins will be serving up. Nothing could've prepared me for how good she really is. And when I say that, I could actually put her in a class with Gary Paulsen! That isn't to say that HATCHET has been replaced. But is now has some rather hefty competition. In saying that, there's only one thing that will satisfy the growling in my gut. And that's more HUNGER GAMES in a big, big way!!
